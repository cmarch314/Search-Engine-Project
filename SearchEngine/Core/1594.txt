A series of related\ngraphs may arise from one relation between a set of objects as it\nevolves through time or from several relationships defined on the same\nset of objects. In simultaneous graph embedding, nodes are placed in\nthe exact same locations in all the graphs and a series of graphs are\nsimultaneously embedable if it is possible to find locations that\nyield straight-line crossing-free drawings for each of the individual\ngraphs. We present polynomial time algorithms for simultaneous\nembedding of various classes of planar graphs and prove that some\nclasses of graphs cannot be simultaneously embedded. Further, we\npresent a near-linear time algorithm for visualizing graphs that\nevolve through time and demonstrate its application to problems in\nsoftware engineering and databases.\n\n<p>VITA:\nStephen Kobourov is an Assistant Professor at the University of\nArizona.
