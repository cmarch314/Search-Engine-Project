The choice of projects can be very open-ended; ideally you can incorporate their own research. But your class project must be about new things you have done this semester; you can't use results you have developed in previous semesters.  People can work individually or in teams of two.<br>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Project grading</h2> Recall the project is worth half the class grade.<br>\n\n<p>\n<b> Project Proposal</b> (due May 18th 11 am in EEE dropbox) 10% of project grade<br>\nThe proposal should include a title, roughly 2 paragraphs describing the project idea, and a list of 1-3 relevant papers. If you will be collecting your own images, describe any special experimental procedure (restriction of illumination conditions, the use of projectors, etc.). If we do not have the facilities here, you may be able to email authors of a paper for their collected data. If you will be using a standard image dataset, include a pointer to it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b> Final Writeup</b> (due June 9th, 1:30 pm in EEE dropbox) 60% of project grade<br>\nYou must prepare a writeup using the given <a href=\"cvprkit.tgz\">CVPR</a> latex format. There is a strict page limit of 8 pages including references. A single writeup is required per project.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b> Presentation</b> (June 9th, 1:30-3:30 pm) 30% of project grade.<br>\nYou must prepare a presentation with a strict time limit of 10 minutes.\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2> Project ideas </h2>\nAgain, you are strongly encouraged to find a project aligned with their own research interests.
