Redistricting</B></U>\r\n\r\n<P><B>The seats in the House of Representatives are allocated to the states\r\non the basis of the population determined by the decennial census. Each\r\nstate then has the responsibility of establishing geographical districts,\r\nusually one district for every seat. The district decisions are often made\r\nby the legislature or by the legislature and the governor. The party in\r\npower tries to create districts which will maximize the number of seats\r\nthe party can win. The geographical nature of districts is a fine art with\r\na long history. The design extremes are known as gerrymandering after somebody\r\nnamed \"gerry\" who practiced the art.</B>\r\n\r\n<P><B>In recent years, computer graphics has played a large part in the\r\ndevelopment of district design.
