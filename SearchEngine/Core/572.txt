Topics will hopefully include error correction and fault-tolerant\ncomputation as well as quantum cryptography.\n\n<h3> Prerequisites </h3>\nNo formal course requirements. Students with a strong background in\neither computer science, mathematics, physics or chemstry are welcome to attend.\n\n<h3> Course Requirements </h3>\nProblem sets will be given every  two weeks.\nStudents are also expected to provide typed and formatted\nscribe notes for two or three lectures which will be posted on\nthe course web page. Students may elect to do a project in lieu of the last\nproblem set. This could be a paper (original work or survey paper) or a\npresentation in class.\n\n<h3>  Reading list </h3>\nThere is no required text for the course.\nThe following is a list of books and course notes that may be useful.\nAt the beginning of each lecture, I will point to recommended references\nfor the material to be presented.\n\n<UL>\n<li>Kitaev, Shen and Vyalyi, <u>Classical and Quantum Computation</u></li>\n<li>Nielsen and Chuang, <u>Quantum Computation and Quantum\nInformation</u></li>\n<li> Mermin, <u> Quantum Computer Science </u> </li>\n<li> Umesh Vazirani's Course Notes on Quantum Computation:\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/quantum.html\">\nlink. </a> </li>\n<li> John Preskill's Course Notes on Quantum Computation:\n<a href=\"http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html#lecture\">\nlink </a> </li>.\n<li> Scott Aaronson's Course Notes on Quantum Complexity Theory:\n<a href=\"http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa08/6.896/materials.html\">\nlink </a> </li>.\n<li> Scott Aaronson's Course Notes on Quantum Computing Since Democritus:\n<a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/\">\nlink </a> </li>.\n<li> Qubits, Quantum Mechanics and Computers: Course Notes\n<a href=\"http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs191/fa08/\">\nlink </a>.\n<li> Andrew Child's course on Quantum Algorithms:\n<a href=\"http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~amchilds/teaching/w08/co781.html\">\nlink </a>.\n\n</UL>\n\n<!--\n<h3> Homework </h3>\n\n<table border>\n<tr>\n\n\n<th>\nDue Date\n</th>\n<th>\nLink\n</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 20\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"hw1.pdf\"> Homework 1 </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 3\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"hw2.pdf\"> Homework 2 </a>\n</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>\nNov 19\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"hw3.pdf\"> Homework 3 </a>\n</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>\nDec 11\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"hw4.pdf\"> Homework 4</a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n-->\n\n<h3> Lecture Topics </h3>\n\n<table border>\n<tr>\n\n<th>\nDate\n</th>\n<th>\nTopic\n</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nSep 24\n</td>\n<td>\nQuantum Mechanics Postulates, Qubits\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nSep 29\n</td>\n<td>\nObservables, Hamiltonian, Schrodinger's Eqn\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 1\n</td>\n<td>\nTensor products, Entanglement, Bell Inequalities\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 6\n</td>\n<td>\nQuantum circuits, Universal gate sets\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 8\n</td>\n<td>\nQuantum Complexity Classes, QFT over Z_2^N Deutsch-Jozsa\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 13\n</td>\n<td>\nBQP in PSPACE, Simon's Algorithm\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 20\n</td>\n<td>\nQFT over Z_N, Factoring reduces to Order Finding\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nOct 29\n</td>\n<td>\nShor's Factoring Algorithm\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 3\n</td>\n<td>\nFactoring Recap, Hidden Subgroup Problem\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 5\n</td>\n<td>\nPhase Estimation, Discrete Log\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 10\n</td>\n<td>\nLower Bound for Unstructured Search\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 12\n</td>\n<td>\nGrover Search, Quantum Simulation\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 17\n</td>\n<td>\nSearch by Quantum Walk\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 19\n</td>\n<td>\nQuantum Hitting Time\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nNov 24\n</td>\n<td>\nQuantum Walk Algorithm for Search and Element Distinctness\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nDec 1\n</td>\n<td>\nAdiabatic Quantum Computation\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nDec 3\n</td>\n<td>\nQMA-completeness\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nDec 8\n</td>\n<td>\nError Correcting Codes\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 572.0}
