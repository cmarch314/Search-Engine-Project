When two\nmature organizations merge, there are significant process assets which\nmust be combined under a common process improvement strategy. An\norganization's policies, procedures, assigned responsibilities,\nmeasurements and analysis, quality assurance program, and management\nreviews reflect their unique corporate cultures. Combining two cultures\nrequires a synthesis of these two sets of process assets, and coping\nwith the people issues that surround them.\n<p>\nWith mergers being commonplace in today's software community, this issue\nis timely. The same situation also arises when two (or more) software\norganizations team to support a single project. Recent teaming\nagreements have seen as many as five Level 3 contractors, and dozens\nof subcontractors, teaming to develop a single integrated product,\ndeveloped under a single process.\n \n<p>\n\nThese panelists represent organizations well-versed in mergers.\nThey will examine all sides of this issue, and compare and contrast\nthe approaches each of their companies have used in merging corporate\ncultures, either permanently or for a project's lifetime. The panelists\nwill offer practical lessons learned about pitfalls to avoid, and\ntechniques that work.\n<p>\n<em>Expected Benefits to Attendees:</em>\n<p>\nThe audience will understand how corporate mergers and project teaming\naffect an organization's culture, from a CMM perspective. The panelists\nwill present practical techniques for dealing with the problems of a\nmerger.\n<p>\n\n<em>Issues include:</em>\n<ul>\n   <li> Combining different sets of corporate process assets (policies,\n       procedures, process databases, etc.)\n   <li> Re-establishing senior management commitment\n   <li> Combining SEPGs\n   <li> Combining training approaches\n   <li> Combining organizations with different maturity levels\n   <li> Human issues, related to the loss of corporate identity\n</ul>\n<p>\n<!--\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\n<p>\nJean Tyson has 18 years of experience in software development \nfor medical instruments at Beckman Coulter, Inc.
