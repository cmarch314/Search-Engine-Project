I checked with my grandmother Ann Wolf (formerly\r\nWolosky) who is 91 year's old and she said she had a cousin Pesach Langsam\r\non her father's side.  He lived in Jersey City, NJ and worked for the Ward\r\nBaking Company.  Then he moved to New York City or Brooklyn, she couldn't \r\nremember and then again to San Francisco.  She also said her cousin Molly \r\nWolosky, also on her father's side was from Sanok.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.  I am curious to know if there is any connection.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMarcy Wolf\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\nmoishe@langsam.com wrote:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nVery exciting! With a name like Pesach Langsam, there must be a connection,\r\nas he was the progenitor of the branch. Can you tell me more about him \r\nand how your grandmother is related to him.

She does remember that Pesach had\r\na brother named Moishe who she thinks also lived in \r\nBrooklyn.  She knows Pesach had a wife and children and\r\nsince the last time she saw Pesach, or Philip Langsam, \r\nhe lived in  San Francisco maybe his children or \r\ngrandchildren are still there.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\nMarcy\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Tue, 25 Dec 2001 21:23:05 -0500\r\nTo: marcy@ergny.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Langsam\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nIts been a long time since we last wrote. Just wanted to keep you posted.\r\nWith the Ellis Island Database I was able to find the ship manifest for \r\nMoshe Langsam, brother to Pesach/Philip. I also found his petition for \r\nnaturalization here in Brooklyn. He was from Telesnica. This town is about\r\n15 miles SE of Sanok and 15 miles SW of Dobromil. Therefore I think that \r\nyour H71 listing on my page should be H60 under the old numbering scheme \r\nfrom the Langsam-Spira book. \r\n\r\nBased on all this data, the picture we have is that Abraham Langsam had \r\ntwo known sons, a son Pesach/Philip and a son Moishe. \r\n\r\nPesach, born in 1896, came to the USA in 1914 at the age of 18 (single).\r\nHis father Abraham was still alive and living in Telesnica, Galicia.  \r\nMoshe, born in 1898, went to Buenos Aries, Argentina. He came to the USA\r\nin 1922 at the age of 24 (single). He lists his last residence at his \r\nfriend: Enrique Edelman, B. Mitre 2574 Bnos. Aries. He states that he is \r\ngoing to brother Phillip Langsam at 236 Hopkins, Brooklyn NY. Moshe was \r\nborn in Telesnica.\r\n\r\nCan you check any of this, especially the dates, with your grandmother? \r\nDoes she remember them being about a decade older than her? \r\n\r\nAlso, on Jewishgen why do you have recorded that you are researching \r\nLangsam's from Krakow? Who was from Krakow? Is this another branch or \r\nthis one too somehow?\r\n\r\n-Moishe Miller\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\nwww.langsam.com\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"HOME\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=\"-2\">Last updated 12/26/01</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n\r\n", "id": 16167.0}
