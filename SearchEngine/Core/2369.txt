We solve the problems of orthogonal line segment\nintersection reporting, batched orthogonal range reporting and\nrectangle\nintersection reporting. To obtain nearly optimal algorithms for these\nproblems, we introduce a parallel distribution sweeping technique\ninspired by its sequential counterpart.\nWe also show how to obtain optimal algorithms for interval stabbing\ncounting, 1-D range counting, weighted 2-D dominance counting, and\nfor computing 3-D maxima, 2-D lower envelopes, and 2-D convex hulls\nvia adaptations of either the PEM merge sort algorithm or\ncorresponding PRAM algorithms. \n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2369.0}
