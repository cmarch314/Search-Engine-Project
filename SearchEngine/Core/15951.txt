{"text": "Euler s Formula Proof 15 Binary Homology Portions of the following proof are described by Lakatos who credits it to Poincar however Lakatos omits any detailed justification for the properties of the map b defined below instead treating them as axioms so the theorem he ends up proving is that that Euler s formula is true of any polyhedron satisfying these axioms but he doesn t prove that this is true of convex polyhedra Like the shelling proof this proof interprets a polyhedron or polytope as a complex of polyhedral faces of varying dimensions with fi denoting the number of faces of dimension i And like that proof we add two extra cells one for the whole polytope and one for the empty face so f 1 fd 1 We interpret the subsets of faces of dimension i as a vector space over the two element field GF 2 with vector addition being performed by symmetric difference of subsets also known as exclusive or In this way we get d 1 vector spaces Vi with dimensions equal to fi The sets of faces of the polytope can be interpreted as forming bases for these vector spaces These spaces also come equipped with a linear mapping b taking each space Vi to the next lower dimensional space defined on each face to be the set of its facets When v is a sum of faces b v is the sum of the corresponding sets of facets The empty face has no facets and a vertex is defined to have the empty face as its only facet This mapping has two very important properties Boundaries have no boundaries In other words for any vector v b b v If v is a basis vector corresponding to a single face of the polytope this is true because any ridge face two dimensions lower than v forms the boundary between two facets of v and is therefore cancelled out in the calculation of b b v In the special case of the empty face b v already and for any linear map b In the special case of a vertex b v is the empty face and again b b v The result follows as well for vectors other than the bases by linearity Any vector without a boundary is itself a boundary In other words for any vector v if b v then v b w for some w If v then we can choose w as well for nonzero v we prove this by analyzing the vectors of each dimension separately If v is in V 1 it must be the empty face itself and is the boundary of some vertex If v is in V it must consist of an even number of vertices for b v to be zero These vertices can be paired up and connected by paths then w can be taken to be the vector sum of these paths If v is in V1 it forms a set of edges meeting an even number of times at each vertex these edges can be grouped into Jordan curves and w can be taken to be the vector sum of regions bounded by these curves If v is in V2 it must be the whole set of facets of the polyhedron since we can find a path on the polyhedron boundary from any facet to any other facet avoiding vertices and none of the edges crossed by this path can be in b v So we can take w to be the single cell corresponding to the whole polyhedron Finally if v is a nonzero vector in V3 b v cannot be zero With these preliminaries out of the way we are ready to begin the proof that Sum 1i fi Let Bi denote the subspace of Vi consisting of those vectors for which b v Then the map b takes Vi to Bi 1 Whenever we have a linear map of vector spaces we can use it to decompose the original space into its nullspace the set of vectors mapped to zero here Bi and its orthogonal complement which is mapped one to one onto the image of the map This tells us that dim Vi dim Bi dim Bi 1 Plugging this expansion into the sum we are trying to evaluate gives Sum 1i fi Sum 1i dim Bi dim Bi 1 which equals zero because each term Bi appears twice with opposite signs Cancelling the two extra parameters f 1 and f3 from the sum gives the usual Euler formula I suspect there is a more direct dimensionless way of proving that boundaryless vectors are themselves boundaries but I don t see it and Lakatos doesn t describe it Homology theory one of the foundation stones of algebraic topology is devoted to defining similar vector spaces and understanding the extent to which the key equation dim Vi dim Bi dim Bi 1 fails to be true in other

proof\ninterprets a polyhedron or polytope as a complex of polyhedral\nfaces of varying dimensions, with <I>f<sub>i</sub></I> denoting the number\nof faces of dimension i.

In other words,\nfor any vector v, b(b(v))=0.\nIf v is a basis vector, corresponding to a single face of the polytope,\nthis is true because any <I>ridge</I> (face two dimensions lower than <I>v</I>)\nforms the boundary between two facets of <I>v</I>, and is therefore\ncancelled out in the calculation of b(b(v)).\nIn the special case of the empty face, b(v)=0 already and for any linear\nmap b(0)=0.  In the special case of a vertex, b(v) is the empty face\nand again b(b(v))=0.\nThe result follows as well for vectors other than the bases\nby linearity.\n<P>\n<LI>Any vector without a boundary is itself a boundary.\nIn other words, for any vector v, if b(v)=0, then v=b(w) for some w.\nIf v=0 then we can choose w=0 as well; for nonzero v\nwe prove this by analyzing the vectors of each dimension separately.\nIf v is in V<sub>-1</sub>, it must be the empty face itself\nand is the boundary of some vertex.\nIf v is in V<sub>0</sub>, it must consist of an even number of vertices\nfor b(v) to be zero.
