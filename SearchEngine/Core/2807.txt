Workspace Choosing a username If you don t want the students who you re peer grading to know your identity please pick a C9 username different enough from your name so they can t guess who you re If you don t care about them knowing just ignore this paragraph Creating a new repository Since you will share your workspace with other students you will have to create a new one for each assignment otherwise students will be able to see the stuff you re working on for this week That s far from being a smooth way to work so in order to reduce the overhead you can just clone https github com mgiorgio inf212w15 git and you will get the right structure to start working right away on your weekly homework You can clone the repository directly from Cloud 9 Create Workspace Clone repository The repository you will create must be public non private You can refer to https docs c9 io creating new workspace html for further details Choosing a repository name In Cloud 9 your workspace can be accessed in read only mode by anyone having your workspace s URL In order to cope with that situation please just put some random characters at the end of the workspace name For example if your username is abc and you are working on the HW3 you can choose something like hw3 18785 so that nobody can see your stuff unless they receive your URL Your URL will look like http ide c9 io abc hw3 18785 Protecting your workspace In order to prevent anyone else from looking at the stuff you re working on you must change the default sharing options In order to do so go to Share at the top right corner and uncheck the Public option File organization Your submission files must be organized as follows Workspace name random string Readings 2 word summary plain text file Project stop words txtsrc Source code file pride and prejudice txtREADME txt optional Before submitting your assignment Programs must be submitted ready to be executed If something needs to be changed on the code to run your program or it doesn t compile it won t be possible to evaluate your homework and you will receive zero points If it s expected that special parameters needs to be passed to execute the program a README txt file must be created in the source code s folder explaining the program must be run Submission Sharing your stuff Make your workspace public again Now that your workspace needs to be seen by your peer graders you need to make it public again In order to do so go to the Share option at the top right corner and check the Public checkbox Submitting your stuff a k a how does the TA know that you did your assignment For each assignment a text file must be uploaded to EEE containing A link to your workspace That link will be passed to your peer graders and the TA The language you used You have time to upload this file until Saturday night Keep in mind that if you solved the weekly assignment but did not upload this file your work will not be considered Peer Grading At the beginning of the quarter each student must choose at least three languages to do peer grading on other students projects For example if one student chooses Java PHP and Ruby the student will very likely receive programs written in those languages to be graded This is not guaranteed but we will do our best to assign programs written in languages that the grader feels comfortable with For each assignment students will peer grade three programs The score and comments must be uploaded to EEE Part of your score will come from your job as a peer grader Keep in mind that the score you assign to other students is as important as the feedback you give them Permission to execute stuff in C9 By default you will not have permissions to execute files in a workspace that is not yours Consequently in order to execute other students code you will request writing permissions There is going to be an option in C9 to do so when you enter the URL that they shared Rubric You will receive a rubric each week that you must use for the peer grading It is going to be as detailed as possible to minimize the deviation from different graders Summary To sum this up each week you will need to Clone the repository listed above Create a file in C9 with the summary for the assigned reading Solve the programming assignment in C9 Upload a text file to EEE with the link to your C9 s workspace and the language you used After receiving the assignments that you will peer grade Evaluate them Upload a text file to EEE with a score and comments for each assignment you are peer grading ", "_id":
