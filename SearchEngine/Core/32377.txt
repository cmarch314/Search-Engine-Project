The first session began with a mini-BOF on\nthe topic of WEBDAV searching and locating (DASL), which was led by\nSaveen Reddy.  During this mini-BOF, the goals of the working group\nwere presented, and some discussion on the group took place.\nAttendees notes that there was overlap between the issues being\nconsidered by LESSOR and DASL, however there was some agreement that\nDASL would be able to build upon the work of the LESSOR group.  At the\nend of the mini-BOF, a poll of the attendees found substantial, but\nnot unanimous, support for having a DASL working group in the IETF.\n\n<p>After the DASl mini-BOF, the WEBDAV session begain with a status\nreport on the current documents being developed by the working group,\nincluding the creation of a new versioning protocol specification, now\nthat the main protocol document is focused on distributed authoring\ncapability. During this status report, the chair announced that there\nwill be a working group last call on the distributed authoring\nprotocol document in January.\n\n<p>A discussion of open issues in the distributed authoring protocol\nspecification took place during the remainder of the session.\nFunctionality for ordered collections was discussed, with debate\ncentering on what kind of ordered collection support should be\nprovided, and whether the support should be mandatory given the\nprocessing burden on servers.  No resolution was reached, discussion\nwill continue on the list.  Security considerations were discussed\nnext, and the group reached agreement that a) the security\nconsiderations from HTTP/1.1 need to be reviewed to ensure they are\nunchanged for the domain of distributed authoring, b) WEBDAV will\nmandate use of digest authentication, c) for cases where greater\nsecurity that an unencoded session is needed, use TLS will be\nrecommended.  Finally, the working group agreed with the decisions of\nthe Design Team that the INDEX method be removed in conjunction with\nadding recursive capability to PROPFIND, and the PATCH method be moved\nto the versioning specification.\n\n<p>Access Control was the topic of the second WEBDAV session.  Howard\nPalmer led discussion on WEBDAV access control by presenting a series\nof slides highlighting design issues.  One thread discussed the\nproblem of underlying repositories having access control schemes which\nvary (e.g., by operating system), the difficulty of mapping different\nschemes into each other, and the challenge this poses for WEBDAV\naccess control.  No consensus was reached (none was expected) and\ndiscussion on access control will continue on the mailing list.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 32377.0}
