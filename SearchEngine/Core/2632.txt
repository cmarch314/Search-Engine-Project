where I am reachable by by AIM handle richardepattis MessageBoard Forums I have created a Message Board for this class and started five MessageBoard Forums I prefer students ask questions on these Forums so that everyone staff and students can see the questions and everyone can participate in answering the qusetions and exploring the answers Before posting on a topic check whether another student has already posted on that topic C and Eclipse Ask answer discuss questions about the C Programming Language the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment or how to use them together Lecture Material Ask answer discuss questions about the readings and the materials discussed in class Quizzes and Exams Ask answer discuss questions about the quizzes and exams written and programming DO NOT post solutions or any code but feel free to ask about discuss all other aspects of the quizzes and exams including asking for clarification input output examples etc be specific Programming Assignments Ask answer discuss questions about the programming assignments specification relevant Python etc DO NOT post solutions or any code but feel free to ask about discuss all other aspects of the programming assignments including asking for clarification input output examples etc be specific Find Programming Partners Find a programming partner Relevant information is your Lab partners should at least have labs meeting at the same time approximate skill level best to match with someone your own level work habits e g prefer to work days evenings weekends do don t want to work early to get extra for early submissions preferred location to work if your dorm home say where that is Feel free to ask questions and answer other students questions on these forums subject to the prohibition of posting code for Quizzes and Exams and Programming Assignments I will also read all Forums early in the morning and answer unresolved questions When you post a question choose the title line carefully first check whether that question has already been asked In past quarters the message board forum mechanism have seen a good amount of traffic course material has been clarified questions have been asked and answered and many interesting discussions have ensued But the efficacy of these discussions depends on your participation If the need for other forums arise I will create them feel free to suggest forums to me Course Email The instructor staff and all students registered for the course can send email to everyone else by emailing the address ics46 W15 classes uci edu All messages sent via this email address will be archived on the Email Archive As the instructor I will frequently use this mechanism to broadcast timely information to all the students Students should use this email address more selectively mostly you should be using the forums mentioned above to ask questions so all students can see your questions comments and participate in the discussion One reasonable student use of this email list is to send email if Checkmate the program submission system appears to be down by sending email I will learn about the problem and everyone will know I know In such a case when I bring Checkmate back up I ll send a follow up email message to everyone Finally remember to read the Announcements link daily on the course web I tend to post long lived information here rather than via the forums or email Lecture Lab Meeting Places and Times Lecture Lab s ClassroomDaysStartStopLectureEH 12 MWF11 am11 5 pmCommon LabICS 183TuTh12 pm3 5 pm It is well known but often underappreciated fact that consistent attendence of lectures lab is strongly correlated with good course performance therefore I expect all my students to attend lecures and labs regularly Plan on arriving punctually I may make important announcements at the start of a class paying attention and treating your classmates with respect If you do miss a class your first point of contact should be other students who attended the class to determine what you missed and how you can catch up see the course web too One of the most bewildering questions faculty hear is I missed class yesterday did you say or do anything important Bottom Line As a lecturer at UCI my primary responsiblity is teaching my primary activities are preparing course materials teaching in class interacting with students in class during online office hours on MessageBoard Forums and grading ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-46/fact.html", "title": "fact sheet", "html": "<!DOCTYPE
