An important virtue of weighted search schemes, especially in the context of anytime search, is that they are w-optimal, i.e. when terminated, they return a weight w, and a solution cost C, such that C \u2264 w\u00b7C* , where C* is the optimal cost.\r\nIn this paper we introduce Weighted Branch and Bound (WBB) for graphical models and provide a broad empirical evaluation of its performance compared with one of the best unweighted anytime search scheme, BRAOBB (won Pascal 2011 competition). We also compare against weighted best-first (WBF). Our results show that W BB can be superior to both un-weighted BB and to weighted BF on a significant number of instances. We also illustrate the benefit of weighted search in providing suboptimality relative error bounds.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r213.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8594.0}
