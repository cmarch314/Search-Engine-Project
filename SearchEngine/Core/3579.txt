Please send all\nreplies to the address given below.\n---------------------------------------------\n\nGiven a convex polytope in d dimensions, I would like to\ntriangulate it (into d-simplices) which has one\nof the following two properties\n\n 1.  Any line (1-face) intersects at most $O(\\log N)$\n   simplices (if the polytope has N vertices)\n\n            or\n\n 2. Every vertex is incident on a number of simplices\n     which does not depend on N (can depend on d).\n\n In 2 dimensions there are triangulation schemes where\n properties 2 or 3 can be satisfied. In 3-D property 2\n can be satisfied but I could not come up with a scheme\n to satisfy property 3. For d &gt; 3, I could not come up\n with anything. I am not even sure if such decomposition\n is possible in higher dimensions or how close can one\n get to the above conditions. More specifically, I would\nbe resaonably happy to know about triangulation schemes\n for which the bounds in (2) or (3) are $O(\\log^{d} N)$.\n\n I will be very grateful if someone can provide me with\n some useful pointers (of course an answer is always\n welcome). The motivation behind this query is algorithmic\n application.\n\n Please e-mail replies to <A HREF=\"mailto:sen@research.att.com\">sen@research.att.com</A>\n\n    Thanks in advance,\n\n                    - Sandeep Sen\n</PRE>\n", "id": 3579.0}
