The letter \"d\" is silent since combinations of\nletters like <i>adh</i> act like a vowel sound (\"aw\" as in \"raw\") in Gaelic.\nThis is a Gaelic version of the name <i>Patrick</i> which\nin turn came from the Latin/Roman name <i>Patricius</i>. \n<p>\n\n<i>Padhraic</i> is a fairly common name in Ireland (but obviously\nless common in places like California). Somewhat confusingly\nthere are multiple different spellings of the name in\nIreland, such as <i>Padraic</i> and <i>Padraig</i>. To further\nconfuse things, the pronounciation is also different\nin different parts of Ireland - in the very south\nof the country (like Cork) the name Padhraic might be pronounced\nsomething like \"Pawd-rick\", i.e., the \"d\" is pronounced and no longer\nsilent. But I'm from the West of Ireland, where \"Paw-rick\" is the\nappropriate pronounciation.\n<p>\n\nThere are other idiosyncracies to Irish names. For example\nalthough my surname is Smyth (pronounced like the regular \"Smith\") the Gaelic\nversion of this is <i>Mac Gabhann</i> which is pronounced\n\"Ma-gow-an\" (so \"abh\" acts like the vowel sound \"ow\", as in \"owl\").  Translated\nliterally, <i>Mac Gabhann</i> means ``son of the blacksmith\" (hence\nthe <i>Smith/Smyth</i> translation into English).\n<p>\n\nAnd many Irish people have the English version of their\nnames on official documents like passports (including\nme) but use their Irish names for everything else (e.g., John/Sean,\nWilliam/Liam, James/Seamus, and so on).  Its a long story,\nbut we tend to blame the English for all this confusion :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 8265.0}
