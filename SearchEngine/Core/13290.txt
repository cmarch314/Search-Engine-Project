If we are allowed to permute the children of\neach node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which\nall edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a\npolynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child\nordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show\nthat, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the\nedges as circular arcs (a style we call <a\nhref=\"p-lombardi.html\">Lombardi drawing</a>) then even with a prescribed\nchild ordering we can achieve polynomial area.\n<p>\n<li><b>Bounds on the complexity of halfspace intersections when the\nbounded faces have small dimension</b>.<br>\nD.

We use this\nconstruction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of\nall 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges\nare represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.\nWe also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble\nclusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"jour.html\">Journals</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
