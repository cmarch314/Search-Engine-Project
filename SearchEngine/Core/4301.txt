{"text": "Research Projects News Notes CV Research Summary As a software engineer I am principally interested in improving the methods and techniques for software debugging i e finding and fixing software faults I am particularly interested in developing the facilities and theory to enable software developers better understand locate and fix software faults My research currently looks at building visualizing and studying models of runtime behavior of software components in order to facilitate software debugging which is a complex and ubiquitous activity within software engineering Models for studying runtime behavior of software often suffer from information overload given that even moderately sized software programs which typically range from 1 1 KLOC often encompass millions of runtime actions that need to be accounted for My work looks at solutions that facilitate analysis and comprehension of software executions in ways that combat information overload by a abstracting or summarizing program behavior and b globally visualizing program executions Following are brief descriptions of the projects I have worked on Discriminating Dynamic Influences Dynamic slicing is an analysis that operates on program execution models e g dynamic dependence graphs to sup port the interpreation of program execution traces Given an execution event of interest i e the slicing criterion it solves for all instruction execution events that either affect or are affected by that slicing criterion and thereby reduces the search space to find influences within execution traces Unfortunately the resulting dynamic slices are still often prohibitively large for many uses Despite this reduction search space the dynamic slices are often still prohibitively large for many uses and moreover are provided without guidance of which and to what degree those influences are exerted In this work we present a novel approach to quan tify the relevance of each instruction execution event within a dynamic slice by its degree of relative influence on the slicing criterion As such we augment the dynamic slice with dynamic relevance measures for each event in the slice which can be used to guide and prioritize inspection of the events in the slice Palepu Vijay Krishna and Jones James Discriminating Influences among Instructions in a Dynamic Slice 2 14 29th IEEE ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ASE to appear 15 19 September 2 14 paper slides Dynamic Dependence Summaries Modern applications make heavy use of third party libraries and components which poses new challenges for efficient dynamic analysis To perform such analyses transitive dependent components at all layers of the call stack must be monitored and analyzed and as such may be prohibitively expensive for systems with large libraries and components As an approach to address such expenses we record summarize and reuse dynamic dataflows between inputs and outputs of components based on dynamic control and data traces These summarized dataflows are computed at a fine grained instruction level the result of which we call dynamic dependence summaries Although static summaries have been proposed to the best of our knowledge this work presents the first technique for dynamic dependence summaries The benefits to efficiency of such summarization may be afforded with losses of accuracy As such we evaluate the degree of accuracy loss and the degree of efficiency gain when using dynamic dependence summaries of library methods On five large programs from the DaCapo benchmark for which no existing whole program dynamic dependence analyses have been shown to scale and 21 versions of NANOXML the summarized dependence analysis provided 9 accuracy and a speed up of 1 i e 2 on average when compared to traditional exhaustive dynamic dependence analysis Palepu Vijay Krishna Xu Guoqing and Jones James Improving Efficiency of Dynamic Analysis with Dynamic Dependence Summaries 2

visualization THE BRAIN that reveals clusters of source code that co execute to produce behavioral features of the program throughout and within executions We created a clustered visualization of source code that is informed by dynamic control flow of multiple executions each cluster represents commonly interacting logic that composes software features In addition we render individual executions atop the clustered multiple execution visualization as user controlled animations to reveal characteristics of specific executions these animations may provide exemplars for the clustered features and provide chronology for those behavioral features or they may reveal anomalous behaviors that do not fit with the overall operational profile of most executions Both the clustered multiple execution view and the animated individual execution view provide insights for the constituent behaviors within executions that compose behaviors of whole executions Inspired by neural imaging of human brains of people who were subjected to various external stimuli we designed and implemented THE BRAIN to reveal program activity during execution The result has revealed the principal behaviors of execution and those behaviors were revealed to be in some cases cohesive modular source code structures and in other cases cross cutting emergent behaviors that involve multiple modules In this
