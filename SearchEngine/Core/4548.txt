organization that focuses on the benefits and risks to society of computer technology offers the following answers to frequently asked questions about computer based voting technology Q Why do vote counting systems produce different totals when the ballots are recounted Shouldn t machine counts and recounts of ballots produce repeatable reliable results A Many people have wondered why a computerized vote counting system would have any significant inaccuracies Some have publicly speculated that such variation must be the result of deliberate human action Some people believe that computerized counts will always be more accurate than human counts because of inevitable human error However computerized vote counting systems are complex prone to several kinds of error Well designed vote counting systems minimize these errors Some systems particularly older systems are not so well designed and are more prone to error To illustrate this problem we will describe some reliability problems with the oldest type of computerized ballot still in use the Vote O Matic tm This system was once very popular and is still used in many places including 15 Florida counties Broward Collier Dade Duval Highlands Hillsborough Indian River Lee Marion Osceola Palm Beach Pasco Pinellas Sarasota and Sumpter The following describes reliability problems associated with one phase of the elections process gathering ballots and running them through readers Problems may occur in other phases included materials design and printing polling place administration voter education and vote tally software By focusing on this one phase we do not imply that the other phases are trivial Conducting elections is demanding work in all phases Also this paper focuses on errors Elections frauds certainly have arisen in the history of American politics but to our knowledge no fraud has been alleged in the ballot counting process for this election Some level of error is inevitable when counting Vote O Matic ballots however CPSR has been studying Vote O Matic type vote counting systems for over ten years Experts including CPSR s own project personnel have concluded that the Vote O Matic system has inherent accuracy limitations Furthermore careful manual counting of Vote O Matic ballots should always be more accurate than machine counts The Vote O Matic system uses as a ballot the Hollerith punch card also known as a computer card This once common card is roughly 3 by 7 with small rectangular holes For Vote O Matic cards each hole in the card represents a vote for one candidate or in favor or against a ballot measure The ballot is counted by feeding it short side first into a reader The card is made with one corner clipped so that the correct end of the card is fed in first The reader has lights and sensors When a hole passes over the sensor light shines through and the hole is read as a vote Hollerith cards were used for the 189 census and millions and millions of critical activities between then and the 197 s Thus one might expect the Vote O Matic system to be extremely reliable But important differences between the standard Hollerith card and the Vote O Matic card make the Vote O Matic far less stable and reliable There are three main problem areas ballots ballot reader machines what happens when a ballot reader reads a ballot Ballots The ballots use essentially the same card size and hole positions that IBM adopted in 1924 soon after they bought Hollerith s company However the cards are not the same Hollerith s approach was to punch a hole in a solid piece of paper Vote O Matic cards are pre punched Each square chad is held in place by a small wad of paper fibers at each corner The vote then makes a hole by pushing the chad out with a round stylus However sometimes a chad will be partly punched out or will snag on something and be pulled out creating what is known as hanging chad Hanging chad can be attached at one two or three corners Chad attached at one corner are usually torn off by the card reader or in handling Chad attached at two corners are also often torn off unless the two corners are on the side of the chad that is fed first into the card reader Then often the chad will be forced back into the hole only to flap open again later chad attached at three corners are also usually forced closed by the card reader Handling the cards can also change the status of hanging chad Some studies have been done on chad but there are many independent variable and complicating situations so the preceding is a generalization These pre punched cards are also reportedly sensitive to changes humidity The reasons have not to our knowledge been studied but it is likely because the chad loses and gains moisture faster than the bulk material Thus taking a box of Vote O Matic cards from an air conditioned room to a humid evening to another air conditioned room will have unpredictable effects It may take the cards some time to settle down after the ordeal The pre punches also make the cards less rigid than a normal Hollerith card and thus more prone to bending Bent cards often cause problems during reading The trailing edge of the card is uneven because of tabs from where the write in tab was detached The faces of the card are not as smooth as a regular card again due to the pre punches Ballot Reader Machines So far as we know there are no longer any manufacturers of Hollerith card readers High speed card readers have a lot of precision parts Existing readers must be periodically rebuilt but many companies no longer exist and the remaining manufacturers so far as we know no longer offer maintenance contracts on the units Elections is about the last market left for Hollerith card readers Elections companies buy up equipment from counties as they move away from Vote O Matic systems and sell it jurisdictions still using Vote O Matic Elections aren t a particularly hard life for a card reader since a reader is only used for a few days a year Still the readers eventually need to be rebuilt which elections companies do with a dwindling supply of spares hangar queens and whatever rebuild protocols they devise Still some parts age more on calendar time than with use As the readers age they become less reliable and more prone to error and breakdown What Happens When a Ballot Reader Reads a Ballot Ideally a stack of ballots is sucked one at a time from the input hopper to the output hopper of a card reader each being counted accurately However sometimes two cards are sucked through This is probably because pre punching makes small ridges on the bottom of the card and an identical pattern of small troughs on the top The ridges tend to get caught in the troughs Also feed mechanisms have to be engineered with consideration of the air cushion between the cards as one moves relative to the other This air cushion will not have the same properties for Vote O Matic cards as for normal cards due to surface roughness For whatever reason misfeeds happen Hanging chad can flip open and closed Detached chad can become stuck in the feed path increasing double feeds and misfeeds Detached chad can jam two cards together increasing misfeeds In some machines detached chad can jam over the light or sensor causing holes to not be read until the chad blows out of the way Detached chad can migrate from one card to the next Chad that was not detached before but merely buckled or only detached on one corner which counts as not an open hole in many jurisdictions can catch on other cards and become hanging chad or be torn loose The read process can be quite traumatic to a Vote O Matic card Q Is counting ballots by hand more or less reliable than counting them by machine A A human count of Vote O Matic cards should almost always produce a significantly more accurate result than automated reading People cannot count cards as quickly as a card reader but a card reader is much more limited than a person in how it can handle and read a card Any damage a card has sustained can confuse a card reader or cause it to malfunction People are better able to deal with such problems Unfortunately reading a Vote O Matic card by machine changes the card Cards that have had one or more trips through a high speed card reader will appear different to a human reader than they would have when freshly punched by the voter Erik Nilsson an election technology analyst for CPSR believes that the Vote O Matic system should be replaced For a quarter century election experts have been calling for the Vote O Matic system to be retired The results of the 2 election show that it is now time move beyond this temperamental antique Q Would Internet voting solve this problem A Internet voting is often suggested as a solution to election counting problems but has many problems of its own for example If people voted from home it would be very difficult perhaps impossible to assure that those who vote are who they say they are Someone could vote for one of their family members for example If people vote from home rather than in a polling place vote secrecy and privacy could be compromised Elections in many democratic societies including the U S are based on the promise of secret ballots where only the voter knows who he or she voted for unless he or she chooses to tell others A home based Internet based voting system would favor people who have computers and Internet connections at home Such amenities are not possessed by all citizens in the U S Purely electronic ballots leave no paper trail so electronic subversion of voting records could be difficult or impossible to detect Voting from home could destroy the sense of shared civic responsibility and pride that most people clearly feel when they go to an actual polling place to vote On the other hand Internet voting could offer the following advantages Customized presentation of voting choices for example voter selected font size Reliable vote tabulation Access for the disabled and rural Can handle large numbers of voters Computers of course can and will be used in elections One approach that could provide the advantages without many of the disadvantages would be to provide Internet terminals in polling places Voters would come to the polling place and identify themselves as they always have Vote O Matic and other outdated unreliable systems would be replaced by more current technology Each polling place would have a manual backup system on site for when the network connections or computers fail as they surely will or when a voter is simply unable to understand how to use the computer A home based Internet voting system is completely out of the question until access to the Internet in the U S is universal Until such a time adopting a home based Internet voting system would be unconstitutional Today we are far from universal access For example in some urban poor districts 14 of households lack even basic phone service much less Internet connections On some Indian reservations the percentage of phone less households is even higher 4 Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility was founded in the early 198 s by computer scientists and engineers who were concerned about the use of computer technology in military applications particularly the Strategic Defense or Star Wars Initiative In the mid 198 s the organization branched out to include other issues such as electronic privacy freedom of speech and the use of computer technology in elections For further information please visit CPSR s

Shouldn't machine counts and recounts\r\nof ballots produce repeatable, reliable results?</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">A: Many people have wondered why a computerized\r\nvote-counting system</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">would have any significant inaccuracies. Some\r\nhave publicly speculated that such variation must be the result of deliberate\r\nhuman action. Some people believe that computerized counts will always\r\nbe more accurate than human counts, because of inevitable \"human error.\"</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">However, computerized vote-counting systems\r\nare complex, prone to</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">several kinds of error. Well-designed vote-counting\r\nsystems minimize these errors. Some systems, particularly older systems,\r\nare not so well-designed,and are more prone to error. To illustrate this\r\nproblem, we will describe some reliability problems with the oldest type\r\nof computerized ballot still in use, the Vote-O-Matic(tm). This system\r\nwas once very popular and is still used in many places, including 15 Florida\r\ncounties: Broward, Collier, Dade, Duval, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian\r\nRiver, Lee, Marion, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, and\r\nSumpter.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The following describes reliability problems\r\nassociated with one phase of the elections process: gathering ballots and\r\nrunning them through readers. Problems may occur in other phases, included\r\nmaterials design and printing, polling place administration, voter education,\r\nand vote tally software. By focusing on this one phase, we do not imply\r\nthat the other phases are trivial. Conducting elections is demanding work,\r\nin all phases. Also, this paper focuses on errors. Elections frauds certainly\r\nhave arisen in the history of American politics, but to our knowledge no\r\nfraud has been alleged in the ballot counting process for this election.\r\nSome level of error is inevitable when counting Vote-O-Matic ballots, however.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">CPSR has been studying Vote-O-Matic-type vote\r\ncounting systems for over ten years. Experts, including CPSR's own project\r\npersonnel, have concluded that the Vote-O-Matic system has inherent accuracy\r\nlimitations. Furthermore,careful manual counting of Vote-O-Matic ballots\r\nshould always be more accurate than machine counts.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The Vote-O-Matic system uses as a ballot the\r\nHollerith punch card, also known as a \"computer card.\" This once-common\r\ncard is roughly 3\" by 7\", with small rectangular holes. For Vote-O-Matic\r\ncards, each hole in the card represents a vote for one candidate (or in\r\nfavor or against a ballot measure). The ballot is counted by feeding it,\r\nshort-side first, into a reader. (The card is made with one corner clipped,\r\nso that the correct end of the card is fed in first.) The reader has lights\r\nand sensors. When a hole passes over the sensor, light shines through,\r\nand the hole is read as a vote.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Hollerith cards were used for the 1890 census,\r\nand millions and millions of critical activities between then and the 1970's.\r\nThus, one might expect the Vote-O-Matic system to be extremely reliable.\r\nBut important differences between the standard Hollerith card and the Vote-O-Matic\r\ncard make the Vote-O-Matic far less stable and reliable. There are three\r\nmain problem areas:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- ballots</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- ballot reader machines</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- what happens when a ballot reader reads a\r\nballot</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">* Ballots</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The ballots use essentially the same card size\r\nand hole positions that IBM adopted in 1924 soon after they bought Hollerith's\r\ncompany. However, the cards are not the same. Hollerith's approach was\r\nto punch a hole in a solid piece of paper. Vote-O-Matic cards are pre-punched.\r\nEach square \"chad\" is held in place by a small wad of paper fibers at each\r\ncorner. The vote then makes a hole by pushing the chad out with a round\r\nstylus. However, sometimes a chad will be partly punched out or will snag\r\non something and be pulled out, creating what is known as \"hanging chad.\"</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Hanging chad can be attached at one, two, or\r\nthree corners. Chad attached at one corner are usually torn off by the\r\ncard reader or in handling. Chad attached at two corners are also often\r\ntorn off, unless the two corners are on the side of the chad that is fed\r\nfirst into the card reader. Then, often,the chad will be forced back into\r\nthe hole, only to flap open again later. chad attached at three corners\r\nare also usually forced closed by the card reader. Handling the cards can\r\nalso change the status of hanging chad. Some studies have been done on\r\nchad, but there are many independent variable and complicating situations,\r\nso the preceding is a generalization.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">These pre-punched cards are also reportedly\r\nsensitive to changes humidity. The reasons have not, to our knowledge,\r\nbeen studied, but it is likely because the chad loses and gains moisture\r\nfaster than the bulk material. Thus taking a box of Vote-O-Matic cards\r\nfrom an air-conditioned room to a humid evening to another air-conditioned\r\nroom will have unpredictable effects. It may take the cards some time to\r\nsettle down after the ordeal.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The pre-punches also make the cards less rigid\r\nthan a normal Hollerith card,and thus more prone to bending. Bent cards\r\noften cause problems during reading. The trailing edge of the card is uneven,\r\nbecause of tabs from where the write-in tab was detached. The faces of\r\nthe card are not as smooth as a regular card, again due to the pre-punches.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">&nbsp;</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">* Ballot Reader Machines</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">So far as we know, there are no longer any\r\nmanufacturers of Hollerith card readers. High-speed card readers have a\r\nlot of precision parts. Existing readers must be periodically rebuilt,\r\nbut many companies no longer exist and the remaining manufacturers, so\r\nfar as we know, no longer offer maintenance contracts on the units. Elections\r\nis about the last market left for Hollerith card readers. Elections companies\r\nbuy up equipment from counties as they move away from Vote-O-Matic systems,\r\nand sell it jurisdictions still using Vote-O-Matic.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Elections aren't a particularly hard life for\r\na card reader, since a reader is only used for a few days a year. Still,\r\nthe readers eventually need to be rebuilt, which elections companies do\r\nwith a dwindling supply of spares,hangar queens, and whatever rebuild protocols\r\nthey devise. Still, some parts age more on calendar time than with use.\r\nAs the readers age, they become less reliable and more prone to error and\r\nbreakdown.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">&nbsp;</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">* What Happens When a Ballot Reader Reads a\r\nBallot</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Ideally, a stack of ballots is sucked one-at-a-time\r\nfrom the input hopper to the output hopper of a card reader, each being\r\ncounted accurately.

The ridges\r\ntend to get caught in the troughs. Also, feed mechanisms have to be engineered\r\nwith consideration of the air cushion between the cards, as one moves relative\r\nto the other.

Elections\r\nin many democratic societies, including the U.S., are based on the promise\r\nof secret ballots, where only the voter knows who he or she voted for (unless\r\nhe or she chooses to tell others).</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- A home-based Internet-based voting system\r\nwould favor people who have computers and Internet connections at home.\r\nSuch amenities are not possessed by all citizens in the U.S.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Purely electronic ballots leave no paper\r\ntrail, so electronic subversion of voting records could be difficult or\r\nimpossible to detect.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Voting from home could destroy the sense\r\nof shared civic responsibility and pride that most people clearly feel\r\nwhen they go to an actual polling place to vote.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">On the other hand, Internet voting could offer\r\nthe following advantages:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Customized presentation of voting choices,\r\nfor example voter-selected font size</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Reliable vote tabulation</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Access for the disabled, and rural</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Can handle large numbers of voters</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Computers, of course, can and will be used\r\nin elections. One approach that could provide the advantages without many\r\nof the disadvantages would be to provide Internet terminals in polling\r\nplaces. Voters would come to the polling place and identify themselves,\r\nas they always have. Vote-O-Matic and other outdated, unreliable systems\r\nwould be replaced by more current technology. Each polling place would\r\nhave a \"manual\" backup system on site, for when the network connections\r\nor computers fail (as they surely will) or when a voter is simply unable\r\nto understand how to use the computer.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">A home-based Internet voting system is completely\r\nout of the question until access to the Internet in the U.S. is universal.\r\nUntil such a time, adopting a home-based Internet voting system would be\r\nunconstitutional. Today we are far from universal access. For example,\r\nin some urban poor districts, 14% of households lack even basic phone service,\r\nmuch less Internet connections. On some Indian reservations, the percentage\r\nof phone-less households is even higher: 40%.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility\r\nwas founded in the early 1980s by computer scientists and engineers who\r\nwere concerned about the use of computer technology in military applications,\r\nparticularly the Strategic Defense, or \"Star Wars\", Initiative. In the\r\nmid-1980s, the organization branched out to include other issues, such\r\nas electronic privacy, freedom of speech, and the use of computer technology\r\nin elections.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">For further information, please visit CPSR's\r\nwebsite:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><U><FONT COLOR=\"#0000FF\">http://www.cpsr.org/issues/voting.html</FONT></U>\r\nor contact the CPSR office</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">at 650-322-3778 or cpsr@cpsr.org to be directed\r\nto experts in the area of Internet voting.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Susan Evoy * Managing Director</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><U><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><FONT COLOR=\"#0000FF\">http://www.cpsr.org/</FONT></FONT></U>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">P.O.
