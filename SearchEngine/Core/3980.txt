Empirical results show that GLOREAL is 4-5% more\naccurate than C4.5 on the average. GLOREAL's success is due in part\nto learning and aggregating multiple classifiers for a problem,\nwhich is more effective in GLOREAL than it is in bagging decision\ntrees. Another important factor in GLOREAL's success is that it has\na richer and more effective representation language than ordinary\ndecision tree learners, particularly with regard to numeric\nattributes.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3980.0}
