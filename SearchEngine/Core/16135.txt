feel free to post my message to you or to modify it as you see fit David Langsam is recorded in the Langsam Spira family document on page H 7 under what appears to be section H8 2 It shows that he was

Bruce 1969 and Michael Jacob known as Jacob 1971 I was told when I grew up that my grandfather David Langsam came to this country to escape the Austrian army after being impressed as part of a campaign by the army to separate young Jewish men from their family and thus their culture and religion I was also told that he was from Galicia In looking at a historical atlas it appears that the Austro Hungarian empire did extend into or at least near to Galicia so all this does look authentic to me I see on page H 8 of the Langsam Spira document that you are aware of Perline Langsam and Sigmond Langsam both of whom live in the St Louis area Perline can be contacted at 2 7 Ambridge Court Chesterfield MO 63 17 Her phone is 314 576 5311 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need
