We characterize\narea-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and\ndiscuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal\nlayouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of\nall layouts of a given dual graph.\n<p>\nMerged with\n\"<a href=\"p-orientation-constrained\">Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts</a>\"\nto form the journal version, \"<a href=\"p-aucrl.html\">Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts</a>\".\n<p>\n(<a href=\"EppMumSpe-SCG-09-slides.pdf\">SoCG talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts</b>.<br>\nD.

We define a variant of\nconfluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path\nbetween two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.\nWe show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,\nin contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.\nAdditionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points\nare on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed\ncyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.\nWe use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which\nall tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"auth.html\">Co-authors</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
