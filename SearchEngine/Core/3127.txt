To the right is a picture of Annie and I during the summer of 2002 at a friend's birthday party.  I still look pretty much the same.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, I have been contacted by people who seek my advice on whether or not they would be accepted to various universities and what kinds of funding they could expect.  If I don't know you and you are planning on doing this; don't.  Do like everyone else does and read your prospective program's site, and if that is not sufficient; ask their graduate admissions person for the contact information of a student who would be willing to give their advice.  Emailing random graduate students is basically spamming, especially when you are emailing someone in a different group from what you are interested in.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few e-mail addresses one could use.  Please choose only one, as all of them are checked every 20 minutes.<br><br>\r\n\r\njosiah.carlson&#064;gmail.com<br>\r\njcarlson&#064;nerp.net<br>\r\njosiahcarlson&#064;yahoo.com<br>\r\njosiah_carlson&#064;hotmail.com<br>\r\n1574593&#064;pager.mirabilis.com<br><br>\r\n\r\nSome older email addresses (that may or may not work in the coming months or years):\r\njcarlson&#064;uci.edu<br>\r\njcarlson&#064;ics.uci.edu<br>\r\njcarlson&#064;isd.net<br>\r\n\r\nIf you hadn't noticed, my ICQ number is 1574593.  I do have IDs for the other major chat networks (Yahoo and MSN being obvious, AIM being the same as the Yahoo, only without the @yahoo.com), and used to keep a copy of <a href=\"http://www.trillian.cc\">Trillian</a> open at all times just in case, but no one has really chatted with me in months, so I stopped logging in.<br><br>\r\n\r\nReally though, my email checks itself quit often.
