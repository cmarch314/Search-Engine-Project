This brings forth a new technique, prune and\n   search, and a new data structure, the clipped tree.\n   These are used to improve the space bounds on previously best known\n   algorithms.\n   <p>\n   This paper appeared in <i>Journal of Algorithms</i>\n   <b>49</b>:1 (October 2003), pp.&nbsp;13-41.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 1610.0}
