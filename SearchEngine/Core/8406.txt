In this paper, we present\r\na new definition of local consistency, called relational consistency. The\r\nnew definition is relation-based, in contrast with the previous definition of\r\nlocal consistency, which we characterize as variable-based. We show the\r\nconceptual power of the new definition by showing how it unifies known\r\nelimination operators such as resolution in theorem proving, joins in relational \r\ndatabases, and variable elimination for solving linear inequalities.\r\nAlgorithms for enforcing various levels of relational consistency are \r\nintroduced and analyzed. We also show the usefulness of the new definition\r\nin characterizing relationships between properties of constraint networks and \r\nthe level of local consistency needed to ensure global consistency.</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r41-local-global-rel-consistency.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r41-local-global-rel-consistency.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8406.0}
