Many systems deployed today lack\nperformance isolation and experience contention, slowdown, and\noutages caused by aggressive workloads or by improperly throttled\nmaintenance tasks such as data replication.\n\n<p>\nIn this talk we present Retro, a resource management framework for\nshared distributed systems.  Retro monitors per-tenant resource\nusage both within and across distributed systems, and exposes this\ninformation to centralized resource management policies through a\nhigh-level API.  A policy can shape the resources consumed by a\ntenant using distributed control points, which enforce sharing and\nrate-limiting decisions.\n\n<p>\nWe demonstrate how it is feasible to cheaply compromise the performance\nof target tenants, and how one can use Retro to write policies providing\nfairness, and latency guarantees to high-priority tenants. We evaluate the\nsystem on a Hadoop stack comprising HBase, Yarn, MapReduce, HDFS, and\nZookeeper.  Our\nevaluation shows that Retro has low overhead, and achieves the\npolicies' goals, accurately detecting contended resources,\nthrottling tenants responsible for slowdown and overload, and fairly\ndistributing the remaining cluster capacity.\n\n<p>\nBio:\nRodrigo Fonseca is an assistant professor at Brown University's Computer\nScience Department. He holds a PhD from UC Berkeley, and prior to Brown was a\nvisiting researcher at Yahoo! Research. He is broadly interested in\nnetworking,\ndistributed systems, and operating systems.  His research involves seeking\nbetter ways to build, operate, and diagnose distributed systems, including\nlarge-scale internet systems, cloud computing, and mobile computing. He is\ncurrently working on dynamic tracing infrastructures for these systems, on\nnew ways\nto leverage network programmability, and on better ways to manage energy\nusage in mobile devices.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4869.0}
