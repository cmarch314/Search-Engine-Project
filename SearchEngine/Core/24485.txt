{"text": "Overview ICS 46 Data Structure Analysis and Implementation Introduction This lecture will overview four topics related to this course Learning what material will we cover in ICS 46 Computing Human Resources what resources are available and how we will learn to use them Perspectives on Programming a short discussion of programming and education built around Quotes that I have collected on my web page there are hundreds there Software Production This is some big picture material that I lecture my introductory programming students on In case you are interested I ve included it here Especially interesting is the table on Software Project Metrics Course Goals Background I expect students entering ICS 46 to have a good knowledge of programming in general and programming in C in particular I expect that they have used some kind of Integrated Development Environment IDE to write run and debug code Most students enrolling in this course are sophomores or transfer students who have taken a year of programming in Java or Python and a quarter of programming in C either in ICS 45C or ICS 65 or equivalent here at UCI or at a Community College C is a large programming language and I am not sure what features you were taught and more importantly what features you have mastered This quarter you will likely use most of the C features that you have learned and more If I use a language feature that you are not familiar with please bring it to my attention so that we can discuss it whether in class or even better on a MessageBoard in the course Forum see more about the course Forum below The first two programming assignments are foundational the next four cover new material that we will learn this quarter Programming Assignment will quickly bring you up to speed on using Eclipse C the course library containing a similar but simplified version of the Standard Template Library called the ICS46 Template Library ITL and the GoogleTest library for unit testing code Programming Assignment 1 will explore how to use the ITL to solve a variety of complicated programs elegantly Programming Assignments 2 5 augment the ITL with more efficient implementations of the template classes and extensions to the template classes based on the data structure material that we will cover this quarter Central to all these assignments will be the use and implementation of iterators During most of these assignments you will use the GoogleTest library to run unit tests on your code to help you test and debug it New Material We will study three major topics each of which is multifaceted students should also acquire fluency in thinking about discussing and writing programs in C using appropriate features Demonstrate skill solving problems programming with the ITL classes specifically understand the operations that we can perform on the abstract data types Stack Queue PriorityQueue Set Map EquivalenceClass and Graph including using their iterators and use combinations of these data types and their operations to solve complicated problems We call these software components data TYPES or ABSTRACT data TYPES because they are characterized completely by their external behavior E g in queues we know that if C executes q enqueue a followed by q enqueue b and q enqueue c then calling q dequeue will returrn a and leave only b first and c second and last in the queue no matter how such a queue is actually implemented in C e g by an array or linked list Likewise in stacks we know that if C executes s push a followed by s push b and s push c then calling s pop will returrn c and leave only b at the top and a at the bottom in the stack no matter how such a stack is actually implemented in C So data types have external behavior that must be captured exhibitted by any data structure used to implement a data type For templated classes we use the declaration part of hpp files to define abstract classes containing pure virtual methods in C to specify the operations available for a data type Demonstrate skill using low level C data structures primarily arrays and self referential data structures e g lists and trees to implement these data types correctly how the information is represented and what algorithms process the information and ensure that they run efficiently There are many different data STRUCTURES that we can use to implement every data TYPE E g there are various implementations of queues that use arrays and linked list data structures that correctly reproduce queue behavior Each has different advantages and disadvantages over the other see 3 below for an important category of differences I will provide slow implementations for all these data types which use simple array data structures to implement their behavior Using these simple implementations we can write programs using these data types that execute correctly if slowly During the quarter we will discuss more interesting data structures and use them to reimplement these data types more efficiently By substituting a faster implementation for a data type using just a few edits in our code our programs will produce the same results exhibit the same external behavior but run more quickly For templated classes we use the definition part of hpp files to define concrete classes in C to specify how the operations on a data type are implemented using the data structure implementing it These classes typically inherit from an abstract class and concretely define all their pure virtual methods They also define a nested class definition for iterators Understand O big oh and big omega and big Theta notation and demonstrate the ability to use these notations to analyze the efficiency of implementations of template classes and understand the appropriate usefulness and limits of these notations and contrast and augment them by collecting empirical data Since all data structures that implement a data type exhibit the same external behavior their primary difference is how fast their operations run and to a lesser extent how much memory they occupy We will use mathematical and empirical approaches to study the efficency of the algorithms that run on various data structures In pursuit of goals 1 2 we will gain experience using intermediate level C programming ideas abstract classes virtual functions inheritance recursion hashing caching the decorator pattern etc Expectations for Learning As members of a course working together in teaching and learning we should share the following expectations Instructor Starts and stops class on time Assigns the minimal amount of homework but enough so that students learn all the required material ICS 46 is a 4 unit course typically each unit requires 3 hours of work each week This means your time working on ICS 46 should occupy about 12 hours every week Of this 12 hours about 3 hours will be in class lecture so the other 9 will correspond to reading course material working on quizzes and working on programming assignments in and outside of lab A full time student typically takes 12 16 units quarter which translates into 36 48 hours of work each week Distributes course materials in a timely manner Returns solutions graded homework promptly Is available for providing individual help Student Attends class is punctual and participates Completes all homework spending the requisite time to learn all the required material Studies course materials READ READ READ and is prepared for class Examines solutions graded homework to improve knowledge and rectify misconceptions about the course material and promptly reports any possible grading mistakes Seeks individual help when it is needed The biggest source of problems for students taking ICS 46 is skipping classes not doing readings homework fully and poor time management on programming assignments waiting too long to start them You are scheduled to spend about 12 hours in ICS 46 1 weeks of work at 12 hours week please allow for this much time in your schedule and use this time wisely In Malcolm Galdwell s book Outliers The Story of Success Chapter 2 is titled The 1 Hour Rule it describes how it takes about 5 1 years 8 hours of work a day translates to 2 hours of work per year to master a discipline Your work in this course should bring you 1 2 closer to your goal I believe that with the right attitude and work ethic most UCI students can learn and demonstrate that he she has learned the material required for ICS 46 and pass this course with a good grade Many but not all grades of C and below are the result of a failure to turn in homework consistently Resources Computer Labsand Software I expect that most students will be using their own computers for programming assignments You are encouraged to use your own machine for all aspects of the course that it is capable of supporting You can download all the required course software to your personal computer for free In addition to using their own machines students can do their coursework on the machines in the ICS Labs The main upside of using the ICS labs is that it will be easy to get ICS 46 staff to help you there the main downside is that you will not be using your own computer unless you have a portable and bring it to the labs to get the best of both worlds All labs are located in in the ICS building in rooms 183 189 192 and 364 ICS courses often schedule lab hours to complement lecture hours during which students can learn how to use software tools and work on their programming assignments all under the supervision of ICS 46 staff members We will have 1 hours of supervised labs scheduled each week student are not formally scheduled in labs but I expect them to spend at least 4 hours in lab each week The machines in the ICS Labs are Dell Optiplex computers running Windows 7 and all the necessary course software browsers the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment IDE C and all the other course related software These labs provide a convenient space for students to work in pairs on their assignments where the course staff is available to answer questions immediately The World Wide Web WWW I will place all materials for this course on the WWW some are there now others will become available later in the quarter You will also use the web for submitting programs for grading These materials are organized using the following index Here is a brief description of these main entries Fact Sheet A short page providing information about course staff getting help and meeting times this is the default page for the course Announcements A page with messages to the students updated a few times weekly archived with the most current message at the top Email Archive A page with all messages mailed to the course wide email address this class Forums on Message Board A page with links to all the forums created for this class Syllabus A long page providing detailed information about how the course is run print a copy and read it during the first week of the quarter Lecture Schedule Notes A page indexing all lectures and their on line lecture notes and their associated problem sets Programming Assignments A page indexing all programming assignments Weekly Schedule A page listing all readings and homework assignments and their due dates week by week Handouts General A page indexing a variety of handouts related to the course Online Resources A page indexing various useful on line files some meant to be viewed some meant to be downloaded Sample Programs A page indexing various programs students can download examine and run C Language Reference Documentation for the C language C STL cplusplus Documentation for the STL GoogleTest Index of Documentation for GoogleTest Solutions in EEE Drop Box A link to the EEE drop box containing solutions to all the course assignments quizzes exams and programs updated as appropriate Grades zippled cls file A zipped file you can download with all course grades indexed by a unique number constructed from you UCI ID Anonymous Email To INSTRUCTOR A page students use to send the INSTRUCTOR anonymous email when personal email might be awkward Homework Dropoff A page students use to drop off homework mostly weekly programming assignments and in class programming exams During this course you will be constantly reading web pages and sometimes downloading materials from them onto your computer Generally it is critical to become an expert navigating the course web with a browser specifically you should become familiar with the pages used repeated in this course so that you can easily and quickly find all the materials that you need If you run across any missing links please drop me a short e mail so that I can correct them quickly This is especially important at the beginning of the quarter Human Resources Students start ICS 46 with a wide variety of aptitudes and skills At times even the best students run into problems misconceptions mental roadblocks etc It is imperative that you quickly determine that you have a problem and then get it diagnosed and corrected as soon as possible There are many different resources that you can elect to use Instructor From my perspective the best place to get help is from me the biggest problem is that I m typically teaching hundreds of students each quarter Still I have office hours most days these are open office hours no appointment is necessary If you cannot see me during any of these times you can contact me by e mail or contact me during my online office hours M Th and Su TAs The Teaching Assistants will supervise the labs They are there primarily to help you debug your programs and explain gaps or misconception in your knowledge of C Your TA is also responsible for grading your programs so he she is the first person you should see if you have any questions about how your programming assignments were graded The TAs will aid me grading quizzes and exams Lab Tutors Lab Tutors will help the TAs in the labs They are there primarily to help you debug your programs and explain gaps or misconception in your knowledge of C Students I encourage students in my courses to seek out each other if they have questions The student answering the question will benefit as much as the student asking it One beneficial reason to come to UCI is for the interaction with other outstanding students Of course for graded materials there are dos and don ts related to getting help to ensure academic integrity follow these rules The most useful online mechanism for handing questions discussions is EEE s MessageBoard Forums easily reachable from the course web s index These forums allow students to ask questions or start discussions easily as well as supply answers or participate in the discsussion further Initially I have created four forums for ICS 46 C and Eclipse Lecture Material Programming Assignments Quizzes and Exams If the need arises for other forums tell me if you think another would be useful I will create them You can instruct EEE to email you links to any active discussions in the forums In past quarters these forums have seen a tremendous amount of traffic course material has been clarified questions have been asked and answered and many interesting side discussions have ensued But the efficacy depends on your participation I will broadcast information to all the students and staff in ICS 46 using the ICS 46 Email List ics46 F14 classes uci edu All students and staff in the course will automatically receive emails sent to this address and all messages sent via this discussion list will be archived on the Email Archive easily reachable from the course web s index Most student initiated questions discussions should use the forums mentioned above but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the instructor staff and other students about some timely issue e g Checkmate not responding to program submissions Learning when and how to seek help from others is an important skill to acquire one that you will use continually in your professional career For example if you encounter a programming problem that you cannot solve in 5 minutes and see no further steps toward a solution you should be able to explain the problem concisely using all the programming terminology that you have learned to someone else and then understand and apply an informed answer possibly collaborating to reach a solution Instructors TAs and Lab Tutors all have experience handling such questions and are trained to help students learn to become more self sufficient while still answering their questions for example we might tell you a general technique for solving a collection of similar problems instead of just telling you the answer Sometimes this process is a bit frustrating for students seeking help especially if they started the assignment late and are caught in a time bind but ultimately this approach makes them better programmers The appropriate homily is Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day teach a person to fish and you feed them for life Think seriously about using the human resources that UCI provides which includes me our TAs and Lab Tutors and your fellow students just as you would think about using computational resources the former resources are even more important than the latter Knowing when and how to seek help is a strength not a weakness A Bit about Me I hope to get to know you all individually during the quarter Here is some information about me I grew up on the North Shore of Chicago in the town of Wilmette and attended New Trier West High School I was an undergraduate Mathematics major at Carnegie Mellon University CMU from 1972 1975 after which I taught a introductory programming there for a year I went to graduate school in Computer Science at Stanford While there I wrote a book Karel the Robot A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming and its associated software since updated by Mark Stehlik and Jim Roberts at CMU Over the years my book has been revised and extended by Joe Bergin to C C and now Python and it is still used in Colleges and High Schools around the world From 1985 1995 I taught introductory and intermediate programming at the University of Washington in Seattle sending lots of my students to work at Microsoft the times allowed many of them to become millionaires From 1996 2 7 I returned to teach at CMU for the last two years there I served as the Freshman Advisor for incomming Freshman in Computer Science about 15 year In 2 7 I joined the Bren School of Information and Computer Science with a joint appointment in Computer Science and Informatics returning to teach in a public university where my wife was the founding director of UCI s Nursing program During my Freshman year in high school I had a Math teacher named Mr Lill One class during a test my mechanical pencil broke I asked Mr Lill to borrow one of his pencils but he said no I asked him whether I could borrow a friend s pencil but he said no to that too He told me to always come prepared to class and sat me back down at my desk where I failed the test because I was unable to write any answers I had a very low opinion of Mr Lill for a long time for years and I thought about this incident for many years but he taught me an important lesson that stayed with me much longer than the mathematics he taught I hope I don t have to be anyone s Mr Lill but I will assume that roll if necessary there are lots of lessons to be taught at UCI and not all of them concern the content of the course material I have posted this story on my course web pages for many many years Amazingly in 2 9 when I was attending a reception for students admitted to ICS at UCI I started talking with a student and his parents Offhandedly I asked where the father grew up it was near me I asked what high school he went to it was mine I asked what year he started it was the same year that I started At that point we exchanged names and recognized each other we were not close friends in High School and had not seen each other since graduation The absolute first comment he made to me was Do you remember the day in Mr Lill s class when he wouldn t let you borrow the pencil I was totally floored Obviously the lesson that I learned so painfully that day was also learned by many others but at a lesser cost As a senior in High School I wanted to take both AP Chemistry and AP Physics but they were scheduled at the same time I had great respect for and enjoyed being in the classroom with the Chemistry teacher Mr Kunz so I signed up for AP Chemistry I asked the AP Physics teacher for a list of all the problems that he assigned from the textbook and spent the year reading the book and working those problems the book had answers but not worked solutions for many of those problem in the back The result was that I discovered that I could learn myself from what are now considered very rudimentary learning materials A big goal of college is to teach students to be able to learn by themselves Student Feedback The most interesting short comment that I received on a Faculty Course Evaluation form FCE was You teach a biased class After some reflection I had to agree with that student 1 Almost everything I do in my class is highly biased choosing which programming topics to teach how to sequence these topics which ones to emphasize which ones to relegate to mere details deciding programming assignments and test questions and how to award partial credit for these problems and questions etc You are sitting in my classroom because you have decided to obtain the UCI bias on how to learn programming I once read a book written about MIT The author observed that everyone there majored in the same thing MIT Yes they all learned a different vocabulary and facts and practiced reasoning and problem solving in different disciplines but what everyone really was doing there was learning to think like an MIT graduate Along these lines I want you to eventually acquire a Pattis simulator in your head By running it you can determine how I would approach a problem how I would critique a solution etc You don t have to agree with the results it produces but it is there for you to consult The most interesting long comment I received on a course evaluation form was labeled A Relevant Allegory In order to teach someone to boil water he would first spend a day giving the history of pots including size shape and what metals work best The next day he d lecture on the chemical properties of water On day three he d talk about boiled water through the ages That night he d tell people to go home and use boiled water to make spaghetti carbonera But never once would he tell you to put the water in the pot and heat it That s what his programming classes are like completely irrelevant to the task at hand I like this comment because it is witty well written and true although maybe not in the extreme that the author states Teaching students to boil water is great for a high school class but in college we are trying to achieve something deeper we might instead study phase transitions in matter That is we don t just learn particulars drill and practice we learn general theories and in spite of what this student says how to apply them to particular cases I want to teach programming in such a way that when students are exposed to new and novel situations they will be able to use their general knowledge to fall back and analyze the problem figure out what they know and what they need to learn to solve the problem and ultimately synthesize a solution I acknowledge that learning from first principles is tougher than just memorization and that sometimes students feel that the material covered is not applied But I believe that everything that I teach has many concrete applications Learning a Programming Language Learning In this section I d like to work from the general to the specific from education to programming illustrated with various Quotes I have collected on my web page Let s start with three interesting quotes the first from a graduate student at the University of Washington and the second from Jacob Bronowski a distinguished philosopher of science the third from Edward Teller a physicist There is a division in the student population between those who go to college to learn and those who go to college to earn a diploma J Blau letter to the editor Chronicle of Higher Education May 24 2 2 It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin barefoot irreverance to their studies they are not here to worship what is known but to question it J Bronowski I believe in excellence It is a basic need of every human soul All of us can be excellent because fortunately we are exceedingly diverse in our ambitions and talents E Teller You have to decide why you are attending UCI Your choice will have a lot to say about what you do in this class and others Here is a simple question that makes it concrete which of the following students would you rather be Student 1 attends UCI but on graduation day is informed that all records of the student s performance at UCI have been lost in the future UCI will acknowledge that the student attended for four years and graduated with a CS degree but there are no more details to tell Student 2 attends UCI but on graduation day is hit on the head and develops amnesia although UCI shows the student to have graduated with a 4 in CS the student cannot remember any of the material learned through those four years I enjoy teaching because I am constantly challenged by students to think more deeply about what I know Teaching as best I can is my job challenging what you hear to better understand it and question my knowledge of the subject is yours Such challenges make me rethink and revise my opinions more than you might imagine and think about better ways of presenting and explaining complicated material Everyone can excel in Computer Science at UCI different students will gravitate torwards different parts of the field but it is a big field with many connections to other fields and there is room for everyone to be excellent at something Here is joke that illustrates this idea After running a marathon some of the runners were crowded around the finish line A runner who took 6 hours to finished approached one of the winners in the race and said I admire you because you can run so fast In response the winner said I admire you because you can run for so long If you think about it both runners have accomplished something the other hasn t each has a quality the other can admire Just as I question myself a huge part of learning requires students to question themselves and as seen above me as well Learning is more about questions than answers as the following quotes illustrate Good teaching is more a giving of the right questions than a giving of the right answers J Albers A prudent question is one half of wisdom F Bacon Questions are the important thing answers are less important Learning to ask a good question is the heart of intelligence Learning the answer well answers are for students Questions are for thinkers R Schank in The Connosseur s Guide to the Mind The function of genius is not to give new answers but to pose new questions which time and mediocrity can resolve H Trevor Howard When the physics nobel laureate I Rabi was a child his mother would always ask him at the dinner table not what he learned in his classes that day but what interesting questions he asked Neil Postman a famous education technology and media critic tells the following story about the importance of asking the right question Two priests were arguing about whether it was appropriate to pray and smoke at the same time They each resolved to ask the bishop for guidance When they met again each claimed that the bishop supported his position They went on to explore their interactions with the bishop in a bit more detail The first said I asked the bishop whether it was appropriate to smoke while praying and he said that praying is a transcendant activity that should not be debased by smoking The second said I asked the bishop whether it was appropriate to pray while smoking and he said that praying was appropriate at any time I know that everyone enrolled in this course has already learned some programming In fact we will quickly review much of this material during the first few weeks of the quarter Use this time to attain a deeper more integrated understanding of this material as the following quote illustrates The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes M Proust Remember too that teaching and learning are two different but cooperative activities I ll do my best to teach but you need to do your best to learn as well We think too much about effective methods of teaching and not enough about effective methods of learning No matter how good teaching may be each student must take the responsibility for his own education J Carolus S J Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks The teacher can advance learning only by influencing the student to learn H Simon The truth is when all is said and done one does not teach a subject one teaches a student how to learn it Teaching may look like administering a dose but even a dose must be worked on by the body if it is to cure Each individual must cure his or her own ignorance J Barzun Begin Here pp 35 I have learned throughout my life as a composer chiefly through my mistakes and pursuits of false assumptions not my exposure to founts of wisdom and knowledge I Stravinsky Here is an old joke that illustrates this idea One day a mother comes home from work and asks her son What did you do today The son replied I taught our dog how to play the piano The mother incredulous asked Our dog can play the piano to which the son laughed and replied Of course not mom I said that I taught him I didn t say that he learned how Finally don t be afraid to struggle and fail if learning were simple and effortless we d all be a lot smarter I myself have had many failures and I ve learned that if you are not failing a lot you are probably not being as creative as you could be you aren t stretching your imagination J Backus primary inventor of FORTRAN Learning is never done without errors and defeat V Lenin You have to honor failure because failure is just the negative space around success R Nelson in Wired 6 2 4 page 166 Unfortunately the K 12 world we live in doesn t encourages students to try at really hard things and fail Everyone wants to make sure they never fail This attitude is bad for real college level learning Language Let s leave learning behind but not for too long and talk a bit about language This course is meta lingual we will use a language English to learn a language C Some argue as illustrated below that language is what reality and certainly education is primarily about independent of the subject material thoughts are linguistic As a concrete example we will learn lots of technical terms during the first few weeks of the course and then use them repeated as levers to explore and describe advanced C concepts When it comes time to ask questions about the material or questions about debugging a program that you are writing knowing how to ask using these technical terms and understand the answers given in these technical terms makes the process more precise and concise In an important sense this course is concerned not only about doing programming but just as much with how to talk about programs and doing programming That language is an instrument of human reason and not merely a medium for the expression of thought is a truth generally admitted G Boole The real technology behind all our other technologies is language It actually creates the world our consciousness lives in A Codrescu It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is Physics concerns what we say about nature N Bohr Precise language is not the problem Clear language is the problem R Feynman We think only through the medium of words Languages are true analytical methods Algebra which is adapted to its purpose in every species of expression in the most simple most exact and best manner possible is at the same time a language and an analytical method The art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged A Lavoisier Knowledge of a subject means knowledge of the language of that subject which includes not only what its words mean but far more important how its words mean As one learns the language of a subject one is also learning what the subject is It cannot be said often enough that what we call a subject consists mostly if not entirely of its language If you eliminate all the words of a subject you have eliminated the subject Biology is not plants and animals It is language about plants and animals History is not events It is language describing and interpreting events Astronomy is not planets and stars It is a way of talking about planets and stars N Postman Language serves not only to express thought but to make possible thoughts which could not exist without it B Russell The limits of your language are the limits of your world L Wittgenstein Programming Finally let s talk about programming and programming languages Most of the quotes below are lengthy and come from emminent computer scientists or just fantastic programmers who are trying to communicate what programming is about and why it is so fascinating to them The programmer like the poet works only slightly removed from pure thought stuff He builds castles in the air from air creating by exertion of the imagination Few media of creation are so flexible so easy to polish and rework so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures Yet the program construct unlike the poet s words is real in the sense that it moves and works producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself It prints results draws pictures produces sounds moves arms The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time One types the correct incantation on a keyboard and a display screen comes to life showing things that never were nor could be The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect too If one character one pause of the incantation is not strictly in proper form the magic doesn t work Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect and few areas of human activity demand it Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is I think the most difficult part of learning to program F Brooks The Mythical Man Month pages 7 8 It s programming the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist There s an incredible rigorous technical element to it which I like because you have to do very precise thinking On the other hand it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation A Hertzfeld original Mac programmer When I speak about computer programming as an art I am thinking primarily of it as an art form in an aesthetic sense The chief goal of my work as an educator and author is to help people learn how to write beautiful programs My feeling is that when we prepare a program the experience can be just like composing poetry or music Some programs are elegant some are exquisite some are sparkling My claim is that it is possible to write grand programs noble programs truly magnificent ones computer programming is an art because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world because it requires skill and ingenuity and especially because it produces objects of beauty Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and will do it better D Knuth Computer Programming as an Art Turing Award Speech 1974 A good programming language is a conceptual universe for thinking about programming A language that doesn t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing A Perlis A programming language is a system of notation for describing computations A useful programming language must therefore be suited for both description i e for human writers and readers of programs and for computation i e for efficient implementation on computers But human beings and computers are so different that it is difficult to find notational devices that are well suited to the capabilities of both R Tennant Principles of Programming Languages Prentice Hall 1981 Now I like to focus on aethetics because at some level the root of learning in all disciplines is learning their aesthetics learning to separate the beautiful from the ugly Central to this discussion is the dichotomy between complexity and simplicity in programming As is illustrated many times below what makes programming hard is complexity in the tools used and complexity of the final product it is too easy to create overly complicated designs and implementations We must strive to keep everything simple this is where creativity in programming lies Programming is one of many human activities in which simplicity and beauty are bound tightly The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague E Dijkstra in The Humble Programmer his 1972 Turing Award Lecture Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity The geniuses of the computer field on the the other hand are the people with the keenest aesthetic senses the ones who are capable of creating beauty Beauty is decisive at every level the most important interfaces the most important programming languages the winning algorithms are the beautiful ones Good programmers know what is beautiful and bad programmers don t D Gelernter Machine Beauty Basic Books 1998 Great software likewise requires a fanatical devotion to beauty If you look inside good software you find that parts that no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too When it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way It drives me crazy to see code that s badly indented or that uses ugly variable names P Graham in Hackers and Painters pg 29 Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming B Kernighan creator of the C programming language Fools ignore complexity pragmatists suffer it experts avoid it geniuses remove it Simplicity does not precede complexity but follows it A Perlis Computer Science is the first engineering discipline in which the complexity of the objects created is limited solely by the skill of the creator and not by the strength of raw materials B Reid Design and programming are human activities forget that and all is lost B Stroustrup Technical skill is mastery of complexity while creativity is mastery of simplicity E C Zeeman I d like to present the following quote last it will provide an import perpective for many of our discussions about features in the C language and the strictness of the C compiler It fully recognizes the psychological aspect of programming and is directly related to the complexity of the tools that we use when we build complex artifacts Millions for compilers but hardly a penny for understanding human programming language use Now programming languages are obviously symmetrical the computer on one side the human on the other In an appropriate science of computer languages one would expect that half the effort would be on the computer side understanding how to translate the languages into executable form and half on the human side understanding how to design languages that are easy or productive to use Yet we do not even have an enumeration of all the psychologicial functions programing languages serve for the user Of course there is lots of programming language design but it comes from computer scientists And though technical papers on languages contain main appeals to ease of use and learning they patently contain almost no psychologicial evidence nor any appeal to psychological science A Newell and S Card Software System Costs In the early days computers were built by hand which made them expensive They were physcially large consumed huge amount of power were slow and their memories were small so they could run only small programs As a result the cost of developing a working computing system was mostly spent on hardware At present computers are cheaply mass produced they are small consume minimal power are fast and have large memories Now the cost of developing a working computing system is mostly spent on software To deliver new systems cheaply and on time we must focus on improving the production of software When implementing a computer system a 5 improvement in developing software is worth about as much as a 5 improvement in developing hardware because these latter costs are so minimal to start with In his Turing Award lecture The Humble Programmer Edgser Dijkstra a famous Computer Scientist put it as follows As long as there were no machines programming was no problem at all when we had a few weak computers programming became a mild problem and now 1972 that we have gigantic computers programming has become a gigantic problem As the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a thousand society s ambition to apply these new machines grew in proportion and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of tension between the ends and the means The increased power of the hardware together with the perhaps more dramatic increase in its reliability made solutions feasible that the programmer had not dared to dream about a few years before And now a few years later he had to dream about them and even worse he had to transform such dreams into reality It is no wonder that we found ourselves in a software crisis In fact Moore s Law empirical states that computer communication hardware doubles in performance speed memory and halves in resources size cost about every 18 months This exponential law has held for the past 3 years of computing which has seen changes in computing technology by a factor of a million PCs today perform a billion operations per second if Moore s Law continues to hold for another 4 years PCs will be performing a thousand trillion operations per second about as many as the human brain performs with many more logical elements each operating at a much slower than electronic speed A Software Development Model Over the last 3 years the following model called the Iterated Waterfall model has proven itself an important one for developing large software systems direclty applying it to smaller projects is a bit cumbersome but it is often applied in a modified way Each higher phase must finish before a lower phase begins like water falling but there are opportunities to return to earlier phases a problem at a later phase may back up to an earlier one and all phases can be reached again iterated during maintenance A more recent software methodology better adapted for smaller projects that require fewer programmers is called Extreme Programming It shares the idea of incremental development with the iterated waterfall model but reaches these objectives a bit differently In fact maintenance is a curious term to appply to software because unlike cars for example Software has no parts that wear out and need to be replaced Software has no fluids that evaporate and need to be replished So what constitutes software maintenance Fixing errors Improving performance Increasing functionality Writing new code to meet new specifications Redesigning Reimplementing Recoding Rewriting old code to simplify it for future anticipated changes So software has organic features it continues to grow and evolve In fact reliably working software continues to be used a long time The current Air Traffic controller system is decades old there have been a few attempts to design and code a replacement but after billions of dollars little progress has been made many say because the specification keeps changing see the next chart Relative Costs to Fix Errors Review the Iterated Waterfall model of software development The following chart shows the cost to fix an error depending on when the error was discoved during this process Notice that the sooner an error is discovered the less expensive it is to fix When we write C programs we will learn about language features that allow us to detect errors more quickly and thus fix them earlier and save our time which is the biggest cost of taking this course Software Lifetime Costs We have learned that reliably working software continues to be used a long time Therefore the following charts should come as no surprise although it typically does The upshot of this chart is that software must be built initially in such a way that it is easy to maintain because over the lifetime of a product maintenance costs dominate One easy way to remember this chart is that the maintenance cost looks like a Pac Man icon gobbling up the initial cost to build Software Project Sizes Although we will write only small software systems in this course we should still keep the construction of large software systems in mind As we have seen in industry often small software systems grow into large ones Software project sizes are roughly categorized as follows where K means 1 lines of code and M means 1 million lines of code Tiny 1KSmall 1K 1 KMedium 1 K 1 KLarge 1 K 1 MHuge 1M Writing a very large software project is like building a skyscraper in terms of workforce cost and timetable But it is notoriously difficult to predict software costs and schedules compared to the building trades While most construction jobs can be estimated within 1 of time and budget software jobs are lucky to be estimated with 3 Something like 6 of all software projects fail to be completed or deployed many 1 million projects are abandoned with no usable product produced This is known as the software crisis which many attribute to the relative newness of programming as a discipline The area of Software Engineering is young but quickly growing and maturing as software finds its way into everything that we produce Software Project Metrics Although software projects scale many magnitudes in sizes the ones shown below are medium to huge worker productivit rates fall into a much smaller range The following

it all the other metrics would differ only by a factor of 2 Note that Code Lines Month is a bad metric to measure programmer productivity This is because a poor programmer may quickly produce many lines of to do a simple task while a good programmer will carefully write fewer lines of code to accomplish the same task often producing simpler and easier to modify code reproducing the same functionality in fewer lines of code Here are two relevant quotes from my homepage there are lots of other interesting and relevant quotes there We flew down weekly to meet with IBM but they thought the way to measure software was the amount of code we wrote when really the better the software the fewer lines of code W Gates discussing the writing of the original DOS operating system Once the engineers find out that this is how they re being evaluated by how many lines of code per day they are writing they ll revert to cut and past programming to optimize their productivity rating They ll repeat the same code logic in as many places as possible in an effort not to look lazy Long term benefits like maintainability and portability will be sacrificed on account of a poorly chosen metric B Blunden in Cube Farm page 14 But Code Lines is a good metric to measure maintenance cost which we have seen overshadows by a large fact the original cost to build software So the cost of maintaining a program is roughly proportional to its size This leads to an interesting anomoly A programmer may exhibit what appears to be negative productivity by working to shrink the size of a program but the result is reduced maintanence cost over the lifetime of the software Problem Set Mastering programming starts with mastering the syntax form and semantics meaning of a programming language Before we begin our study of computer languages we can investigate these topics in a natural language Although these are not questions about programming answering them requires thinking like a programmer

<b>Background</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI expect students entering ICS-46 to have a good knowledge of programming in\r\n  general and programming in C++ in particular.\r\nI expect that they have used some kind of Integrated Development Environment\r\n  (IDE) to write, run, and debug code.\r\nMost students enrolling in this course are sophomores (or transfer students),\r\n  who have taken a year of programming in Java or Python and a quarter of\r\n  programming in C++ either in ICS-45C (or ICS-65 or equivalent) here at UCI or\r\n  at a Community College.\r\n<p>\r\nC++ is a large programming language and I am not sure what features you were\r\n  taught and more importantly what features you have mastered.\r\nThis quarter, you will likely use most of the C++ features that you have\r\n  learned and more.\r\nIf I use a language feature that you are not familiar with, please bring it to\r\n  my attention so that we can discuss it (whether in class, or even better on\r\n  a MessageBoard in the course Forum; see more about the course Forum below).\r\n<p>\r\nThe first two programming assignments are foundational; the next four cover\r\n  new material that we will learn this quarter.\r\nProgramming Assignment #0 will quickly bring you up to speed on using\r\n  Eclipse/C++, the course library (containing a similar but simplified version\r\n  of the Standard Template Library: called the ICS46 Template Library: ITL),\r\n  and the GoogleTest library for unit testing code.\r\nProgramming Assignment #1 will explore how to use the ITL to solve a variety of\r\n  complicated programs elegantly.\r\n<p>\r\nProgramming Assignments #2-#5 augment the ITL with more efficient\r\n  implementations of the template classes, and extensions to the template\r\n  classes, based on the data structure material that we will cover this quarter.\r\nCentral to all these assignments will be the use and implementation of\r\n  iterators.\r\nDuring most of these assignments you will use the GoogleTest library to run\r\n  unit tests on your code to help you test and debug it.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- New Material  -->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"NewMaterial\"></a><b>New Material</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nWe will study three major topics, each of which is multifaceted: students\r\n  should also acquire fluency in thinking about,discussing, and writing\r\n  programs in C++ using appropriate features.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Demonstrate skill solving problems/programming with the ITL classes:\r\n       specifically, understand the operations that we can perform\r\n       on the (abstract) data types <i>Stack</i>, <i>Queue</i>,\r\n       <i>PriorityQueue</i>, <i>Set</i>, <i>Map</i>, <i>EquivalenceClass</i>\r\n       and <i>Graph</i> (including using their iterators);\r\n       and use combinations of these data types and their operations to solve\r\n       complicated problems.\r\n<p>\r\n     We call these software components data TYPES or ABSTRACT data TYPES\r\n       because they are characterized completely by their external behavior.\r\n     E.g., in queues we know that if C++ executes <b>q.enqueue(\"a\");</b>\r\n       followed by <b>q.enqueue(\"b\");</b> and <b>q.enqueue(\"c\");</b> then\r\n       calling <b>q.dequeue()</b> will returrn <b>\"a\"</b> and leave only\r\n       <b>\"b\"</b> (first) and <b>\"c\"</b> (second, and last) in the queue, no\r\n       matter how such a queue is actually implemented in C++: e.g., by an\r\n       array or linked list.\r\n<p>\r\n     Likewise, in stacks we know that if C++ executes <b>s.push(\"a\");</b>\r\n       followed by <b>s.push(\"b\");</b> and <b>s.push(\"c\");</b> then calling\r\n       <b>s.pop()</b> will returrn <b>\"c\"</b> and leave only <b>\"b\"</b>\r\n      (at the top) and <b>\"a\"</b> (at the bottom) in the stack,\r\n       no  matter how such a stack is actually implemented in C++.\r\n<p>\r\n     So data types have external behavior that must be captured/exhibitted by\r\n       any data structure used to implement a data type.\r\n     For templated classes, we use the declaration part of <b>.hpp</b> files to\r\n       define abstract classes (containing pure virtual methods) in C++ to\r\n       specify the operations available for a data type.\r\n<p>\r\n<li> Demonstrate skill using low-level C++ data structures (primarily\r\n       arrays and self-referential data structures: e.g., lists and trees) to\r\n       implement these data types correctly (how the information is represented\r\n       and what algorithms process the information) and ensure that they run\r\n       efficiently. \r\n<p>\r\n     There are many different data STRUCTURES that we can use to implement\r\n       every data TYPE.\r\n     E.g., there are various implementations of queues that use arrays and\r\n       linked-list data structures that correctly reproduce queue behavior.\r\n     Each has different advantages and disadvantages over the other \r\n     (see 3 below for an important category of differences). \r\n<p>\r\n     I will provide slow implementations for all these data types, which use \r\n       simple array data structures to implement their behavior.\r\n     Using these simple implementations, we can write programs (using these\r\n       data types) that execute correctly, if slowly.\r\n     During the quarter we will discuss more interesting data structures and\r\n       use them to reimplement these data types more efficiently.\r\n     By substituting a faster implementation for a data type (using just a few\r\n       edits in our code), our programs will produce the same results (exhibit\r\n       the same external behavior) but run more quickly.\r\n<p>\r\n     For templated classes, we use the definition  part of <b>.hpp</b> files to\r\n       define concrete classes in C++ to specify how the operations on a data\r\n       type are implemented using the data structure implementing it.\r\n     These classes typically inherit from an abstract class and concretely\r\n       define all their pure virtual methods.\r\n     They also define a nested class definition for iterators.\r\n<p>\r\n<li> Understand O -big oh (and &Omega; -big omega- and &Theta; -big Theta)\r\n       notation, and demonstrate the ability to use these notations to analyze\r\n       the efficiency of implementations of template classes, and understand\r\n       the appropriate usefulness and limits of these notations (and contrast\r\n       and augment them by collecting empirical data). \r\n<p>\r\n     Since all data structures that implement a data type exhibit the same\r\n     external behavior, their primary difference is how fast their operations\r\n     run (and to a lesser extent, how much memory they occupy). We will use\r\n     mathematical and empirical approaches to study the efficency of the\r\n     algorithms that run on various data structures.\r\n</ol>\r\nIn pursuit of goals 1-2, we will gain experience using\r\n  intermediate-level C++ programming ideas: abstract classes, virtual functions,\r\n  inheritance, recursion, hashing, caching, the decorator pattern, etc. \r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Expectations  -->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"Expectations\"></a><b>Expectations for Learning</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nAs members of a course, working together in teaching and learning, we should\r\n  share the following expectations.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Instructor:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Starts and stops class on time.\r\n  <li>Assigns the minimal amount of homework, but enough so that students learn\r\n        all the required material\r\n        <ul>ICS-46 is a 4 unit course; typically each unit requires 3 hours\r\n              of work each week..\r\n            This means your time working on ICS-46 should occupy about 12\r\n              hours every week.\r\n            Of this 12 hours, about 3 hours will be in-class lecture;\r\n              so the other 9 will correspond to reading course material,\r\n              working on quizzes, and working on programming assignments\r\n              in and outside of lab.\r\n            A full-time student typically takes ~12-16 units/quarter, which\r\n              translates into 36-48 hours of work each week.\r\n        </ul>\r\n  <li>Distributes course materials in a timely manner.\r\n  <li>Returns solutions/graded homework promptly.\r\n  <li>Is available for providing individual help.\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Student:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Attends class, is punctual, and participates.\r\n  <li>Completes all homework, spending the requisite time to learn all the\r\n         required material.\r\n  <li>Studies course materials (READ!

follow these rules.\r\n</ul>\r\nThe most useful online mechanism for handing questions/discussions is EEE's\r\n    <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m15780/\" target=\"main\">\r\n    MessageBoard Forums</a> (easily reachable from the course web's index).\r\nThese forums allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as\r\n  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).\r\nInitially, I have created four forums for ICS-46:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>C++ and Eclipse\r\n<li>Lecture Material\r\n<li>Programming Assignments\r\n<li>Quizzes and Exams\r\n</ol>\r\nIf the need arises for other forums (tell me if you think another would be\r\n  useful), I will create them.\r\nYou can instruct EEE to email you links to any active discussions in the\r\n  forums.\r\nIn past quarters, these forums have seen a tremendous amount of traffic: course\r\n  material has been clarified, questions have been asked and answered, and many\r\n  interesting side-discussions have ensued.\r\nBut the efficacy depends on your participation.\r\n<p>\r\nI will broadcast information to all the students (and staff) in ICS-46\r\n  using the <a href=\"mailto:ics46-F14@classes.uci.edu\">ICS-46 Email List</a>\r\n  (ics46-F14@classes.uci.edu).\r\nAll students and staff in the course will automatically receive emails sent to\r\n  this address and all messages sent via this discussion list will be archived\r\n  on the\r\n    <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/f14/36690/\" target=\"main\">\r\n    Email Archive</a> (easily reachable from the course web's index).\r\nMost student-initiated questions/discussions should use the forums mentioned\r\n  above, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the\r\n  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g.,\r\n  Checkmate not responding to program submissions.\r\n<p>\r\nLearning when and how to seek help from others is an important skill to acquire\r\n  -one that you will use continually in your professional career.\r\nFor example, if you encounter a programming problem that you cannot solve in 5\r\n  minutes (and see no further steps toward a solution), you should be able to\r\n  explain the problem concisely (using all the programming terminology that you\r\n  have learned) to someone else, and then understand and apply an informed\r\n  answer, possibly collaborating to reach a solution.\r\n<p>\r\nInstructors, TAs, and Lab Tutors all have experience handling such questions,\r\n  and are trained to help students learn to become more self-sufficient\r\n  -while still answering their questions: for example, we might tell you a\r\n  general technique for solving a collection of similar problems instead of \r\n just telling you \"the answer\".\r\nSometimes this process is a bit frustrating for students seeking help\r\n  (especially if they started the assignment late and are caught in a\r\n  time-bind), but ultimately this approach makes them better programmers.\r\nThe appropriate homily is, <i>\"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a\r\n  day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for life.\"</i>\r\n<p>\r\nThink seriously about using the human resources that UCI provides (which\r\n  includes me, our TAs,<!--Grader,--> and Lab Tutors, and your fellow\r\n  students), just as you would think about using computational resources:\r\n  the former resources are even more important than the latter.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Knowing when (and how) to seek help is a strength, not a weakness.</b>\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A Bit about Me-->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"Me\"></a><b>A Bit about Me<b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI hope to get to know you all individually during the quarter.\r\nHere is some information about me.\r\n<p>\r\nI grew up on the North Shore of Chicago (in the town of Wilmette) and attended\r\n   New Trier West High School.\r\nI was an undergraduate Mathematics major at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)\r\n  from 1972-1975, after which I taught a introductory programming there for a\r\n  year.\r\nI went to graduate school in Computer Science at Stanford.\r\nWhile there, I wrote a book, <i>Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the\r\n  Art of Programming</i>, and its associated software (since updated by Mark\r\n  Stehlik and Jim Roberts at CMU).\r\nOver the years, my book has been revised and extended by Joe Bergin to C++,\r\n  C++, and now Python, and it is still used in Colleges and High Schools\r\n  around the world.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom 1985-1995 I taught introductory and intermediate programming at the\r\n  University of Washington in Seattle (sending lots of my students to work\r\n  at Microsoft; the times allowed many of them to become millionaires).\r\nFrom 1996-2007 I returned to teach at CMU; for the last two years there,\r\n  I served as the Freshman Advisor for incomming Freshman in Computer\r\n  Science (about 150/year)\r\nIn 2007, I joined the Bren School of Information and Computer Science (with\r\n  a joint appointment in Computer Science and Informatics), returning to teach\r\n  in a public university (where my wife was the founding director of UCI's\r\n  Nursing program).\r\n<p>\r\nDuring my Freshman year in high school, I had a Math teacher named Mr. Lill.\r\nOne class, during a test, my mechanical pencil broke.\r\nI asked Mr. Lill to borrow one of his pencils; but he said no.\r\nI asked him whether I could borrow a friend's pencil; but he said no to that\r\n  too.\r\nHe told me to always come prepared to class, and sat me back down at my desk\r\n  (where I failed the test because I was unable to write any answers).\r\nI had a very low opinion of Mr. Lill for a long time -for years, and I thought\r\n  about this incident for many years; but he taught me an important lesson that\r\n  stayed with me much longer than the mathematics he taught.\r\nI hope I don't have to be anyone's \"Mr. Lill\", but I will assume that roll if\r\n  necessary: there are lots of lessons to be taught at UCI and not all of them\r\n  concern the content of the course material.\r\n<p>\r\nI have posted this story on my course web pages for many many years.\r\nAmazingly, in 2009, when I was attending a reception for students\r\n  admitted to ICS at UCI, I started talking with a student and his parents.\r\nOffhandedly I asked where the father grew up; it was near me; I asked what\r\n  high school he went to; it was mine; I asked what year he started; it was\r\n  the same year that I started!\r\nAt that point we exchanged names, and recognized each other: we were not\r\n  close friends in High School and had not seen each other since graduation.\r\nThe absolute first comment he made to me was, \"Do you remember the day in Mr.\r\n  Lill's class when he wouldn't let you borrow the pencil.\"\r\nI was totally floored.\r\nObviously the lesson that I learned so painfully that day was also learned by\r\n  many others, but at a lesser cost.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a senior in High School I wanted to take both AP Chemistry and AP Physics,\r\n  but they were scheduled at the same time.\r\nI had great respect for and enjoyed being in the classroom with the Chemistry\r\n  teacher, Mr. Kunz, so I signed up for AP Chemistry.\r\nI asked the AP Physics teacher for a list of all the problems that he assigned\r\n  from the textbook, and spent the year reading the book and working those\r\n  problems (the book had answers -but not worked solutions- for many of those\r\n  problem in the back).\r\nThe result was that I discovered that I could learn myself, from what are now\r\n  considered very rudimentary learning materials.\r\nA big goal of college is to teach students to be able to learn by themselves.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"FCE\"></a><b>Student Feedback</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe most interesting short comment that I received on a Faculty/Course\r\n  Evaluation form (FCE) was, \"You teach  a biased class.\"\r\nAfter some reflection, I had to agree with that student 100%.\r\nAlmost everything I do in my class is highly biased: choosing which programming\r\n  topics to teach, how to sequence these topics (which ones to emphasize, which\r\n  ones to relegate to mere details), deciding programming assignments and test\r\n  questions (and how to award (partial) credit for these problems and\r\n  questions), etc.\r\nYou are sitting in my classroom because you have decided to obtain the UCI\r\n  bias on how to learn programming.\r\n<p>\r\nI once read a book written about MIT.\r\nThe author observed that everyone there majored in the same thing: MIT.\r\nYes, they all learned a different vocabulary and facts, and practiced reasoning\r\n   and problem solving in different disciplines, but what everyone really was\r\n   doing there was learning to think like an MIT graduate.\r\nAlong these lines, I want you to eventually acquire a Pattis simulator in\r\n  your head.\r\nBy running it, you can determine how I would approach a problem; how I would\r\n  critique a solution, etc.\r\nYou don't have to agree with the results it produces, but it is there for\r\n  you to consult.\r\n<p>\r\nThe most interesting long comment I received on a course evaluation form was\r\nlabeled <b>A Relevant Allegory</b>:\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\n  \"In order to teach someone to boil water, he would first spend a day giving\r\n     the history of pots, including size, shape, and what metals work best.\r\n   The next day he'd lecture on the chemical properties of water.\r\n   On day three, he'd talk about boiled water through the ages.\r\n   That night, he'd tell people to go home and use boiled water to make\r\n     spaghetti carbonera.\r\n   But never once would he tell you to put the water in the pot and heat it.\r\n   That's what his programming classes are like -completely irrelevant to the\r\n     task at hand.\"\r\n</i>\r\n<p>   \r\nI like this comment because it is witty, well-written, and true -although\r\n  maybe not in the extreme that the author states.\r\nTeaching students to boil water is great for a high school class, but\r\n  in college we are trying to achieve something deeper: we might, instead,\r\n  study phase transitions in matter.\r\nThat is, we don't just learn particulars (drill and practice); we learn\r\n  general theories and -in spite of what this student says- how to apply\r\n  them to particular cases.\r\nI want to teach programming in such a way that when students are exposed to\r\n  new and novel situations, they will be able to use their general knowledge\r\n  to fall back and analyze the problem, figure out what they know and what\r\n  they need to learn to solve the problem, and ultimately synthesize a\r\n  solution.\r\nI acknowledge that learning from first principles is tougher than just\r\n  memorization, and that sometimes students feel that the material covered is\r\n  not \"applied\".\r\nBut, I believe that everything that I teach has many concrete applications.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"LearningProgramming\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<h3>Learning a Programming Language</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Learning Programming  -->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"Learning\"></a><b>Learning</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nIn this section I'd like to work from the general to the specific,\r\n  from education to programming, illustrated with various\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/quotations.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    Quotes</a>\r\n  I have collected on my web page.\r\nLet's start with three interesting quotes: the first from a graduate student\r\n  at the University of Washington, and the second from Jacob Bronowski, a\r\n  distinguished philosopher of science, the third from Edward Teller, a\r\n  physicist.\r\n<p>\r\n<table width =\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" rules=all\">\r\n<tr><td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\r\nThere is a division in the student population between those who go to college\r\n  to learn and those who go to college to earn a diploma. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>- J.
