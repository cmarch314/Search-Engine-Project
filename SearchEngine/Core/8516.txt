In this paper, we\r\ninvestigate the potential of causal independence (CI) for improving this performance.\r\nWe consider several tasks, such as belief updating, finding a most probable \r\nexplanation (MPE), finding a maximum aposteriori hypothesis (MAP), and finding the\r\nmaximum expected utility (MEU). We show that exploiting CI in belief updating can significantly reduce the \r\neffective w*, sometimes down to the induced width of the unmoralized network's graph.\r\nFor example, for poly-trees, CI reduces complexity from exponential to linear in the\r\nfamily size. Similar results hold for the MAP and MEU tasks, while the MPE task\r\nis less sensitive to CI. These enhancements are incorporated into bucket-elimination\r\nalgorithms based on known approaches of network transformations [10, 13] and\r\nelimination [18]. We provide an ordering heuristic which guarantees that exploiting CI\r\nwill never hurt the performance. Finally, we discuss an efficient way of propagating evidence in CI-networks using \r\narc-consistency, and apply this idea to noisy-OR networks. The resulting algorithm \r\ngeneralizes the Quickscore algorithm [9] for BN2O networks.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r67-impact.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r67-impact.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8516.0}
