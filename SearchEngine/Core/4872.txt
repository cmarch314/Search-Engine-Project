You will find that   often the problem gives you more information than you need, or not enough. This   is intentional. Hence, I expect you to struggle with some problems. There   is no one correct answer to many problems. An answer is almost never sufficient   without an explanation.&nbsp; This is particularly true if you want to convince me   that your approach, although it may be different than mine, is reasonable. Any   assumptions you have made should be stated clearly at the top of the solution.   On a small scale, this makes the problems much more representative (than most   textbook problems) of problems you will encounter in real life.</p>\r\n      <p>You are welcome to come ask me questions about how to approach a problem. <BR>\r\n          <BR>\r\n          <strong>Problem sets do not count toward your course grade.
