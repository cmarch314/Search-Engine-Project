Building on this result, we show that\nDominating Set on claw-free graphs is (i) fixed-parameter tractable and\n(ii) even possesses a polynomial kernel. To complement these results, we\nestablish that Dominating Set is not fixed-parameter tractable on the\nslightly larger class of graphs that exclude K<sub>1,4</sub> as an\ninduced subgraph. Our results provide a dichotomy for Dominating Set in\nK<sub>1,L</sub>-free graphs and show that the problem is fixed-parameter\ntractable if and only if L&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3. Finally, we show that our\nalgorithmization can also be used to show that the related Connected\nDominating Set problem is fixed-parameter tractable on claw-free\ngraphs.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Danny Hermelin, Erik Jan van Leeuwen and Gerhard\nWoeginger.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2357.0}
