They present\nand analyze three different classes of algorithms for dealing with the\nproblem. There exist deterministic marking algorithms that are\ncompetitive relative to the size of the cache. They also discuss\nrandomized marking algorithms and the optimal offline algorithm.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3995.0}
