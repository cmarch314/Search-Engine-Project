There seems to\nbe little work in this area from the computational geometry perspective,\nbut there are likely good geometric problems to be found in it.  One\nsuch problem is coping with high-dimensional data, by condensing\ninformation down to a small number of relevant dimensions and applying\ngeometric clustering techniques.  Any algorithm to be used in this\ncontext must be fast, but it is perhaps more important to deal with\namounts of data that do not fit in memory, and keep to a minimum the\ntotal number of I/O operations needed, as has been considered in recent\nwork of Goodrich <I>et al.</I>\n(<A HREF=\"http://www.cs.duke.edu/~dev/abstracts/abstracts.html\">\"External-memory computational geometry\"</A>,\n34th FOCS, 1993, 714-723).
