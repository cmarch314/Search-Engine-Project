While the traditional \"art gallery\" problem, which\nconsists of guarding a given floorplan of an art gallery by a\nminimum number of guards seems to be mainly of theoretical\ninterest, a variation of this problem, where a 2.5 dimensional\nterrain rather than a two dimensional polygonal floorplan needs to\nbe guarded, is of practical significance in the planning of\nwireless communication networks, where minimizing the numbers of\nantennas reduces overall costs.</p>\n\n<p>In a visibility problem, we are given an input polygon, which\nmay or may not contain holes, or a 2.5 dimensional triangulated\nterrain. Since a lot of visibility problems are NP-hard, we study\nthe approximation characteristics of these problems. In the talk,\nan overview of recent inapproximability as well as approximability\nresults will be presented for a variety of NP-hard visibility\nproblems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>guarding a polygon with or without holes or a terrain with a\nminimum number of guards,</li>\n\n<li>hiding a maximum number of points from each other in a polygon\nor a terrain, and</li>\n\n<li>covering a polygon with a minimum number of convex polygons\nthat lie inside the given polygon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will discuss an inapproximability result for at least one of\nthese problems in more detail, which should give a general idea of\nhow to prove inapproximability of visibility problems. Finally, an\napproximation algorithm for a visibility problem will be\npresented.</p>\n\n<p>(Host: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pajarola/\">Renato\nPajarola</a>, <a href=\"mailto:pajarola@acm.org\">\npajarola@acm.org</a>.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3665.0}
