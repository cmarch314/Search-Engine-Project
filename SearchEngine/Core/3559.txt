Poly-X reduces the large number\nof degrees of freedom required to specify a protein motif in\ncomplete atomic detail. The result is a small number of parameters\nthat are easily understood by, and directly under the control of, a\ndomain expert. The system was applied to the poly-glutamine\n(poly-Q) repeat in the first exon of huntingtin, a gene region\nimplicated in Huntington's disease. We present four poly-Q\nstructural motifs: two poly-Q beta-sheet motifs (parallel and\nanti-parallel) that constitute plausible alternatives to a\npreviously published poly-Q beta-sheet motif, and two novel poly-Q\nhelices (alpha-helix and pi-helix). The motifs suggest that there\nmay be several plausible aggregation structures for intranuclear\ninclusion bodies, and may help in the effort to understand the\nstructural basis for Huntington's disease. \n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3559.0}
