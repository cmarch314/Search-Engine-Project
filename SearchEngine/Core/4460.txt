There are\ngood reasons for this: the data rates are relatively low when compared\nto other media (e.g. electric wires, radio) and the sounds tend to be\nannoying. But as more and more devices support an audio channel for\nvoice or music, that channel becomes a cheap option for transferring\narbitrary information among devices that happen to be near each other.\nSound is attractive for applications that do not require high bit rates\nand for which it is expensive to extend the hardware infrastructure\nwith radio or infrared transmitters. Some examples of those\napplications are: toys; broadcasting information through the sound of\nTV and radio that can be picked up by devices at home or in the car;\ntransferring names and phone numbers between cell phones; transferring\nbusiness cards between PDAs; and broadcasting location-dependent\ninformation from rooms into PDAs and laptops. Sound also has some\nnatural advantages over other media when security is at stake.</p>\n\n      <p>Motivated by the specific characteristics of the aerial\nacoustic communication paradigm used by humans and other animals, the\nDigital Voices project explores the use of sound as a communication\nmedium in ubiquitous computing environments. The inter-machine aerial\nacoustic communications are designed along the following criteria: </p>\n\n      <ul>\n\n        <li> The messages of these communication systems are\npleasant to humans. They are either imperceptible or, if perceivable,\nthey sound like music or familiar environment sounds such as birds,\nwind or water drops. </li>\n\n        <li> The systems are to be deployed in ordinary hardware.\nWe utilize the existing infrastructure for voice, avoiding extra costs.\n        </li>\n\n        <li> The systems are used in ordinary environments. This\nmeans that the communication has to be reasonably robust in the\npresence of noise such as people talking. </li>\n\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Listen to the sound samples on the left. <font color=\"#ffc0f0\">For those of you who like challenges, try to\ndecode the whole of the messages in the \"Listen\" list on the left.
