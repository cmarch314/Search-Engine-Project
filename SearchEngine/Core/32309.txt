{"text": "ICS 1C Homework 4 Guidelines and Assesment Criteria One document you may want to use as a model is John December s New Spiders Roam the Web Some of its good features There are many links to other documents and the anchor words are all well integrated into the flow of the document It uses HTML features such as italics headings and lists The tone is serious but lively This article however is not quite long enough for this assignment You should aim for a length of 3 to 5 full pages of text While December s article is a bit short the next example you might want to consult is a bit long Bertrand Ibrahim s and Steve Franklin s Advanced Educational Uses of the World Wide Web This paper is written in a more academic style than is December s it has an Abstract Introduction Conclusion Footnotes and Bibliography You can follow this format if you want to but it s a bit of over kill for this assignment Here are some criteria which will be used in assessing your work on this assignment Spelling and Proofreading There should be no indication that you wrote the document two hours before it was submitted even if that was the case A tip at the ea prompt enter spell doc html where doc html is the name of your document All words not in the dictionary will be listed There will be many false positives but all misspelled words will be listed as well Note The spell command is not a substitute for careful proofreading Style and tone Your document should be thoughtful serious and lively Try to avoid cliches hyperbole unsupported opinions slang jargon and passive sentences Take advantage of what HTML has to offer HTML offers hypertext links to other documents of course but there s much more internal links beginning with ordered and unordered lists inline gif pictures a variety of type styles such as bold or italic use very judiciously different levels of heading a descriptive and helpful title would a search engine that just looked at words in the title find your document when it should Appropriate breadth of topic Your topic should not be too broad or too narrow If it s too broad it may end up merely being a survey of a subject area If it s too narrow you may have trouble finding enough references and enough things to say Try to minimize the survey and overview part of your document although a few paragraphs may well be appropriate and emphasize the analysis and critique part of the document Interesting and thoughtful content Many of us have had the pleasant experience of coming across a mother lode document one which provides a useful overview of a subject area expresses opinions arising from a distinct and well thought out point of view and is chock full of links to related documents You should aim to produce a document of this nature Your document should go far beyond being a hotlist of URLs you have run across Although the format of this assignment is not question and answer it may be useful to formulate several questions about your topic and write your document so that those questions are answered The following questions are offered as examples of the types of questions that you may find helpful to consider and to address There is no requirement to ask or to answer these specific questions How has your subject matter been affected by WWW What will be the relationship between WWW and your subject matter in 2 years What types of people are interested in both WWW and your subject matter Professionals Academics Students Home computer users How can some of the elements of your topic you have to figure out what this means be arranged along a spectrum How can they be compared to each other How can the URLs you have found be categorized What are the main controversies on this topic What is your stance on these controversies Interesting links As far as possible your links should be to documents which are themselves interesting Prefer primary sources over secondary ones e g if you were writing on WWW search engines it would be better to link to Lycos and The Harvest Project than to December s New Spiders article If you are not writing about search engines then don t mention them this document is not about how you found the URLs you link to Of course there could be an exception to this rule if the path to the link was germane to your topic The five URLs you submitted with your proposal should just be a starting point ideally you ll have many more not all directly related to your topic see the December and Franklin documents for examples Reasonable length A document written by one person should be between 15 and 25 words between 3 to 5 full pages Documents with more than one author should be longer of course More than one author Generally if there are multiple authors we will expect a longer and higher quality paper The norm will be that all authors will receive the same score MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT OF ALL Normal considerations of academic honesty are in effect for this research project All words and ideas which are not your own must be properly attributed just as in every other research paper you have ever written or will ever write ", "_id":
