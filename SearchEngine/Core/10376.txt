find all matches and remove all matches defining both in terms of a more general handle all matches b 1 Do the same thing in the second restaurants program available at http www ics uci edu kay scheme restaurants2 scm with collection search and collection remove redefining both in terms of a general collection check function b 2 Now redefine collection check and collection change in terms of a still more general collection process function This one is complicated treat it as optional b 3 Simplify your definition of collection process or collection check and collection change using map filter foldr and similar functions Collect all of these definitions and submit them via Checkmate You should try to get at least this far by the end of Monday s lab c Be sure you ve read the section in Homework 6 about files now it s time to write a few file handling functions Download and install the simple file io ss teachpack at http www ics uci edu kay scheme simple file io ss Remember to right or control click on the link and download the file saving it in the same folder that contains your code We also have some file handling code which you should copy into your definitions file that provides an API consisting of these four functions for reading and writing text files file list string list Given a string naming a file read the lines in a file into a list of strings file dialog list anything list Show user a dialog box to choose a file read the file into a list of strings Call with file dialog list x because student Schemes don t allow parameterless functions list file string list side effects a new file Given a string naming a new file write list of strings that file one string per line list file dialog list side effects a new file Write a list of strings to a new file chosen by showing the user a file selection dialog These functions operate on text files files with the extension txt or other files that consist only of characters you can type on the keyboard Word documents don t work unless they re saved as plain text Scheme Racket files do work unless they re saved with images comment boxes or other non textual features Take the time to understand what these functions do Try a few sample calls to read and write some simple files It s a vital skill to be able to read an API to see what tools are available As you work on this part of the assignment take it step by step and make sure you know what s expected before you try to write the code The final product will be rather large and complex but we build it up using small relatively simple steps c 1 Define the function copy file that takes two strings the name of an existing file and the name of a new file and copies the contents of one to the other Use file list and list file Test it out with a short file Then download the Project Gutenberg version of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes from http www gutenberg org cache epub 1661 pg1661 txt Project Gutenberg is a wonderful resource for non copyright protected texts If you have to work on a slow network connection you may pick a smaller file this one is 577K Use your copy file program to make another copy of this file c 2 Write the function copy file dialog that takes one parameter that it ignores parameterless functions aren t allowed in the DrRacket student languages displays a dialog box for the user to select a file to copy displays another dialog box for the user to select the name of the copied file and then creates the copy Use file dialog list and list file dialog Test this function with a couple of files Testing of these file handling programs isn t quite as convenient as just putting examples into your code but it is essential nonetheless This is just an illustration of how interactive and imperative non functional programs add an extra layer of complexity to the computing task c 3 Write the function copy with line numbers that behaves like copy file except that the copied file has line numbers in this form 1 Project Gutenberg s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle 2 3 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with 4 almost no restrictions whatsoever You may copy it give it away or 13 52 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks The pre defined functions string append and number string may be helpful c 4 optional You ll notice that in your line numbered file the lines don t line up neatly because the numbers have different lengths It would be nice to be able to display a number in a five character field so that 17 would display as 17 with three spaces before the number pad5 string string If input string is 5 characters or longer return it unchanged Otherwise add enough blanks at the left of the string to make it 5 characters long Use this function in your line numbering program the pre defined function string length will be useful here Next write a generalized version of the function pad string number symbol string string The first argument is the input string The second is the desired length The third left or right indicates which end of the string should be padded The fourth is the string that should be added repeatedly until the string is at least as long as the desired length Examples pad Hi 5 right Hi pad Preface 12 right Preface Finally use these functions in your line numbering program so that the numbers are printed in five character fields except for numbers over 99 999 which should be as long as necessary Submit these definitions via Checkmate d Let s go back to our new restaurants with menus define struct rrant name cuisine phone menu where name cuisine and phone are strings and menu is a list of dishes define struct dish name price To the extent possible write the following definitions without using explicit recursion i e using map filter foldr and similar functions None of these modifications should require any change to the code for collections either d 1 Make up a big list of rrant structures to use in your testing Trade and combine lists with your classmates d 2 Make a copy of the restaurants2 scm program as modified in part b if possible and call it restaurants3 scm d 3 Modify the program to handle rrant objects that include menus You should try at least to make a list of all the changes you will need before looking at our checklist of modification steps and before looking back at the code we wrote in class d 4 Modify the program to display the average price of all the dishes on the menu whenever a restaurant is printed d 5 Add a command to the main menu that allows the user to search for and display all the restaurants that serve a given cuisine along with the average price of all the menus of the restaurants that serve that cuisine d 6 Add a command to the main menu that allows the user to search for and display all the restaurants that serve a dish containing a given word or phrase This is more realistic than forcing the user to type the exact name of the dish here at least the user can just type fava beans and match all the dishes that include that phrase The string processing functions from the previous part will make this task easier Collect all of these definitions and submit them via Checkmate e Remember that each partner must complete a partner evaluation form via the Survey tool on eee uci edu Based in part on ICS
