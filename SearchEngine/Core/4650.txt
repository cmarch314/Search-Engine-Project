first of a three quarter sequence covering the fundamentals of computer science We focus on software not just how to construct it but also how to choose and design the underlying algorithms how to organize the data involved and how to analyze its performance As an honors series these courses will cover a broader and deeper set of topics than the corresponding conventional courses The concepts we will cover transcend the details of particular programming languages but ICS H21 will use Scheme and Java and ICS H22 and H23 will use Java primarily ICS H21 is an exciting course because of the many horizons it broadens We welcome you and we hope you enjoy it Prerequisite concepts This course does not expect any previous experience in computer science or computer programming If you do have some experience you will find some topics familiar but many others will certainly be new to you We do expect each student to be able to navigate the Windows XP systems in our labs to navigate the World Wide Web to download and read documents in Adobe Acrobat pdf format and to read and send electronic mail Some of our assignments will require these skills If you need to pick these skills up or sharpen them you should do it in the first week of the quarter Meeting place and times Lecture meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 3 to 4 5 in SSPA 1165 Discussion and lab section meets Monday Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 1 5 starting in CS 253 and continuing CS 192 Most of your lab work will be done in pairs so you should plan to attend the scheduled lab times to work with your partner Office hours You are welcome to drop by my office at any time If I m there and not immersed in something else I ll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours during which course related matters will have first priority Wednesdays from 2 15 to 2 45 and Thursdays from 1 to 1 45 Of course emergencies may come up but I will try to give advance notice of any change I ll also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week The quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail as described below Questions and announcements You can usually get a response to your course related questions within a few hours a bit less frequently on the weekends by sending electronic mail to the ID icsh21 uci edu This goes to both of us and whoever reads it first can respond If you need to reach one of us individually use our individual IDs listed above We may also send course announcements by Email to the official course mailing list so you should check your Email regularly Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar has for you your UCInet ID If you prefer to read your Email on another account you should set your UCInet account to forward Email to your preferred account see http www nacs uci edu email forward html Don t let this slide if you miss official announcements your grade could suffer This course s web page is at http www ics uci edu kay courses h21 official course Email is archived at http e3 uci edu 5f w3m3 3623 and a course Note Board for student to student discussions is available when you log on to eee uci edu Textbook How to Design Programs by Felleisen Findler Flatt and Krishnamurthi This text has a web site at http www htdp org there you will find the full text of the book along with errata code for the book s examples and a guide to using the DrScheme software The on line version is slightly more current than the print version but many people find it tiresome to read lengthy technical material on the screen Labs and lab hours Of course you will need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday Wednesday Friday lab hours Students in ICS H21 may use any of the school s instructional computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the lab exclusively See http www ics uci edu lab for lab hours and other information Note in particular that all ICS labs are closed on university holidays such as the Friday after Thanksgiving but not the Saturday and Sunday Please remember that programming tasks always take longer to complete than you think they will no matter how much experience you have You must account for this as you plan your time we cannot accept busy schedules or time mismanagement as an excuse for late or incomplete assignments Course structure Weekly assignments some on paper and some on line 35 of the course grade All the assignments will be available at http www ics uci edu kay courses h21 hw Two midterms Given in lecture on October 2 and November 15 3 together One final exam On Tuesday December 6 from 4 to 6 p m 35 We expect that most students in this course will earn a final grade in the A range as you would have done had you been enrolled in a conventional offering of ICS 21 However that is not a guarantee that every student s grade will be an A Conventional ICS 21 itself is a six unit course that requires a major time commitment even from students with significant computing experience or strong academic backgrounds A grade of at least B in ICS H21 is required to continue into ICS H22 We re required to say that in unusual circumstances these criteria could change but we do not expect that to happen What to do this week to get started in ICS H21 If you do not have a UCInet ID an account on the EA system for reading electronic mail get one See http activate uci edu If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your UCInet account redirect your mail at http www nacs uci edu email forward html If you do not have an ICS account for access to the Windows network in ICS get one See http www ics uci edu computing account faq php On the Web go to checkmate ics uci edu log in with your UCInet ID choose Course Listing click Go next to ICS H21 and then click List me for this course You ll submit some of your work electronically this step is necessary to set that up Get a lab printing key card if you plan to do any printing in the lab Give a snapshot of yourself with your name written on the back to your TA This will help us learn your names quickly This is not just for fun it s a course requirement Also turn in your signed Questionnaire to your TA in discussion section Good advice and helpful hints Make every effort to attend the lectures we will make important announcements and often cover material that isn t directly in the textbook It s not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed though of course he will answer questions about it Attend your discussion and lab section too assignments will be discussed and collected there exams will be reviewed there and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture Don t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you Since most of your work will be done with a partner your partner also depends on your consistent presence Check your electronic mail regularly this is an official channel for course announcements Keep up with the reading you ll need it to do your assignments and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you re not careful You will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts that aren t clear The assignments like all technical specifications require careful and thorough reading and re reading Expect to refer back to the assignment often and check it first when you have questions about what s required or how to proceed Before you come to lab be sure to read the assignment to get an idea of what s required professional programmers plan on paper prior to starting to type Start each assignment early Assignments will be due weekly but you ll need to spend some time on them nearly every day Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will even if you have previous programming experience By starting early you ll have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter If you find yourself having trouble or getting behind speak with your TA or the instructor We have lots of ways to help But never take the shortcut of copying someone else s work and turning it in the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment ICS takes academic honesty very seriously for a more complete discussion see the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty issues http www ics uci edu ugrad current policies index php Turn in whatever portion of the assignment you have completed on the due date It s much better to turn in something rather than nothing zeroes are hard to make up In some circumstances you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after it s due but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date comes Always keep your own copy of each assignment both on diskette and on paper if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle or if a file server in the lab should crash which has happened we ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily Approximate course
