In this project I developed techniques to track objects\nin videos (being streamed on the browser). Basically, users annotate rigid objects of interest (e.g., car, people) on a video and the algorithm\nis supposed to track the motion of the objects. Since the object tracking had to work real time on streaming videos, \nno offline  preprocessing could be done. Further, since the entire system runs on the browser, it should not be computationally too expensive. \nWe used the color signature of the object of interest along with the color of the background, to design the tracking algorithm.  \n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 31056.0}
