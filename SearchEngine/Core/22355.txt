By a proper triangulation we mean a\nsubdivision of the square and its interior into nonoverlapping triangles in\nsuch a way that any two distinct triangles are either disjoint, have a single\nvertex in common, or have one entire edge in common; and by an interior\nvertex we mean a vertex (of a triangle) which lies inside the square but not\non its boundary. We begin with a proof, alternative to that of <A\nHREF=\"#L62\">Lindgren</A>, of the minimality-uniqueness of eight. Then we\nshow there is no triangulation into nine\ntriangles! And finally we demonstrate that there is a triangulation of the\nsquare into <I>n</I> acute-angled triangles for all <I>n</I> greater\nthan or equal to ten.\n\n<P><LI><A NAME=\"G84\">J. L.
