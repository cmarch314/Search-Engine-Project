A project or organization can compare their \npractices against a CMM to measure how mature their processes are, to \nbenchmark against competitors, and to identify improvement opportunities. \nThe Software CMM (SW-CMM), and its five level scale, has become a de facto \nstandard for assessing and improving software processes throughout the world.\n\n<p>\n\nThe success of the SW-CMM was soon copied by other disciplines, and has led \nto a world of CMMs. There are currently over 30 different CMMs in use \nthroughout industry, covering a variety of disciplines, and reflecting an \nassortment of structures and formats. This diversification is causing \nincreasing difficulty for developers and customers in selecting and applying \nthe right model(s).\n\n<p>\n\nThis talk presents an overview of the major CMMs in use today, and the status \nof the DoD CMM integration effort. It will include comparisons of the:\n\n<ul><li>        Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM)\n<li>\tSystems Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SE-CMM)\n<li> \tIntegrated Product Development Capability Maturity Model (IPD-CMM)\n<li> \tSystem Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM)\n<li> \tSoftware Acquisition Capability Maturity Model (SA-CMM)\n<li> \tPeople Capability Maturity Model (P-CMM)\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n\nRelationships to non-CMM standards, such as ISO 9000/9001, DoD-STD-2167A, \nMIL-STD-498, ISO 12207, and IEEE P1220, will also be highlighted.\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\n Dr. Rick Hefner is an SEI-authorized CBA-IPI Lead Assessor, with over 20 \nyears of experience in software development and process improvement. He is \na member of the DoD joint CMM Integration team and Co-Chair of the Assessment \nTeam, and he teaches locally on the SW-CMM and related subjects. Dr. Hefner \nserves as the Manager of Process Technology for TRW, where his focus is on \npractical, low-cost methods for process assessment, process improvement, and \ntraining. \n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html\">Directions</a> to meeting are available.\n\n<p>\n\n\nNext Meeting: <p>\n\n<blockquote>\nDate: Friday, May 29, 1998<br>\nTopic: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/flyers/98/may98.html\">\nA Systematic Approach to Continuous Process Improvement: An Introduction to the Theory of Constraints Thinking Process</a><br>\nSpeaker: David T.
