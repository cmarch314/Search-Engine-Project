In this paper we apply process programming to\nsoftware engineering teams and show how this can provide powerful new\ncapabilities for the management of software projects.  We identify key\nissues which must be addressed to apply process programming to teams,\nand present our vision for team-oriented process programming.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Jan 30 14:52:28 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 26278.0}
