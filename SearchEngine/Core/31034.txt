As for instance, \n  tagging of images by machines is a hard problem till date. Hence most search \n  engines organize media based on the text surrounding the media (html text/ tags \n  etc). <br> However the next generation of multimedia data have very different charac- \n    teristics. They are shot by smartphones, gps enabled cameras or high definition \n      DSLRs. These devices are likely to capture a host of contextual information like \n      time, location, camera parameters, voice tags and so on along with the media \n      itself. This data is much less noisy compared to the human induced tags in online \n      image sharing platform. However the challenge lies in correctly interpreting this \n      information and fusing the multi modal information. My research is focused on \n      exploring algorithms and designing systems which will enable multimedia orga- \n      nization using both context and content. I have chosen digital photo collections \n      as a representative of multimedia databases and have been running experiments \n      on them. \n\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div>\n<p>\nRelevant publications:\n<br>\nRamesh Jain, Pinaki Sinha.
