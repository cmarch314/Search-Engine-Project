I think I may have contacted your before\nabout the Langsams. My mother in law's first cousin was Marty Langsam who unfortunately passed last spring. \nHe was the son of Jack/Hyman, grandson of Aaron. His children are my wife's second cousins.\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/aaron.htm\n\nI have a very small part of the large Langsam tree if you ever are able to build it out on geni, and I am happy \nto merge to it.\n\nI can also explain the Kopita connection - the Langsams, Pearlmans and Kopitas intersect in about three places \nin the same tree. Abraham Kopita was technically a step-uncle of Jack Langsam's wife Tessie Pearlman. Tessie's \ngrandfather remarried a woman named Sarah Kopita - her son was Abraham. Abraham's wife Rose was also Aaron \nLangsam's younger sister so they all blend together. You really need a chart with lines and arrows to explain \nit all.\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew Monfried \nDallas, TX \nmonfried73@yahoo.com\n</pre>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\n<HR>\n<P>\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\n<BR>\nMy home address is<PRE>\n           1374 East 28th Street\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\n           USA\n</PRE>\n  \n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 10/7/2013</FONT>\n<P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>", "id": 26295.0}
