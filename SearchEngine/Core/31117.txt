A centralized server managed all the projectors and also the camera(s) used to calibrate the display. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous distributed calibration methodology via a display unit called the plug-and-play projector (PPP). The PPP consists of a projector, camera, computation and communication unit, thus creating a self-sufficient module that enables an asynchronous distributed architecture for multi-projector displays. We present a single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) calibration algorithm that runs on each PPP and achieves a truly scalable and reconfigurable display without any input from the user. It instruments novel capabilities like adding/removing PPPs from the display dynamically, detecting faults, and reshaping the display to a reasonable rectangular shape to react to the addition/removal/faults. \n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nRelevant publications:\n<br>\nEzekiel Bhasker, Pinaki Sinha, Aditi Majumder Asynchronous Distributed Calibration for Scalable\nReconfigurable Multi Projector Displays, IEEE Transactions in Visualization and Computer Graphics\n(TVCG), 2006. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~psinha/viz06.pdf\">pdf</a>\n<br>\nPinaki Sinha, Ezekiel Bhasker, Aditi Majumder, \"Mobile Displays via Auto Reconfigurable Projector Camera Pairs\",\nPROCAMS (workshop on Projector Camera Systems), CVPR, 2006, NY.\n<br>\n</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\nFollowing is a video demonstration of our system:<hr>\n<div>\n<object width=\"960\" height=\"745\">\n<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/AYa70UT309Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\">\n</param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/AYa70UT309Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"960\" height=\"745\">\n</embed></object>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 31117.0}
