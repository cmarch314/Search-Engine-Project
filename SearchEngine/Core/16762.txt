The Flickr Data Set has been created by crawling photos from Flickr\r\nand choosing the correct tags for photos (Tags are often erroneous in the raw state). The Home Data Set has been created by contributions from personal photo albums.\r\nThis dataset has been manually tagged. <br>\r\n\r\nEach dataset has the following databases:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <b>imgTagMatrix </b>: This is the image tag joint matrix. Each row is an image and each column is a tag. If an image has a tag then te corresponding\r\ncell has a value 1, else 0.\r\n<li><b>tagList</b>: This is the tag Vocabulary list.\r\n<li> <b>pixelFeaturesDB</b>: These are the pixel features computed on the image pixels. The size of this table is IxMxN, where I is the number\r\nof images in the database, M is the number of rectangles in an image and N is the dimensionality of the feature vector. For our experiments\r\nwe chose M=20 and N=42. Hence there are 20 rectangles in each image. The feature vector is of size 42 and the features are ordered in the following manner:\r\nthe first 16 dimensions are color histogram feature on HSV space. The next 9 are color moments on RGB space. The next 12 are Gabor wavelet\r\ntexture features. The last 5 are edge histogram features (using a canny edge detector).\r\n\r\n<li> <b>thumbFeaturesDB</b>: These are the pixel features computed on the thumbnail image. The size of this table is IxN, where I is the number\r\nof images in the database and N is the size of the feature vector. (Each thumbnail image is considered as the single rectangle in an image).\r\nThe feature vector is as above.\r\n\r\n<li> <b>exifFeatureDB </b>: This is a table of optical features. Each row is an image. The columns are as follows:\r\nflash, exposure time, focal length, f-number, ISO-rating.\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\nOther than the above tables, the <b> Flickr Data Set </b> has a table <b> imgURL</b>, each row of which is  is the URL of the corresponding\r\nimages in our database.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Databases are in Matlab mat file format.
