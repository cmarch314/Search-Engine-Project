The virtue of the\r\nAND/OR representation of the search space is that its size may be far smaller than that of\r\na traditional OR representation, which can translate into significant time savings for search\r\nalgorithms. The focus of this paper is on linear space search which explores the AND/OR\r\nsearch tree. In the second paper we explore memory intensive AND/OR search algorithms.\r\nIn conjunction with the AND/OR search space we investigate the power of the mini-bucket\r\nheuristics in both static and dynamic setups. We focus on two most common optimization\r\nproblems in graphical models: finding the Most Probable Explanation in Bayesian networks\r\nand solving Weighted CSPs. In extensive empirical evaluations we demonstrate that the\r\nnew AND/OR Branch-and-Bound approach improves considerably over the traditional OR\r\nsearch strategy and show how various variable ordering schemes impact the performance\r\nof the AND/OR search scheme.\r\n\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r151.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 4851.0}
