The main virtue of\r\n  the AND/OR representation is its sensitivity to the structure of the\r\n  graphical model, which can translate into significant time\r\n  savings. Indeed, in recent years depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound\r\n  algorithms were shown to be very effective when exploring such\r\n  search spaces, especially when using caching. Since best-first\r\n  strategies are known to be superior to depth-first when memory is\r\n  utilized, exploring the best-first control strategy is called\r\n  for. In this paper we introduce two classes of best-first AND/OR\r\n  search algorithms: those that explore a context-minimal AND/OR\r\n  search graph and use static variable orderings, and those that use\r\n  dynamic variable orderings but explore an AND/OR search tree. The\r\n  superiority of the best-first search approach is demonstrated\r\n  empirically on various real-world benchmarks.</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r143.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8604.0}
