Combinatorics</i> 17(1), Paper R136, 2010</a>.\n<p>\nFor every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar\ngraphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in\nan n-vertex graph in the family is\n<i>c</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>o</i>(<i>n</i>); for instance, for\nplanar graphs, <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. We call <i>c</i> the limiting\ndensity of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of\nall minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting\ndensities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least\n&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>, and we find an exact description of the\nmembers of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and&nbsp;3/2.\n<p>\n<li><b>On 2-site Voronoi diagrams under geometric distance functions</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~barequet/\">G.
