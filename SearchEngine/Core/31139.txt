The client applications you will use with\nChimera are dependent on a program called the Chimera Server.  This\nserver runs in the same environment as your \nclient applications, and it provides access to Chimera.  To understand \nwhy the Chimera Server is in place on the client end\nof the system, consider the following.\n</p>\n\n<H3> Rationale for the Chimera Server </H3>\n\n<p> When you started the Chimera Website\nand its associated three servers, you were providing the general\nservices of Chimera, in this case to yourself.  Since Chimera\nis freely available, there could be a multitude of Chimera Websites\nrunning, each providing different contents (i.e. different \nwebs, links, etc.).  Further, these Chimera Websites can \nbe located on a LAN or WAN, thus they could be running on different machines\nor accounts than where you are.  Client applications have the potential\nof being connected in arbitrary locations.  This could be problematic\nif your applications are connected to different websites and webs.  These\ninconsistencies can lead to a situation where your applications become \ndisconnected to each other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo control this complexity, a server is provided which provides you with\nthe ability to direct your client applications to particular websites \nand webs.  This server is the Chimera Server and all client applications\nlook for it as their conduit to Chimera.\n</p>\n\n<H3>Starting the Chimera Server from different Platforms</H3>\n\n<p>\nTo start the Chimera Server in your user's environment you need to \nexecute the program chimeraServer from \nanywhere (any directory) you wish in your account.  \nThe Java byte-code for the \nChimera Server is located in the chimera.jar file which you used to\nstart the Chimera Website earlier in the tutorial.  \n</p>\n\n<p> You must have the following in the CLASSPATH environment variable \nso that your Java interpretor can execute the chimeraServer program.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> swing 1.0.1\n    <li> JSDK 1.0.1\n\t<br>\n\tNote: JDK 1.2 (currently in beta 3) contains JSDK and swing, you will\n\tnot need the above two packages if you are using JDK 1.2.\n    <li> HTTPClient 0.3\n    <li> Rivendell 0.6\n    <li> MSXML 1.8\n\n\t<p>(see \n\t<A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">Preparing your System for Chimera </A>\n\tto see how to include the packages listed above.)\n\t</p>\n\n    <li> chimera2b2.jar (see\n\t<A HREF=\"downloading_chimera.html\">Downloading Chimera </A>\n\tto see how to include chimera.jar)\n</ul>\n\n<p> Depending on what platform you are using, you will start the Chimera \nServer differently:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> Using Unix, enter chimeraServer to start the Chimera Server.\n\t<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_start.gif\" WIDTH=\"315\"\n\tHEIGHT=\"75\"></CENTER>\n\n    <li> Using Windows NT, enter the following in the\n\tcommand line interface to start the Chimera Server.\n\t<br>\n\t<tt>java chimera.chimeraServer</tt>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p> The Chimera Server should appear as the following window.\n</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n\n<p> Note: the window will appear slightly differently on different platforms.\n\n<p> \nYou now have the Chimera Server running for your client applications,\nthe next step is to establish the communication connection between\nthis server and the Chimera Website you are interested in.\n</p>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 31139.0}
