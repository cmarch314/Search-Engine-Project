It is shown that several known properties of A* retain their\r\nform (with the minmax offplaying the role of the optimal cost), which helps establish general tests of\r\nadmissibility and general conditions for node expansion for these strategies. On the basis of this\r\nframework the computational optimality of A*, in the sense of never expanding a node that can be\r\nskipped by some other algorithm having access to the same heuristic information that A* uses, is\r\nexamined. A hierarchy of four optimality types is defined and three classes of algorithms and four\r\ndomains of problem instances are considered. Computational performances relative to these algorithms\r\nand domains are appraised. For each class-domain combination, we then identify the strongest type of\r\noptimality that exists and the algorithm for achieving it. The main results of this paper relate to the\r\nclass of algorithms that, like A*, return optimal solutions (i.e., admissible) when all cost estimates are\r\noptimistic (i.e., h<=h*). On this class, A* is shown to be not optimal and it is also shown that no\r\noptimal algorithm exists, but if the performance tests are confirmed to casesin which the estimates are\r\nalso consistent, then A* is indeed optimal. Additionally, A* is also shown to be optimal over a subset\r\nof the latter class containing all best-first algorithms that are guided by path-dependent evaluation\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r0.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 4777.0}
