In this paper, we develop new AND/OR branch and bound algorithms for marginal MAP that use heuristics extracted from weighted mini-buckets enhanced with message-passing updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting search algorithms against previous join-tree based approaches, which we also extend to accommodate high induced width models, through extensive empirical evaluations. Our results show not only orders-of-magnitude improvements over the state-of-the-art, but also the ability to solve problem instances well beyond the reach of previous approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r209.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8591.0}
