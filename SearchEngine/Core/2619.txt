3425 Overview Prerequisites and Frequently Asked Questions UCI Catalog Description Study of the requirements concepts and architectures of comprehensive integrated software development and maintenance environments Major topics include process support object management communication interoperability measurement analysis and user interfaces in the environment context Themes Software architectures and composition technologies This offering of ICS 228 as with its predecessor adopts something of a design studio approach to the topic During the quarter the class will jointly create a software development environment focused on architecture centric development In particular the environment will aim to provide lifecycle support for applications developed in the C2 architectural style Since this was the focus of the previous class s project you can expect to build upon their results Moreover the architeture itself will be an application built in the style so it will be amenable to further evolution using itself Textbook and Readings Textbook None Readings See the schedule for primary required readings A couple of the papers are available on line Others will be made available for reproduction Discussion Section surprise Successfully pursuing the project will require some focused instruction in the cornerstone technologies the xADL architecture representation mechanism the c2 fw architectural framework and so on To provide this instruction we ll be holding discussion sections during the first half of the quarter Unfortunately this section was not scheduled through the Registrar so we ll have to quickly identify a time and place where everyone can meet To faciliate this please bring your schedule to the first meeting of class and we ll decide the time then Eric Dashofy will be running the Discussion Section and maintaining its website Assignments and Assessment NameAssignment Weight Pop quizzes no kidding These will be simple short in class quizzes designed to assess whether or not you ve read the assigned readings If you have read the papers these quizzes will be a snap If you haven t read them I ll be able to tell Be sure to bring pen cil and paper to class everyday just in case 15 Progress reports and presentations These are oral reports to the class covering the progress you ve made in the previous week on your part of the course project 15 Project You will be developing a part of a software development environment cooperatively with the rest of the class This portion of your grade will reflect what you ve built as part of the project 35 Summary paper By the time you re done with your part of the development project you ll necessarily know the related work what you ve done what happened when you tried to integrate with the other students projects and how well the C2 framework et al supported you in your task All you have to do here is capture that understanding in a paper not to exceed 5 words unless you are REALLY interesting With luck this paper will be publishable 35 Schedule Subject to Change Date Topic Reading Assigned Project Week 1 January 7 9 Overview Themes AST based environments Event based
