{"text": "Combinatorial Geometry This is a difficult topic to define precisely without including all of discrete and computational geometry What I mean by combinatorial geometry consists of problems in which one starts with a geometric figure say a polytope but then considers abstract incidence properties of it rather than its metric properties Most tiling and coloring problems fit into this class but since they have their own sections of the junkyard I omit them here Colinear points on knots Greg Kuperberg shows that a non trivial knot or link in R3 necessarily has four colinear points A

the Menger sponge provides an infinite example How many intersection points can you form from an n line arrangement Equivalently how many opposite pairs of faces can an n zone zonohedron have It must be a number between n 1 and n n 1 2 but not all of those values are possible How many points can one find in three dimensional space so that all triangles are equilateral or isosceles One eight point

From my 1992\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-TR-92-86.pdf\">tech. report</A>.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/polygonization/\">Simple\npolygonizations</A>. Erik Demaine explores the question of how many\ndifferent non-crossing traveling salesman tours an n-point set can have.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"simplex-section.html\">Simplex/hyperplane intersection</A>.\nDoug Zare nicely summarizes the shapes that can arise on intersecting\na simplex with a hyperplane: if there are p points on the hyperplane,\nm on one side, and n on the other side, the shape is\n(a projective transformation of)\na p-iterated cone over the product of m-1 and n-1 dimensional simplices.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"msp-toroid.html\">Six-regular toroid</A>.\nMike Paterson asks whether it is possible to make a torus-shaped polyhedron\nin which exactly six equilateral triangles meet at each vertex.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"skewer.html\">Skewered lines</A>.\nJim Buddenhagen notes that four lines in general position in R<sup>3</sup>\nhave exactly two lines crossing them all, and asks how this generalizes\nto higher dimensions.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/blatter.htm\">Solution\nto problem 10769</A>.  Apparently problems of coloring the points of a\nsphere so that orthogonal points have different colors (or so that each\nset of coordinate basis vectors has multiple colors) has some relevance\nto quantum mechanics; see also papers\n<A HREF=\"http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9905080\">quant-ph/9905080</A> and\n<A HREF=\"http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9911040\">quant-ph/9911040</A>\n(on coloring just the rational points on a sphere), as well as this\n<A HREF=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kochen-specker/#quick\">four-dimensional construction</A>\nof an odd number of basis sets in which each vector appears an even\nnumber of times, showing that one can't color the points on a\nfour-sphere so that each basis set has exactly one black point.\n<P>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smartsc.com/zome/solvingPetersen.html\">Solving\nthe Petersen Graph Zome Challenge</a>.\nDavid MacMahon discovers that there is no way to make a\nnon-self-intersecting peterson graph with Zome tool.\nIncludes VRML illustrations.\n<p>\n<LI><A HREF=\"sylvester.html\">Sylvester's theorem</A>.\nThis states that any finite non-colinear point set has\na line containing only two points (equivalently, every zonohedron has a\nquadrilateral face).  Michael Larsen, Tim Chow, and Noam\nElkies discuss two proofs and a complex-number generalization.\n(They omit the very simple generalization from <A HREF=\"euler/\">Euler's\nformula</A>: every convex polyhedron has a face of degree at most five.)\n<P>\n<li><a href=\"szilassi.html\">The Szilassi Polyhedron</a>.\nThis polyhedral torus, discovered by\n<a href=\"http://www.jgytf.u-szeged.hu/tanszek/matematika/personal/Szilassi/\">L.\nSzilassi</a>, has seven hexagonal faces, all adjacent to each other.\nIt has an axis of 180-degree symmetry; three pairs of faces are congruent\nleaving one unpaired hexagon that is itself symmetric.\n<a href=\"http://www.minortriad.com/szilassi.html\">Tom\nAce has more images</a> as well as a downloadable unfolded pattern\nfor making your own copy.\nSee also Dave Rusin's page on\n<a\nhref=\"http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/95/polyhedr.tori\">polyhedral\ntori with few vertices</a> and\n<a\nhref=\"http://blog.sciencenews.org/mathtrek/2007/01/a_polyhedron_with_a_hole.html\">Ivars'\nPeterson's MathTrek article</a>.\n<p><div align=center><img src=\"szilassi.gif\" width=317 height=290\nalt=\"Szilassi polyhedron\"></div><p>\n<LI><A HREF=\"tangencies/\">Tangencies</A>.\nAnimated compass and straightedge constructions of\nvarious patterns of tangent circles.\n<P>\n<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=\"tangencies/\"><IMG SRC=\"tangencies/thumbnail.gif\"\nBORDER=0 WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=143 ALT=\"three tangent circles\"></A></DIV><P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.thrackle.org/thrackle.html\">Thrackles</A>\nare graphs embedded as a set of curves in the plane that cross each\nother exactly once; Conway has conjectured that an <I>n</I>-vertex\nthrackle has at most <I>n</I> edges.\nStephan Wehner describes what is known about thrackles.\n<P>\n<li><a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-COMB-01.pdf\">Triangles and squares</a>.\nSlides from a talk I gave relating a simple 2d puzzle, Escher's drawings\nof 3d polyhedra, and the combinatorics of 4d polytopes, via angles in\nhyperbolic space.
