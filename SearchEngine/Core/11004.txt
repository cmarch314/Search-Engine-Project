{"text": "From dillenco baltic ics uci edu Michael Dillencourt Date 1 Dec 1996 5 24 54 GMT Newsgroups comp theory Subject Re Traveling Salesman Problem and Delaunay Graphs Recently Michael I Shamos posted the following message In a recent post Walter Schmitting asserts that my 1978 Ph D thesis on Computational Geometry contains the conjecture that a Euclidean traveling salesman tour is a subgraph of the Voronoi dual This conjecture appears nowhere in the thesis nor in any other of my published writings I can confirm that I did indeed conjecture for a period of about three weeks that the stated result was true A counterexample was shown to me by Richard Karp during a visit of his to CMU in 1977 long before the result of Kantabutra and Dillencourt The conjecture appeared for a brief time in my unpublished notes entitled Problems in Computational Geometry As I was not a referee of the Kantabutra Dillencourt paper I was unable to correct any misimpression it may have given I have exchanged several email messages with Dr Shamos since he posted this message I have also checked my earlier papers and Kantabutra s paper I think at this point we can all agree that Dr Shamos is right he never published a conjecture of this result and neither Kantabutra nor I ever claimed he did There never was a joint Kantabutra Dillencourt paper This question of whether the Voronoi dual of a set of points necessarily contained the Euclidean traveling salesman cycle was listed as an open problem in Dr Shamos PhD thesis page 2 6 6 Dr Shamos told me that Prof Karp showed him the counterexample after his thesis had been submitted to University Microfilms which is where I got my copy I was curious about the 1977 counterexample Dr Shamos did not recall the details and Prof Karp did not remember either discussing the problem or solving it Dr Shamos said that he discussed the question with Prof Karp who showed him how to construct a counterexample and most likely promptly forgot about it I can easily believe that this could have happened At one point in my email exchange with Dr Shamos I erroneously interpreted one of his statements to imply that Prof Karp had shown him a 4 point counterexample Dr Shamos later clarified this in a subsequent message but in the meantime I thought about the problem and realized there is a 5 point counterexample This is better than the 7 point counterexample in my 1985 paper IPL 24 5 March 1987 339 342 This may or may not have been the same example Prof Karp discovered in 1977 but in any case I thought it might be useful to describe it here So now finally we get to the real point of this post which is to describe a 5 point example of a Delaunay triangulation that does not contain the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Cycle ETSC as a subgraph This is the smallest such example The counterexample can be constructed as follows Take four cocircular points A B C D in that order about a circle Choose a fifth point E outside the circle chosen so that the convex hull of the five points is the triangle ADE and so that C is very close to the edge DE If E is far enough outside the circle and if the other four points are chosen appropriately one can force the ETSC to be the cycle ABDCEA If B is perturbed by a tiny amount and moved just outside the circumcircle of ACD then edge BD will not be in the Delaunay triangulation Rather than work out appropriate point locations analytically I ran an experiment I generated four random points on a unit circle choosing theta uniformly and then generated a fifth point randomly outside the unit circle and inside a circle of radius 8 choosing theta uniformly and choosing the radius uniformly in the range 1 8 Out of 1 iterations 27 9 2 7 of the configurations generated were such that the ETSC contained one of the chords of the four cocircular points BD in the terminology of the preceding paragraph after relabeling In each such case if one of the endpoints of the chord is moved slightly so it is just outside the circle the Delaunay triangulation will not contain the chord There does not exist a four point counterexample if we disallow the trivial case of a totally collinear point set Given any planar set of four points either the points are in convex position and the ETSC is the convex hull which is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation or the Delaunay triangulation is the complete graph As I mentioned above the example in my 1985 paper contained seven points so it was not minimal That example also was the minimum weight triangulation of its vertex set I don t know whether the construction sketched above can be used to construct a 5 point Delaunay triangulation that is also a minimum weight triangulation and does not contain the ETSC

I have also checked my earlier papers and Kantabutra's\npaper.  I think at this point we can all agree that Dr. Shamos is right,\nhe never published a conjecture of this result, and neither Kantabutra\nnor I ever claimed he did.  (There never was a joint Kantabutra-Dillencourt \npaper.)\n\nThis question of whether the Voronoi dual of a set of points necessarily\ncontained the Euclidean traveling salesman cycle was listed as an open \nproblem in Dr. Shamos' PhD thesis (page 206, #6).  Dr. Shamos\ntold me that Prof. Karp showed him the counterexample after\nhis thesis had been submitted to University Microfilms, which\nis where I got my copy.  \n\nI was curious about the 1977 counterexample.  Dr. Shamos did not recall\nthe details, and Prof. Karp did not remember either discussing the \nproblem or solving it.  Dr. Shamos said that he discussed the question\nwith Prof. Karp, who showed him how to construct a counterexample\nand (most likely) promptly forgot about it.  I can easily believe\nthat this could have happened.\n\nAt one point in my email exchange with Dr. Shamos, I erroneously\ninterpreted one of his statements to imply that Prof. Karp had shown him\na 4-point counterexample.  Dr. Shamos later clarified this in\na subsequent message, but in the meantime I thought about the\nproblem and realized there is a 5-point counterexample.  This\nis better than the 7-point counterexample in my 1985 paper \n[IPL 24(5), March 1987, 339-342].  This may or may not have\nbeen the same example Prof. Karp discovered in 1977,\nbut in any case I thought it might be useful to describe it here.  \n\nSo now, finally, we get to the real point of this post, which is to describe\na 5-point example of a Delaunay triangulation that does not\ncontain the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Cycle (ETSC) as a subgraph.\nThis is the smallest such example.\n\nThe counterexample can be constructed as follows.  Take four cocircular\npoints A,B,C,D, in that order about a circle.  Choose a fifth point\nE, outside the circle, chosen so that the convex hull of the five points\nis the triangle ADE and so that C is very close to the edge DE.\nIf E is far enough outside the circle, and if the other four points\nare chosen appropriately, one can force the ETSC to be the cycle\nABDCEA.  If B is perturbed by a tiny amount and moved just outside \nthe circumcircle of ACD, then edge BD will not be in the \nDelaunay triangulation.\n\nRather than work out appropriate point locations analytically, \nI ran an experiment.  I generated four random points on a unit \ncircle (choosing theta uniformly), and then generated a fifth point\nrandomly outside the unit circle and inside a circle of radius 8\n(choosing theta uniformly, and choosing the radius uniformly in the \nrange [1,8]).  Out of  100,000 iterations, 2709 (2.7%) of the\nconfigurations generated were such that the ETSC contained one of the\nchords of the four cocircular points (BD in the terminology of the preceding \nparagraph, after relabeling).  In each such case, if one of the\nendpoints of the chord is moved slightly so it is just outside the circle,  \nthe  Delaunay triangulation will not contain the chord.  \n\nThere does not exist a four-point counterexample, if we disallow\nthe trivial case of a totally collinear point set.  Given any planar\nset of four points, either the points are in convex position\n(and the ETSC is the convex hull, which is a subgraph of the Delaunay\ntriangulation) or the Delaunay triangulation is the complete graph.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the example in my 1985 paper contained \nseven points, so it was not minimal.  That example also was the \nminimum-weight triangulation of its vertex set.  I don't know whether \nthe construction sketched above can be used to construct a 5-point \nDelaunay triangulation that is also a minimum-weight triangulation and \ndoes not contain the ETSC.\n\nI'll post a picture of a specific 5-point example on my web\nsite in the next week or so.\n=============================================================================\nMichael B.
