Raw input about unfolding events may arrive from variety of sources in the form of sensor data, video streams, human observations, and so on, from which events of interest are extracted. Location is one of the most important attributes of events, useful for a variety of SA tasks. In this paper, we propose an approach to model and represent (potentially uncertain) event locations described by human reporters in the form of free text. We analyze several types of spatial queries of interest in SA applications. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Categories and Subject Descriptors:</H3>\r\nH.2.8 [<B>Information System</B>]: Database Management\ufffdSpatial databases and GIS\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3>\r\nModeling, Retrieval, Uncertain, Probability\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\n<!-- <font color=red> Downloads of the drafts are temporarily disabled.</font><BR>  -->\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/GIS06_dvk_model.pdf\">GIS06_dvk_model.pdf</A><BR>\r\nPresentation: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/GIS06_dvk_model.ppt\">GIS06_dvk_model.ppt</A><BR>\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?GIS06_dvk_model\" width=1 height=1>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{ACMGIS06::dvk_model,\r\n   author    = {Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Yiming Ma and Sharad Mehrotra and Ram Hariharan and Carter Butts},\r\n   title     = {Modeling and Querying Uncertain Spatial Information for Situational Awareness Applications},\r\n   booktitle = {Proc. of Int'l Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM GIS 2006)},\r\n   year      = {2006},\r\n   month     = {November 10--11},\r\n   address   = {Arlington, VA, USA}\r\n}\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n</html>", "id": 4878.0}
