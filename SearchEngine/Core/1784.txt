contributed during my PhD program Characterization and optimization of WebRTC software stack on ATOM based mobile platforms This project was a joint effort with UC Irvine and Intel Corporation Machine learning assited compilation This project was a joint effort with UC Irvine and Yahoo Inc Program similarity and its implications to program and system performance modeling and prediction This project was a joint effort with UC Irvine and Yahoo Inc Architecture aware loop scheduling This project was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation Metrology applied to performance analysis using hardware performance counters Undergraduate research mentoring From Summer 2 12 until the end of the Academic Year 2 13 I worked side by side with a second year undergraduate student at UC Irvine Last summer this student was awarded with funding from CalIt2 through the SURF IT Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Information Technology program Afterwards he was awarded with additional funding from UCI through the UROP program until the end of the current academic year Results of this project were proudly presented at the 2 th Annual UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium
