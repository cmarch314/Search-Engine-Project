{"text": "ICS 184 EECS 116 Summer 2 6 News Course Reference Schedule Lab Manual ics 184 newsgroup About Alex ICS 184 EECS 116 Summer 2 6 Setting Up Java On Your Computer A word of warning One of the advantages of programming in Java is that it s possible to set up your own computer as a Java development environment easily and cheaply On the other hand working in the lab has some genuine benefits particularly for those of you who are fairly new to programming and or fairly new to UCI In the lab you ll find that help is more readily available when you get stuck that your machine setup will generally be stable and designed well for the task of working on your assignments and that you re free from the distractions of your home Nevertheless I m aware that many of you either out of want or need will choose to do some percentage of your work at home What follows is enough information to turn your Windows based or Macintosh computer into a Java development environment at little or no cost What s in this document Before you get started be aware that this document only describes how to set up Java on a computer running Windows or Mac OS X If you use Linux J2SE 5 can be downloaded from java sun com the same way it can for Windows You re on your own as far as installing it goes but I assume you can handle that or you wouldn t be Linux users The document is broken into separate sections detailing how to install Java on Windows and on Mac OS X these sections follow Setting up Java on Windows Getting started First and foremost you need a Java compiler and Java virtual machine both of which must support Java 5 A great option is to download the Java 2 Standard Edition J2SE JDK from java sun com This is available absolutely free The latest version is 5 Update 7 Be sure you download the JDK and not the JRE The JDK includes a Java compiler javac a Java virtual machine java and all of the standard Java library components in other words everything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem domains and more than enough firepower for the assignments we ll be giving you The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment which includes the necessary code to allow you to run Java programs but not to write and compile them The JRE will not be sufficient for our work in this course Secondly you ll need a text editor which you ll use to write and edit your program code There are many inexpensive and or free options available In the lab we provide TextPad which you can download from www textpad com TextPad requires a modest registration fee which you should pay if you plan to use it on a continuous basis You may be able to find free text editors particularly those written in Java at shareware freeware download sites such as www download com Installation the easy part Presumably your text editor will include an installation program to set it up and make it completely ready for your use The JDK also includes an installation program which places all of the files into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts for you However after running the installation program you still won t be able to execute javac or java without making a couple of modifications under the hood of your system When asked what folder you should install the JDK into the default will be C Program Files Java jdk1 5 I suggest changing it to the following folder instead C jdk5 The reason for this suggestion is that the next steps in the installation process will be simpler if the folder you choose has a shorter name that importantly has no spaces in it The not all that hard part PATH and CLASSPATH You can execute programs from a Command Prompt or as Windows 95 98 call it an MS DOS prompt by simply typing their names such as javac or java But there s a catch Windows has to know where it can find these programs This is the job of the PATH environment variable PATH is a list of folders separated by semicolons in which Windows will look for a program whenever you try to execute one Similarly whenever the Java compiler or Java virtual machine need to be able to use a Java class such as when you import a class from the Java library the compiler or virtual machine needs to be able to know where to find it This is the job of the CLASSPATH environment variable CLASSPATH is a list of folders separated by semicolons in which the Java compiler or virtual machine will look for a Java class whenever it s trying to find one So to make the JDK work you have to modify the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables on your system so that Windows will be able to find javac and java and so that javac and java will be able to find all of the necessary Java classes How you modify these variables depends on which version of Windows you re using In either case I ll assume that you ve installed the JDK into the folder I suggested during installation which is C jdk5 If you installed it somewhere else you ll need to use your installation directory instead of the one above On Windows 2 and XP Right click the My Computer icon on your desktop and select Properties Select the Advanced tab Click the Environment Variables button Under System variables find the PATH variable and add this to the end of it C jdk5 bin Then find the CLASSPATH variable If it doesn t exist and it probably won t if you ve never used your system to develop Java code click the New button specifying CLASSPATH as its name and the following value C jdk5 lib You may need to restart your system or at least start up a new Command Prompt window in order for these changes to take effect On Windows 95 98 and probably ME I say probably because I don t have a version of ME handy to test this with On these versions of Windows you can set the PATH and CLASSPATH by modifying the file C AUTOEXEC BAT Add the following two lines to the end of this file set PATH PATH C jdk5 bin set CLASSPATH CLASSPATH C jdk5 lib You ll probably need to restart your system for these changes to take effect That s it At this point you should be good to go Enjoy Setting up Java on Mac OS X Getting started First your Mac has to be running MacOS X 1 4 2 Tiger or later If you re running an earlier version it s time to upgrade the current Java won t run on your machine On Mac OS X you can find your version number by selecting About This Mac under the apple menu If you re running MacOS 9 it s really time to upgrade probably to a new machine Finding help if you get stuck during this process Because I m not a Mac user I unfortunately won t be able to help if you get stuck while following this process If you re having trouble I d encourage you to seek help from knowledgeable friends and or other students perhaps by posting a message to the course newsgroup Downloading and installing Java Download the current version of J2SE 5 from Apple Double click the installer package and follow the instructions to complete the installation Making J2SE 5 your default Java version MacOS X is perfectly happy to let different versions of Java coexist on your machine installing J2SE 5 doesn t remove any earlier versions and doesn t even make J2SE 5 the default Java on your machine To make J2SE 5 the default follow these steps Open the Terminal application in the Utilities folder When the terminal window opens up you get what s called a Unix shell a program that reads and responds to Unix commands you type This is the command line from which you ll be running all your Java programs unless you start using an IDE Copy the following two lines using command C or Copy on the Edit menu alias javac System Library Frameworks JavaVM framework Versions 1 5 Commands javac alias java System Library Frameworks JavaVM framework Versions 1 5 Commands java In the Terminal window type the command cat profile be careful about the spacing and the period and hit the Return key Now paste the two lines you just copied then hit Return again Next hit control D i e hold down the Ctrl key as you press the d key Then close the Terminal window by command W by typing the command logout or by hitting control D again Testing your Java installation To test your installation first open a new Terminal window by command N or choosing New Shell on the File menu then type this command java version You should see something like the following java version 1 5 5 Java TM 2 Runtime Environment Standard Edition build 1 5 5 83 Java HotSpot TM Client VM build 1 5 5 48 mixed mode sharing If you see something without 1 5 and with 1 4 or some other version then you ll need to get further assistance One possible cause is that one or both of the two alias lines was copied with a carriage return in the middle each of the two lines needs to be unbroken A second possible cause is that you re using a different shell program than the current default To find out choose Preferences from the Terminal menu in the Terminal application If you see bin bash in the first box you re using the current default and you ll need to find an expert But if you see something else there click the Execute this command button and type bin bash in the box Then quit Terminal start it again and check your Java version To test your Java version you can also try to run this simple program import java util public class Java5Test public static void main String args This statement would make no sense to a pre 5 compiler ArrayList String a new ArrayList String a add Alex a add is a add happy This loop construct is also gibberish to a pre 5 compiler for String s a System out println s If it runs successfully you know you have J2SE 5 correctly installed If you see error messages either a you copied or entered the program incorrectly or b your installation of J2SE 5 was not successful in either case you may need to seek additional assistance Running Java programs The procedure for running Java programs is described in detail elsewhere but here is a synopsis Create a file named Java5Test java that contains the program text above You don t want to use a word processor like Word for this you want a text editor that will save the file in plain ASCII text format The program TextEdit that comes with your Mac would do there are other fancier programs that help you with indentation and coloring different parts of the text Save your file in a folder ideally one created just for this program Launch a Terminal window and point it change your directory to the folder where your program is stored Type the command javac Java5Test java to compile your program If it returns silently everything s fine continue to the next step Otherwise you ll see some error messages Use them as a guide to correct your code using your text editor remembering to save the file when you re done Then repeat this step Once your program compiles successfully type the command java Java5Test to run your program You should see some results What else you ll need to know If you re used to the Mac environment and not used to Unix or other command line processing systems you ll want to learn at least a little Unix so you can find your way around Those details are available
