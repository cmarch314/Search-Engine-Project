More generally, any cycle-cutset in a grid can be transformed to a tree-inducing cycle-cutset, no bigger than the origi- nal one. We use this result to improve the known lower bounds on the size of a minimal cycle-cutset in some cases of grids, thus equating the lower bound to the known upper bound. In addition, we present a cycle-cutset driven stochastic local search algorithm in order to approximate the minimal energy of a sum of unary and binary potentials. We show that this method is on-par and even surpasses the state-of-the-art on some grid problems, when both are initialized by elementary means.\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r203a.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8517.0}
