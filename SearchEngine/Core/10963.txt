to calculate the Delaunay triangulation from your set of points and then doing the contour map is pretty easy The Delaunay triangulation will turn your set of points into a surface composed entirely of triangles then you merely need to solve the contour map problem for each triangle in the graph which is fairly straight forward You could then pass it through a bezier curve routine to smooth out the straight lines if you liked Right triangulation is almost always a good idea I m not so sure about the Bezier bit though After all you expect certain things from contours e g you wouldn t really like them to intersect and I don t see how you could guarantee that by applying Bezier routines to a given set of correct piecewise linear contours Martin Martin Ameskamp Inst f Informatik I Computing
