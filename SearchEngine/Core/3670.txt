An underlying assumption of these algorithms\nis that the input points are given precisely. In practice, data is often\ncollected by imperfect methods and hence imprecise, and the validity of\nthe output of these algorithms can be questioned. Still, we often have\nsome information about the imprecision of the points available, such as an\nerror region around each point.\n\nWe investigate what the value of this information is. In this talk, we\nshow how to preprocess a set of disjoint regions in the plane of total\ncomplexity n in O(n log n) time so that if later one point per set is\nspecified with precise coordinates, a triangulation of the points can be\ncomputed in linear time. We also show how to compute the Delaunay\ntriangulation in linear time, but with more restrictions on the shapes of\nthe regions.\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3670.0}
