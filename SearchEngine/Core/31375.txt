Data Characteristics\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2> Data Characteristics</H2>\n<P>\nThis data set is designed for testing indexing schemes in time series\ndatabases. It is a much larger dataset than has been used in any\npublished study (That we are currently aware of). It contains one\nmillion data points. The data has been split into 10 sections to\nfacilitate testing (see below). We recommend building the index with 9\nof the 100,000-datapoint sections, and randomly extracting a query shape\nfrom the 10th section.\n(Some previously published work seems to have used queries that were\nalso used to build the indexing structure. This will produce optimistic\nresults)\nThe data are interesting because they have structure at different\nresolutions. Each of the 10 sections where generated by independent\ninvocations of the function:\n</P>\n<img src=\"equation.gif\" align=\"center\"/>\n<P>\nWhere rand(x) produces a random integer between zero and x.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe data appears highly periodic, but never exactly repeats itself. This\nfeature is designed to challenge the indexing structure. The time series\nare ploted below:\n</P>\n<img src=\"ts1-5.gif\" align=\"center\" width=\"600\"/>\n<img src=\"ts6-10.gif\" align=\"center\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!  Data Format \n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2>Data Format</H2>\n<P>\nThe data is stored in one ASCII file. There are 10 columns, 100,000\nrows. All data points are in the range -0.5 to +0.5.\n</P>\n<P>\nRows are separated by carriage returns, columns by spaces.\n</P>\n\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!
