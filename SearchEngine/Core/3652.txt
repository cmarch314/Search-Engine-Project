In an SCC model, a\ntrusted <i>source</i> outsources a function <i>f</i> to an untrusted\n<i>server</i>, along with a public key for that function. The server\ncan then produce a succinct signature &sigma; vouching for the\ncorrectness of the computation of <i>f</i>, i.e., that some result <i>v</i> is\nindeed the correct outcome of the function <i>f</i> evaluated on some point\n<b>a</b>. Moreover, the signature verification must take\nasymptotically less time than evaluating the function <i>f</i>. We\nconstruct efficient SCC schemes supporting expressive manipulations\nover multivariate polynomials, including polynomial evaluation and\ndifferentiation, and we prove that our constructions are\nadaptively-secure in the random oracle model.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe also show that signatures of correct computation imply\n<i>Publicly Verifiable Computation</i> (PVC), a model recently\nintroduced by the research community. Roughly speaking, in the SCC\nmodel, <i>any client</i> can verify the signature &sigma; and be\nconvinced of some computation result, whereas in the PVC model only\nthe client that issued a query (or anyone who trusts this client) can\nverify that the server returned a valid signature (proof). Our\ntechniques can be readily adapted to construct publicly verifiable\ncomputation schemes with adaptive security and <i>without the\nrandom oracle model</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n(Joint work with Elaine Shi of UC Berkeley and University of Maryland\nand Roberto Tamassia of Brown University)\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3652.0}
