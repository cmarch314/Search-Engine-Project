The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.\n\n\n<p><B> Information files:</B>\n\n<UL>\n  <LI> <a href=\"task.html\">task description</a>.
