The estimator uses the\r\nrecently introduced SampleSearch scheme that is designed to overcome\r\nthe rejection problem associated with distributions having a\r\nsubstantial amount of determinism. We show here that the sampling\r\ndistribution of SampleSearch can be characterized as the backtrack-free\r\ndistribution and propose several schemes for its computation. This\r\nallows integrating SampleSearch into the importance sampling framework\r\nfor approximating the number of solutions and also allows using\r\nSampleSearch for computing a lower bound measure on the number of\r\nsolutions. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our\r\nnew approximate counting schemes against recent competing approaches.</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r142.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8689.0}
