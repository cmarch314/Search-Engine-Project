immigrated in 1888 Some of his children came in with him and others came in before 1891 From what I can determine Rose Waldman and Anna Langsam Katz may have come in together Further work to be done at NARA The last one to arrive was Nathan in 19 with a daughter Pauline Who does not show up on the Ellis Island DataBase but I did find him on the Holland American Database at the NYCPL on microfiche

I found\r\nthree Langsam ladies on the NYC marriage index, but none were Anna. (I do\r\nhave copies of those marriage records)\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Children all born in NY\r\nHarry - 1894 - 1961\r\nIrving - 1896-1962\r\nAgusta (Gussie) 1898-1988\r\nCharles - 1901-1979\r\nMolly Esther - 1903-1996\r\nMorris - 1911-living\r\n=========================================\r\nMorris Waldman (his parents Joseph Waldman & Eva Berger)\r\nHe immigrated in 1888. Some of his children came in with him, and others\r\ncame in before 1891. From what I can determine, Rose Waldman and Anna\r\n(Langsam) Katz may have come in together. Further work to be done at NARA.\r\nThe last one to arrive was Nathan in 1900 with a daughter Pauline. (Who does\r\nnot show up on the Ellis Island DataBase, but I did find him on the Holland\r\nAmerican Database at the NYCPL on microfiche).\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main question about Nathan is, who was he living with in Poland if the\r\nrest of his family was here?   Morris Waldman's headstone alludes to him\r\nbeing a Rabbi. He was not a Rabbi here, but a Kosher wine merchant on\r\nAttorney Street.  Nathan born in Prezworsk, married a women from Krakow, a\r\nReisner, who could also be a Rabbinical Family.  I have always wondered if\r\nNathan was in studies for Rabbinical work, and wasn't very good at it, and\r\nthey threw him out\ufffd.if that is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Children that we know of\ufffd.could have had more in Poland\r\nThe range in DOB's kinda tells me he did have 2 wives and more kids.\r\nLouis - 1862-1910\r\nFanny - 1866-1950\r\nJenny - 1875-1938\r\nNathan - 1876-1944\r\nRose - 1880-1940\r\nMolly - 1885-1944\r\n\r\n\r\nRose Waldman and Anna Langsam were VERY close. From family members who knew\r\nthe ladies, \"these two women were almost inseparable\".  They lived within 2\r\nblocks of each other in the Bronx.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth families lived on the Lower East Side until the mid twenty's and moved\r\n\"en mass\" to the Bronx.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have six photos' I'll be sending to you.  I don't read Hebrew hopefully\r\nyou do. Maybe you can gleen some information from the stones.  Morris\r\nWaldman's stone is hard to read in the photo's.  The fellow who translated\r\nthe stone was not good at it either. I sure would like a good translation\r\nsome day. He is buried at Union Fields Cemetery, Sinavar Cong.

I found a Hersh Mylech, which is a nickname for Tzvi \r\nElimelech. Tzvi in Hebrew means a deer. Hersh is the Yiddish word for deer. He \r\nwas Kanczuga and was known by his middle name, Mylech. He was married to a Goldy, \r\nsurname unknown. For some details, see H2 at\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/reisl-h2.htm\r\nIf they are the same people, then Reisel is the sister of Anna.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the people living next door to the Rich's, please see H13 at\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/efrm-h13.htm\r\n\r\nFurthermore, is your Schoenfeld connected to my tree through his paternal line? \r\nI have MANY Schoenfeld's.
