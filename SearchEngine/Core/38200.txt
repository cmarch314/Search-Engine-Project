section Conclusions 22 3 As computing moves off the desktop and becomes situated in the real world the 4 notion of awareness must also change Current techniques of setting viewing 5 and inferring awareness must change cite PattersonDN 6 3We conducted a user study and subsequent analysis of 447 individuals that use 4instant messaging on mobile computing platforms in order to inform the design of 5an context aware status line prediction tool From this study we are able to 6observe how IM is changing as computing becomes more situated in a wider variety 7of places in the real world Users that are evolving into the new usage 8patterns associated with mobile IM are experiencing several frictions 69 7 cite Fogarty 4 concluded that availability was not enough to mitigate 8 interruptions our results generally agree but it seems clear that the reason is 9 because users are using the desktop practive of leaving messages through IM rather than 1 delaying communication attempts until an appropriate time 1 First users are finding that their personal computers aren t as private as they 11used to be The semi public nature of laptop and cell phone screens in the wild 12is breaking the assumption that a communication buddy can discretely receive an 13IM from a user The result is that a large proportion of our participants had 14been involved in an embarrassing incident while using IM on a semi public 15display The implication for tool design is that revealing information about 16the public or private nature of a user s current context would alleviate some of 17this friction 1118 12 Using the data collected during our study we suggest that fast believable but 13 flexible approaches to status setting based on sensor readings and machine 14 learning techniques would effectively improve contextually appropriate 15 awareness messages 19Next users are treating the virtual desktop as if it is the equivalent 2 of a private stationary physical desktop The practice of leaving IM s for a 21buddy on their screen which they will attend to when they return is no longer 22an appropriate model Instead these messages are distraction enough that users 23are being forced to turn off IM entirely in order to get work done The 24implication for context setting is that the status lines must be believed to be 25accurate by buddies in order for them to mitigate interruptions It is probably 26not sufficient for a tool to take a best guess at a user s current context 27and report it for them automatically If the tool is ever wrong and the buddies 28discover that the status is not accurate they are likely to continue with old 29practices and IM their buddy regardless of what they are reporting on their 3 status line 31 32Thirdly mobile IM users do not have the same degree of attention to devote to 33incoming IMs They are actively using their computers for presentations and 34group work moving around and physically engaged in other tasks Fortunately 35however many of the IMs being sent to our participants were flexible such that 36a well crafted context aware status line could help provide information for 37users to time shift their communication to a more appropriate moment 38 39Custom status prediction form mobile users is largely about activity place and 4 interruption recognition all in one In order for an automatic context tool to 41successfully mirror current user behavior it needs to incorporate aspect of all 42three of these types of active research problems It is unlikely that a tool 43will ever successfully be able to capture all the nuances of place activity or 44interruptibility that a user would like but by addressing all three and 45attempting to communicate them to a buddy list it is more likely that there 46will sufficient information that buddies can make a good decision about how 47what and when to initiate an IM communication 48 49Next the ways in which mobile users are supported in setting their custom 5 status lines must give them the flexibility to describe space in a number of 51semi structured ways It is not sufficient to pick one ontology of space 52descriptions and force the user to describe their place in those terms Users 53must be supported in being able to describe their location in a way that is most 54appropriate for their current position and the composition of their buddy list 55 56Custom status line tools must support the reality that not everything about 57mobile IM is positive A non trivial portion of users are affected by physical threats 58which are associated with the disclosure of their location Furthermore some 59users are obligated to use IM and have less patience for carefully controlling 6 and crafting their presentation of space Both of these types of sensitive users 61need to have the ability to use IM without impacting their safety or requiring 62even more of a obligatory burden 63 64In conclusion mobile IM users are experiencing frictions as they evolve their 65practice from a desktop model The growing situated us of computers and the 66 always online nature of networking is creating new opportunities for 67context aware tools to support user needs Through this study we have 68illuminated where research can be applied to solving some of this emerging 69tensions 7 71 nomatic trunk 2 8 4 4 UBICOMP dis Custom Status tex r96 r961 1515busy

ways based on use and technology Regardless of representation position 127 unambiguously maps where locations are e g 31N 117W 3 miles north of Exit 128 14 on highway I 5 etc Position to place is not a one to one mapping Not 129 only can a position have many place names but a single place name may map to 13 many positions e g home work a Yoshinoya restaurant an IKEA store An 131 excellent discussion of the issues surrounding position and place can be found 132 in cite hightower 3 133 134 item bfseries Activity Activity is also a subjective description of what a 135 person is currently doing Much of the same ambiguity that surrounds place also 136 surrounds activity A person may be walking talking on a cell phone having a 137 conversation laughing exercising looking for the subway all at the same 138 time 139 14 item bfseries Social Situation This is the way in which a person would describe 141 their current activity as it relates to other people It includes situations such as being alone 142 being in a crowd in a meeting on a date etc Again this is a 143 highly subjective way of describing part of a person s context end itemize 144 145 In fact these three elements of context are closely tied together To say that 146 you are at a theater likely means that you are also watching a movie and in a 147 crowd of strangers To say that you are flying to Sydney also implies that you 148 are on a plane So we do not suggest that these three types of context 149 are independent but rather they are different lenses through which we observe 15 situations 151 152 When necessary some of the ambiguity of context can be eliminated by conforming 153 to an ontology hierarchical or otherwise GIS systems such as the U S Census bureau s 154 cite TIGER frequently impose such a structure on 155 the description of places so that each position has exactly one well 156 characterized label perhaps light industrial park or shopping mall 157 Much work in the pervasive and ubiquitous computing community on activity 158 recognition takes this tactic as well Many algorithms are made tractable by 159 the exclusive and unambiguous description of activities in progress e g 16 cite patterson 5 bao2 4 161 162 Nomatic through its mass collaborative nature rejects the imposition of a 163 strict ontology and supports the emergent creation of communal understandings 164 of

172 173 The Human Computer Interaction and Computer Supported Cooperative Work 174 literature has thoroughly documented the value and use of awareness 175 technologies to support and improve distributed group work 176 cite Heath91 Dourish92 Dourish93 Gutwin98 Milewski Tang 1 177 Ethnographic studies of IM have shown that the awareness 178 associated with the online offline status line of an IM client has 179 substantial value in the maintenance dyadic human 18 relationships cite Nardi Nardi 2 Nardi 5 181 182 However the computing context in which IM has been used has been rapidly 183 changing Until recently most users of IM were primarily using desktop 184 computers Computing has changed substantially in recent years such that 185 laptops sales are outpacing desktop computer sales cite laptopsales and IM 186 clients are now available on mobile phones This means that the context 187 provided by a label that says online vs offline is no longer sufficient 188 to provide information to achieve the positive externalities mentioned in 189 Nardi s work cite Nardi 5 Some studies indicate that 13 of all IM 19 dialogue is simply 191 related to negotiating availability cite Handel 2 192 Increasingly individuals are always online 193 The difference is that now a person might be online but not available They 194 may be driving giving a presentation using the same hardware to make a phone 195 call or incur fees to receive IM messages Online no longer means that a 196 user can gracefully handle an interruption 197 198 At the same time this new hardware is being built

Unlike previous IM clients this 22 one reports more nuanced context information in the status line see figure 221 fig screenshots 2 When a user 222 sets their context information their position is simultaneously queried from 223 the Place Lab system These two pieces of information are then alternately 224 reported on the awareness status line The information is also anonymized and 225 sent to
