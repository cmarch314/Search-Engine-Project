Our approach is to use\napplication generators targeted for the domain of graph-representation-based\ntesting and analysis tools.  Moreover, we generate the generators themselves,\nso that the development of tools based on different languages and/or\nrepresentations can also be supported better.  In this paper we report on our\nexperiences in developing a system called Aria that generates testing and\nanalysis tools based on an abstract semantics graph representation for C and\nC++ called Reprise.  Aria itself was generated by the Genoa system.  We\ndemonstrate the utility of Aria and, thereby, the power of our approach, by\nshowing Aria's use in the development of a tool that derives control\ndependence graphs directly from Reprise abstract semantics graphs.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:19:55 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 26113.0}
