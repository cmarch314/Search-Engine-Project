In this talk I will go over cryptographic\ntools that provide secure constructions in a particular model of delegation,\nthat can accommodate various classes of functions. As an example, I will\npresent in detail our recent result  for the case of multi-dimensional range\nqueries that  appeared in ACM CCS'14 (joint work with Stavros Papadopoulos\nfrom Intel and MIT and Nikos Triandopoulos from RSA Laboratories & Boston\nUniversity).\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 8713.0}
