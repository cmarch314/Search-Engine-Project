The overall grade\nwill be determined 40% from homework, 20% from the midterm, and\n40% from the final.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted, but each student must\nlist his or her collaborators in writing for each problem. If a\nstudent\nturns in a solution without listing the others who helped produce\nthis\nsolution, this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Exam policy.</b>\nExam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration\nis allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams will be\nconsidered cheating.\nIn addition to the procedures of the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html\">ICS \nCheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a \nfailing grade in the class.\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Texts.</b> \n<ul>\n<li>\nKleinberg and Tardos, <cite>Algorithm Design</cite>, Addison-Wesley, 2005.\n<li>\nMitzenmacher and Upfal, Probability and Computing: Randomized\nAlgorithms and Probabilistic Analysis, Cambridge Univ.
