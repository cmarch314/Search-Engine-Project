Chapter Three\ndiscusses software uncertainty in detail, including \nsources of uncertainty and uncertainty in development\nphases.\nIn Chapter Four we present an uncertainty modeling\ntechnique called Bayesian Belief Networks and justify\nits applicability to software engineering situations.\nSeveral examples of Bayesian networks are included.\nChapter Five describes the architecture and components\nof the CEquencer system, selected as case study for\nthis dissertation.  In Chapter Six we present results\nand impressions from our study of uncertainty modeling\nat Beckman.  Chapter Seven describes three specific\napplications of Bayesian networks in practice as well\nas related work in uncertainty modeling.  Finally,\nChapter Eight presents conclusions and future work.\n<P>\nIn conclusion of the introduction, we wish to point out\nthat uncertainty abounds not only in software development\nbut also in most engineering and scientific pursuits\nas well as many everyday situations (For uncertainty in\neveryday situations see, for example, Stefik&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#StefikKBSE\">Ste95</A>],\npp. 460.).  Detailed exploration of uncertainty in general\nis, therefore, beyond the scope of this dissertation.\nNevertheless, we hope that the maxims, techniques, tools,\nand results described here will help identify research\nopportunities as well as provide a solid foundation for\nfuture work in software uncertainty modeling.  We\nencourage readers to consider occurrences and consequences\nof uncertainty in their own domains of interest and expertise.\nOur future plans include additional modeling of software\nuncertainties at Beckman as well as exploring other domains\nwhere uncertainty modeling may be useful.  We are particularly\ninterested in ``Bayesian Internets,'' i.e., the modeling of\ninformation retrieval uncertainties on the Internet and WWW.\n<P>\n <HR><A NAME=\"tex2html60\" HREF=\"node6.html\"><IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"next\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/next_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html58\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"up\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/up_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html54\" HREF=\"node4.html\"><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"previous\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/previous_motif.gif\"></A>   <BR>\n<B> Next:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html61\" HREF=\"node6.html\">References</A>\n<B>Up:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html59\" HREF=\"node1.html\">Introduction</A>\n<B> Previous:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html55\" HREF=\"node4.html\">Dissertation Contributions</A>\n<P><ADDRESS>\n<I>Hadar Ziv <BR>\nFri Jun 20 16:22:31 PDT 1997</I>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 4805.0}
