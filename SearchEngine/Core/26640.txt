computer based systems However managing controlling developing and assessing the development of software intensive systems are complex and error prone tasks that are made even more difficult by the lack of meaning ful data on key products and processes Such data should provide visibility into the health and status of the evolving software system assist in early identification of current and potential problem areas and aid in predicting such software system characteristics as reliability maintainability cost and schedule Additionally such data are essential to process improvement activities since they provide a means for quantifying process characteristics and assessing changes both improvements and degradations in these characteristics To enable software system metrics to provide real data for the purposes mentioned above comprehensive data collection and analysis methods which treat software as an integral part of a larger system are needed This presentation introduces a software system metrics approach that has been developed for this purpose The presentation discusses the utility of the approach introduces a set of recommended metrics that covers both

However, managing,\n controlling, developing, and assessing the development of software-intensive \nsystems are complex \nand error-prone tasks that are made even more difficult by the lack of meaning\nful data on key products and processes. Such data \nshould provide visibility into the health and status of the evolving software \nsystem, assist in early identification of current and\npotential problem areas, and aid in predicting such software system \ncharacteristics as reliability, maintainability, cost, and schedule. \nAdditionally, such data are essential to process improvement activities, \nsince they provide a means for quantifying process \ncharacteristics and assessing changes - both improvements and degradations - \nin these characteristics.\n\n<p>\n\nTo enable software system metrics to provide real data for the purposes \nmentioned above, comprehensive data collection and analysis methods which \ntreat software as an integral part of a larger system are needed. This \npresentation introduces a software system metrics approach that has been \ndeveloped for this purpose. The presentation discusses the utility of the \napproach, introduces a set of \nrecommended metrics that covers both the system and the software throughout \nthe life cycle, and provides some examples of these \nin the area of metrics for requirements. Next, key concepts and planning \nguidelines for metrics programs are highlighted and the \nrelationship of metrics to process improvement is addressed. The presentation \nconcludes by identifying some current topics in metrics and some sources of \nadditional information.\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\nRita Costello Creel is an Engineering Specialist in the Software Engineering \nSubdivision at the Aerospace Corporation, where she supports acquisition and \nanalysis activities for large, software-intensive systems.
