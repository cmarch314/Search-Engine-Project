The choice of projects can be very open-ended; ideally you can incorporate their own research. But your class project must be about new things you have done this semester; you can't use results you have developed in previous semesters. People can work individually or in teams of two.\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <h2> Grading </h2>\n\n    <p> <b> Project Proposal (due 11/13 2:00pm in EEE dropbox) 10% of project grade</b>\n    <br> The proposal should include a title, roughly 2 paragraphs describing the project idea, and a list of 1-3 relevant papers. If you will be collecting your own images, describe any special experimental procedure (restriction of illumination conditions, the use of projectors, etc.). If we do not have the facilities here, you may be able to email authors of a paper for their collected data. If you will be using a standard image dataset, include a pointer to it.\n      \n    <p> <b> Final Writeup (due 12/10, 1:30 pm in EEE dropbox) 60% of project grade</b>\n    <br> You must prepare a writeup using the given <a href=\"cvpr.zip\">CVPR</a> format. There is a strict page limit of 8 pages including references. A single writeup is required per project.\n\n    <p> <b> Presentation (on 12/10, 1:30-3:30 pm) 30% of project grade.</b>\n    <br>You must prepare a presentation with a strict time limit of 10 minutes. \n\n    <hr>\n\n    <h2> Ideas </h2>\n\n    You are strongly encouraged to find a project aligned with their own research interests.
