Japanese art of paper folding is obviously geometrical in nature.\nSome origami masters have looked at constructing geometric figures such\nas regular polyhedra from paper.  In the other direction, some people have\nbegun using computers to help fold more traditional origami\ndesigns.  This idea works best for tree-like structures, which can be\nformed by laying out the tree onto a paper square so that the vertices\nare well separated from each other, allowing room to fold up the\nremaining paper away from the tree.  Bern and Hayes (SODA 1996) asked,\ngiven a pattern of creases on a square piece of paper, whether one can\nfind a way of folding the paper along those creases to form a flat\norigami shape; they showed this to be NP-complete.  Related theoretical\nquestions include how many different ways a given pattern of creases\ncan be folded, whether folding a flat polygon from a square always\ndecreases the perimeter, and whether it is always possible to fold a\nsquare piece of paper so that it forms (a small copy of) a given flat\npolygon.\n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www1.zetosa.com.pl/~burczyk/origami/galery1-en.htm\">Krystyna Burczyk's Origami Gallery - regular polyhedra</A>.\n<P>\n<li><a href=\"http://world.std.com/~j9/sponge/\">The business card Menger\nsponge project</a>.
