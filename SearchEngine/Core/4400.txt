the end of the quarter there will be an extra day long session with student presentations either on Dec 2 Thursday Dec 3 Friday or Dec 4 Saturday to be decided in the first week Each presentation will be 2 minutes long You will be expected to listen to the talks of all the other students but you will be excused from the part of the talks that conflicts with your other obligations on that day The class is open to upper class undergraduates with the permission of the instructor The requirements for the undergraduates are reduced For example no final presentation is required see more below Class

edition Main reading material Handouts lecture notes and other material available on line see a link below Office hours Monday 3 5 and otherwise by appointment I encourage you to use the office hours and also to communicate with me by email at stasio ics uci edu Most important info Lecture summaries lecture notes problem sets solutions other handouts Reference reading material Course Description This course is an introduction to modern cryptography and security for graduates and advanced undergraduates The class will try to balance between the breadth of the coverage and an attempt to develop a general approach to the study of security issues The first aim of the class is to introduce students to various cryptographic tools like symmetric and public key encryption schemes signature schemes message authentication schemes identification protocols and others The second and equally important aim of this class is to develop a provable security paradigm of approaching any communication security problem This paradigm consists of 1 understanding the security goal of any protocol i e understanding what properties a protocol needs to achieve to be considered secure and 2 designing a protocol together with a proof that the protocol achieves these properties under some well understood computational hardness assumptions for example under the assumption that it is computationally hard to factor large composite numbers The aim of the course is to introduce some fundamental cryptographic tools in such a way so that 1 you will be able to specify the security needs of the system you are designing and use existing cryptographic mechanisms in such a way so that your security needs are met and 2 you will be able to develop new cryptographic mechanisms and protocols yourself To help further these goals we ll end the class with conference style presentations by the graduate students on some security cryptography topic chosen by the student What this class is not about This class will not teach you all there is to know to make computers and networks secure Cryptography is only one layer in the stack of engineering issues that need to be solved to make computers and networks secure Computer security deals with lots of issues we will not touch on in the class like buggy code viruses denial of service attacks network monitoring techniques preventing bad passwords integrating various network services securely and many more This class will stay firmly on the layer of algorithms for the so called cryptographic primitives i e the design of cryptographic tools like encryption signatures authentication While some of these tools will be probably very useful in solving any of the real world security issues above we will not be analyzing any such systems in this class On the other hand we will often mention the real world security issues like those listed above in motivating the security properties required of the cryptographic tools we will be designing Another note of warning is that in this class we will not concentrate on techniques used to design and analyze block ciphers like DES or AES and hash functions like MD5 and SHA although the class will offer you some insight into security of such constructions We will focus instead on public key crypto but we will spend a few lectures on private key algorithms too Grading policy Graduates 5 weekly problem sets 25 take home final 25 a 3 minute conference style presentation on a security cryptography topic of your choice the presentations will take place in a a special class depending on the number of students involved Undergraduates 7 weekly problem sets 3 take home final Problem sets are due at the beginning of the class You are not allowed to work on the homework problems together with other students You are also not allowed to consult solutions from previous years or solutions available on line You are allowed to consult other sources such as textbooks lecture notes or research papers but you must clearly mark any material you reference Textbook and lecture notes The recommended textbook is Douglas R Stinson s Cryptography Theory and Practice which is available through the UCI bookstore It is very good as a reference for a lot of the material we will be covering but we will not follow it in great detail and a lot of the lecture material is not covered by Stinson The primary source of the material will be the lecture notes and handouts which I will be posting on the web and distributing in class Prerequisites The formal prerequisites are ICS 6 A and ICS 161 However what you really need in general is this You cannot be math phobic or theory phobic The major focus of this class is on definitions and proofs and we ll use probability and number theory in the running time analysis and the security analysis of the algorithms we will study More specifically you need the following You should be comfortable with proofs with elementary probability and have the basic knowledge of discrete math used in computer science e g ICS 6A It s highly recommended that you have some algorithms class like ICS 161 and that you are familiar with asymptotic analysis of algorithm running time It d be also easier for you if you took a computability complexity class like ICS 162 so you are familiar with the notion of polynomial time algorithms and the notion of a reduction between computational problems However this is material which we ll go over in this class to the extend that we ll use it and I believe that you can pick it up easily You do not have to know modular arithmetic because we will review everything we will need However familiarity with it will be helpful If you want to learn modular arithmetic on a deeper level consider the MATH 173A class taught every fall quarter by prof Caryl Margulies in the math department see also below Other UCI classes on cryptography This class is complimentary to the MATH 173A 173B classes on number theory and cryptography which are taught by Prof Margulies in the math department Having that class or any other preparation in number theory is a very good background for this class but it is not necessary However if you think you d like to work on cryptography and security and you do not have a strong background in number theory I recommend that you take both classes this quarter Prof Margulie s class is taught MWF 3 3 5 in ET 2 4 and the ICS students can either take it for a grade or pass fail as a special topic course ICS 299 Security Seminar Announcement Students who want to learn more about crypto security are encouraged to attend a weekly seminar of the SCONCE group which takes place on Fridays 11 3 12 3 in ICS2 room 144 ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/fall04/ics268.html",
