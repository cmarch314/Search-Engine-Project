There are a number of packages which Chimera 2.0 uses \nin order to perform.  These packages should \nbe in your CLASSPATH.  Your CLASSPATH should end up including:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>the path to swing 1.0.1 (See <A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">\n\tPreparing your System for Chimera </A>)\n\t<br>\n\tNote: swing 1.0.1 is included in JFC 1.1 which is included in JDK 1.2 beta 3.\n\n    <li>the path to JSDK 1.0.1 (See <A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">\n\tPreparing your System for Chimera </A>)\n\t<br>\n\tNote: swing and JSDK are included in JDK 1.2.\n\n    <li>the path to HTTPClient 0.3 (See <A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">\n\tPreparing your System for Chimera </A>)\n\n    <li>the path to Rivendell 0.6 (See <A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">\n\tPreparing your System for Chimera </A>)\n\n    <li>the path to MSXML 1.8 (See <A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">\n\tPreparing your System for Chimera </A>)\n\n    <br>&nbsp;\n\n    <li>the path to chimera2b2.jar\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nNote: The example below uses the tcsh shell.\n</p>\n\n<H4>Setting the CLASSPATH to chimera2b2.jar</H4>\n\n<p> There are a number of commands you can use to append your environment \nvariable.  To set the CLASSPATH variable to include the path to chimera.jar,\nyou may use any technique which will append the path to chimera.jar to\nyour CLASSPATH.  The following is one way you could change your CLASSPATH.\n</p>\n\n<p> You should have your chimera2b2.jar file somewhere you have access to it.\nIn the screen-shot below, the file is in the directory /home/yuzok/classes\non the testor's machine.\n</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/location_chimera.gif\" WIDTH=\"435\"\nHEIGHT=\"175\"></CENTER>\n\n<p> You can use the setenv command in the following way when you\nwant to append to the CLASSPATH value. The command will look like this:\n<br>\n<tt>setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH':<i>path_to_chimera.jar</i>'</tt>\n<br>\nNote: For tcsh, the two ' are needed to quote the colon symbol : which\nwould otherwise be interpreted by the tcsh shell.\nThe meaning of the command is -- set CLASSPATH to the previous \nvalue of CLASSPATH plus all\nthe characters from the first ' to the last '.\nThe screen-shot below displays the appending using setenv command.\n</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/chimera_in_classpath.gif\" WIDTH=\"675\"\nHEIGHT=\"97\"></CENTER>\n\n\n<p> You now have the chimera2b2.jar file for Chimera 2.0 in the \nCLASSPATH.
