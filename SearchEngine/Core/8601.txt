This has prompted many researchers \r\nto use approximations on the bounds of sets of intervals,\r\nresulting in sound, but incomplete, algorithms.\r\nWe delineate the complexity of propagation of sets of intervals through\r\narithmetic constraints. For many types of constraint networks, our analysis \r\nshows linear, rather than exponential, complexity bounds. Furthermore, \r\nexponential complexity is a worst-case scenario that is surprisingly \r\nhard to achieve. In some cases, the number of disjoint intervals in\r\nthe output of an acyclic constraint satisfaction problem is independent\r\nof the number of disjoint intervals in the input.\r\nSome empirical results are presented, showing that the worst-case\r\nbound is not achieved for random intervals.</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r76-complexityinterval_based.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r76-complexityinterval_based.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8601.0}
