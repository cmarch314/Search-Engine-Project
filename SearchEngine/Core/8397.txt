Such algorithms (e.g., clustering, conditioning) are\r\neffective only if the problem has a sparse graph captured by parameters such as tree\r\nwidth and cycle-cutset size. In this paper we initiate a study to determine the potential of\r\nstructure-based algorithms in real-life applications. We analyze empirically the \r\nstructural properties of problems coming from the circuit diagnosis domain. Speciffically,\r\nwe locate those properties that capture the effectiveness of clustering and conditioning as \r\nwell as of a family of conditioning+clustering algorithms designed to gradually trade space\r\nfor time. We perform our analysis on 11 benchmark circuits widely used in the testing \r\ncommunity. We also report on the effect of ordering heuristics on tree-clustering\r\nand show that, on our benchmarks, the well known max-cardinality ordering is \r\nsubstantially inferior to an ordering called min-degree.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"prob-reasn-benchmark-circuits.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"prob-reasn-benchmark-circuits.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8397.0}
