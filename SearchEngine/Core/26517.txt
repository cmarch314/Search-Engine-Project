no doubt seen in previous coursework how to iterate over the elements of a list in Python using a for loop For example given a list of integers you could use the following function to calculate the sum of all of the integers in the list You could also use the built in sum function but let s look at the detailed pattern the nice thing about understanding the underlying pattern is that you can use the pattern to solve similar problems for which there aren t built in solutions like sum sum numbers1 py def sum numbers numlist int int Adds up the integers in a list of integers sum for num in numlist sum num return sum Now suppose we change the problem just slightly so that we instead are given a list containing lists of integers always two levels of depth but maintain the same goal of summing all of the integers Our function changes somewhat because we need to handle the additional level of depth we need to loop over the sublists in the list then loop over the integers in the sublists sum numbers2 py def sum numbers numlist int int Adds up the integers in a list of lists of integers sum for sublist in numlist for num in sublist sum num return sum So far so good We can still solve the problem using tools we already have though we did have to nest the for loops so things have gotten a bit more complicated But one thing to notice is that the structure of the code follows the structure of the data we re dealing with the list is two levels deep and the loops are nested two levels deep This is more common than you might think To add one final twist to the problem now let s assume we want to sum the numbers in a list whose elements are either integers or lists of integers so in total no more than two levels of depth We can add the appropriate condition to our function to handle this case which requires only that we know that the function type x returns the type of the object x and that we can compare types using to see if they re the same that s a tool we could use to differentiate between the elements of the list that are integers and the elements that are lists sum numbers3 py def sum numbers numlist int or int int Adds up the integers in a list whose elements are either integers or lists of integers sum for element in numlist if type element list for num in element sum num else sum element return sum As in the previous two examples the structure of the code is still matching the structure of the data we re dealing with Unconstraining the problem Imagine now what you might need to do to our function in order to be able to sum the numbers in a list like this one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 What s different about this list is that it is three levels deep there is a list containing a list that contains another list Even the most complex of the three functions above is constrained to the problem of summing lists that might be up to two levels deep Using the strategy above supporting a third level of depth would require another level of nesting in our function the innermost for loop would need to contain another if statement to check the type of the elements in each sublist and yet another for loop inside that to loop over the elements of the third level sublist You could indeed solve the problem this way but it wouldn t support four levels without a fourth level of nesting in the code And then a fifth level of nesting in the list would require a fifth level of nesting in the code And no matter how much patience you have in writing a function that s more deeply nested there is a list that is potentially deeper than that But what if we unconstrain the problem altogether Consider the following definition of a data structure A nested list of integers is a list in which every element is either an integera nested list of integers This data structure is recursive it is included in its own definition Inside of nested lists of integers can be smaller nested lists of integers inside of which can be smaller ones still and so on Why this nesting does not continue forever is because we have a base case our definition allows us to have a nested list of integers that contains only integers but no more nested lists inside A function that can sum the numbers in a nested list of integers is the generalization of the three functions we wrote above It would handle all of the cases those three functions handle plus any other combination of nesting that is possible In order to achieve that generalization however we need to embrace a new concept a recursive function The code The final code example from lecture in which we summed the integers in a nested list of integers is below The sum recursive module The moral Some programming languages encourage recursion as a primary form of repetition i e if you need to do something repeatedly you tend to want to use recursion above all else Python is not one of them however in Python your first inclination should be to use loops to solve problems of repetition However what you soon discover is that not all problems lead to a well formulated solution this way Particularly when you start wanting to iterate through recursive data structures like our nested list of integers here you find that no combination of nested loops will ever solve your entire problem No matter how deeply you nest your loops you can find an input that nests more deeply than your loops do When you find yourself in that situation recursion offers an approach that will lead to a general solution Why this is of particular interest in the context of Project 1 is because a file system is a recursive data structure Directories contain collections of files and other directories which in turn contain collections of files and other directories and so on You ll find the technique of using recursion very useful in traversing the file system and searching for files in directory structures that could be deeply nested On the other hand you don t want to take this new knowledge too far using recursion in situations for which it s not an appropriate solution in Python For example in Project 1 you ll need to repeatedly ask for a line of input until a valid one is given This kind of repetition is much better implemented in Python using a loop In general your inclination should be to use loops whenever you can and recursion when you must And you should also bear in mind that this is not necessarily the same decision you would make if you were programming in a language other than Python But we re programming in Python so we should use the techniques that are most appropriate for that language we should prefer loops and use recursion only when we need it ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics32/CodeExamples/Recursion/", "title": "ics 32 winter
