DFA starts in it ends up after the input in a known state These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion planning problems in fact the conference version of this paper used the title Reset sequences for finite automata with application to design of parts orienters and also in coding theory where they arise in the design of self synchronizing codes This paper considers DFAs in which the transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states and shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly It also considers parallel algorithms for the

paths in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage dominated by a single source shortest path computation The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph where k is a parameter given as input to the algorithm The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems network routing hypothesis generation in computational linguistics and sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in bioinformatics Although there have been many papers on the k shortest paths problem before and after this one it has become frequently cited in those application areas Additionally it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could be

that the number of crossing pairs of line segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated log factor then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear time It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated log factor so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
