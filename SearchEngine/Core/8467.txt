In this paper we show however that anytime Best-First algorithms recently developed for path-finding problems, can fare well when applied to graphical models. Specifically, we augment best-first schemes designed for graphical models with such anytime capabilities and demonstrate their potential when compared against one of the most competitive depth-first branch and bound scheme. Though Best-First search using weighted heuristics is successfully used in many domains, the crucial question of weight parameter choice has not been systematically studied and presents an interesting machine learning problem.\r\n</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r201.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8467.0}
