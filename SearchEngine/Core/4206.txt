Informatics DEGREES AVAILABLE Major and Minor What is Informatics Informatics brings together software engineering human computer interaction and the study of information technology in organizations into a single focused degree program Informatics addresses the design and construction of information technology systems that will be effective in real world situations It includes not only building software but also examining the human organizational and social context where the system will be used Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design implementation use and impact of information technology Informatics is a common term for computer science in European universities the number of Informatics programs in American universities is growing Traditional computer science programs focus on analyzing and designing computers and computer systems but the success of those systems depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on the real world situations where they will be used the human users and their requirements characteristics and organizations Informatics studies computer systems in their real world context and how to design and build those systems so they work effectively in that context In Informatics we aim to Design and develop new uses for information technology Understand the effect information technology has on people Apply information technology in fields ranging from medicine to music from ecology to aerospace from finance to entertainment Is Informatics for me What do I take What can I do with this degree What can I do with the Informatics minor Still not sure Is Informatics for me Informatics is for you if you Enjoy solving problems using all the tools you have available Can work not only with technical details but also with big picture issues Have strong reading and writing skills and can think freely creatively and systematically Previous experience in computer programming is not required to start the Informatics major Programming is just one aspect of Informatics and the major introduces all the necessary skills at a manageable pace Students who do already have some programming experience will also find new concepts even in the very first course The Informatics major offers a contemporary curriculum with an emphasis on group work starting in the first course studio oriented design courses and a year long senior project The first year of the program provides students with a hands on introduction to the broad field of Informatics centering on the Informatics Core Course This year long course develops students basic understanding of software how to design and construct programs and how the programs operate as part of information technology systems The second year builds up a portfolio of foundational concepts and techniques that establish the discipline of Informatics these contribute to the toolbox students will use in subsequent years to solve large scale information and software design problems As sophomores students begin to take more advanced courses that support their specialization in either software engineering human computer interaction or the study of organizations and information technology These may involve courses in Management Psychology Computer Science or Engineering In the third year all students study the design process project management and the impacts of technology on the real world Students continue to take electives in their specialized area of study The fourth year is built around a year long capstone project in which groups of students address a significant project typically from an outside client Back to top What do I take All Informatics majors take a common core of 16 courses After their first year Informatics majors choose an additional 1 courses in one of three specializations Software EngineeringHuman Computer InteractionOrganizations and Information Technology For a full listing of courses required for the major see the General Catalogue Students are encouraged to consult an academic advisor in the Bren School of ICS to determine the coursework designed to meet their educational goals Additional information about this degree can be found on the Department of Informatics web site Back to top What can I do with this degree A degree in Informatics provides excellent preparation for work at the forefront of the computing industry Our students work in many industrial settings such as start up companies small software houses consulting firms and multi national corporations They are prepared for careers including these Software EngineerHuman Computer Interface DesignerInformation ArchitectGame DesignerUsability EngineerMobile Computing Systems Designer Many students will go on to graduate school in computer engineering computer science information science management or law Back to top What can I do with the Informatics Minor The minor provides a focused study of Informatics to supplement a student s major program of study and prepares students for a profession career or academic pursuit in which information and software design is an integral part but is not the primary focus The minor allows students sufficient flexibility to pursue courses that complement their major field or address specific interests The minor particularly centers on understanding the relationships among computers and people and how these relationships must be addressed in information and software design Requirements for the Informatics minor can be found in the General Catalogue

It includes not only building software but also examining \nthe human, organizational, and social context where the system will be \nused. </li>\n<br/>\n<li>Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, \nimplementation, use, and impact of information technology.</li>\n<br/>\n<li>Informatics is a common term for computer science in \nEuropean universities; the number of Informatics programs in American \nuniversities is growing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traditional computer science programs focus on analyzing and \ndesigning computers and computer systems, but the success of those \nsystems depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on \nthe real-world situations where they will be used&#8212;the human users and \ntheir requirements, characteristics, and organizations. Informatics \nstudies computer systems in their real-world context and how to design \nand build those systems so they work effectively in that context. </p>\n<p>In Informatics we aim to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and develop new uses for information technology.</li>\n<li>Understand the effect information technology has on \npeople.</li>\n<li>Apply information technology in fields ranging from \nmedicine to music, from ecology to aerospace, from finance to \nentertainment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><cite>&#8250; <a href=\"degree_in4matx.php#uci\">Is \nInformatics for me?</a><br/>\n\t\t        &#8250; <a href=\"degree_in4matx.php#get\">What \ndo I take?</a><br/>\n\t\t        &#8250; <a href=\"degree_in4matx.php#what\">What\n can I do with this degree?</a><br/>\n\t\t        &#8250; <a href=\"degree_in4matx.php#minor\">What\n can I do with the Informatics minor?</a><br/>\n\t\t        &#8250; <a href=\"degree_in4matx.php#visit\">Still\n not sure? </a></cite> \n\t          </p>\n<p> <a name=\"uci\"></a> </p>\n<h4>Is Informatics for me? </h4>\n<p>Informatics is for you if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy solving problems using all the tools you have available.</li>\n<br/>\n<li>Can work not only with technical details but also with \n&#8220;big-picture&#8221; issues</li>\n<br/>\n<li>Have strong reading and writing skills and can think freely, \ncreatively, and systematically.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous experience in computer programming is not required to \nstart the Informatics major. Programming is just one aspect of \nInformatics and the major introduces all the necessary skills at a \nmanageable pace. Students who do already have some programming \nexperience will also find new concepts, even in the very first course. </p>\n<p>The Informatics major offers a contemporary curriculum with an \nemphasis on group work (starting in the first course), studio-oriented \ndesign courses, and a year-long senior project.</p>\n<p>The first year of the program provides students with a hands-on \nintroduction to the broad field of Informatics, centering on the \nInformatics Core Course. This year-long course develops students&#8217; basic \nunderstanding of software: how to design and construct programs and how \nthe programs operate as part of information technology systems.</p>\n<p>The second year builds up a portfolio of foundational concepts \nand techniques that establish the discipline of Informatics; these \ncontribute to the &#8220;toolbox&#8221; students will use in subsequent years to \nsolve large-scale information and software design problems.  As \nsophomores, students begin to take more advanced courses that support \ntheir specialization in either software engineering, human-computer \ninteraction, or the study of organizations and information technology. \nThese may involve courses in Management, Psychology, Computer Science, \nor Engineering.</p>\n<p>In the third year, all students study the design process, \nproject management, and the impacts of technology on the real world. \nStudents continue to take electives in their specialized area of study.</p>\n<p>The fourth year is built around a year-long capstone project in \nwhich groups of students address a significant project, typically from \nan outside client.</p>\n<p>&#8593; <a href=\"degree_in4matx.php#startcontent\">Back\n to top</a></p>\n<a name=\"get\"></a>\n<h4>What do I take? </h4>\n<p>All Informatics majors take a common core of 16 \ncourses.
