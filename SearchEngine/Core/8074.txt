In these systems, users may experience difficulties \n          finding the entities they are looking for if they do not know their \n          exact spelling, such as the name of a restaurant. In this paper, we \n          present a solution to support fuzzy keyword search on spatial data. \n          We combine a spatial index structure with inverted indexes on grams \n          to efficiently answer fuzzy queries on maps. We show two system \n          prototypes to demonstrate the practicality of our solution.</p> \n\t  <div class=\"break\"></div>\n          <h2>Publications</h2>\n          <ul> \n\t    <li><b>Supporting Location-Based Approximate-Keyword Queries,</b> Sattam Alsubaiee, Alexander Behm, and Chen Li, ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2010. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~salsubai/pub/gis2010-LBAKTree.pdf\">[PDF]</a> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~salsubai/pub/Alsubaiee_GIS2010_LBAK-Tree.pptx\"/>[PPT]</a> <a href=\"http://flamingo.ics.uci.edu/releases/latest/\">[Source Code]</a>\n            <li><b>Fuzzy Keyword Search on Spatial Data,</b> \n              Sattam Alsubaiee, Chen Li, DASFAA 2010 (demo paper) <font color=#ff0000>(Excellent Demo Award)</font>\n              <a href=\"/localsearch/fuzzysearch/pub/dasfaa10-alsubaiee.pdf\">[PDF]</a> \n          </ul> \n          <div class=\"break\"></div> \n          <h2>Demos</h2> \n          <p>We used two real datasets to develop two prototypes for demonstration:</p> \n          <ul> \n            <li><a href=\"http://jujube.ics.uci.edu/localsearch/fuzzysearch/flickrdemo/\">Demo</a> \n            on the <a href=\"http://cophir.isti.cnr.it/\">CoPhIR</a> dataset which \n            is a multimedia metadata collection extracted from Flickr pages.\n            <li><a href=\"http://jujube.ics.uci.edu/localsearch/fuzzysearch/geonamesdemo/\">Demo</a> \n            using the <a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\">GeoNames</a> geographical \n            database which contains geographical objects such as lakes and hills.\n          </ul>\n<div class=\"break\"></div> \n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3> \n<p>This study is supported by NSF award No. <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0742960\">IIS-0742960</a> , as well as a Google Research Award and a gift fund from Microsoft.\n</p> \n          <div class=\"break\"></div> \n          <div>For questions about this work, please\n            contact <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~salsubai/\">Sattam Alsubaiee.</a> \n          </div> \n        </div> \n\t<br/>\n\t\n\t<br/>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 8074.0}
