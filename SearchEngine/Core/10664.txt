This paper introduces the diameter treewidth property later known as bounded local treewidth a functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth Previously known results imply that planar graphs have bounded local treewidth we characterize the other minor closed families with this property Specifically minor closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there exists an apex graph G that is not in F an apex graph is a graph that can be made planar by removing a single vertex The minor free families that exclude an apex graph and therefore have bounded local treewidth include the bounded genus graphs for which as with planar graphs we show a linear bound for the treewidth as a function of the diameter and K3 a free graphs As a consequence subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and approximations to several NP hard optimization problems can be computed efficiently on these graphs extending previous results for planar graphs Some of these results were announced in the conference version of subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related problems but not included in the journal version Since its publication there have been many more works on local treewidth The class of problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe Deciding first order properties of locally tree decomposable structures J ACM 48 1184 12 6 2 1 the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an excluded apex minor was simplified and the dependence of the treewidth on

Specifically,\nminor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there\nexists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph\nthat can be made planar by removing a single vertex.\nThe minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have\nbounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus\ngraphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the\ntreewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As\na consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and\napproximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed\nefficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar\ngraphs.\n<p>Some of these results\nwere announced in the conference version of\n\"<a href=\"p-psgi.html\">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related\nproblems</a>\" but not included in the journal version. Since its\npublication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of\nproblems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local\ntreewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, \"<a\nhref=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504794.504798\">Deciding first-order\nproperties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>\", <i>J.

Previously superpatterns had\nbeen considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this\nto sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that\nthe 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the\nknown bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation\nsubclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.\nWe apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets\nof points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex\nplanar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct\nuniversal sets of size approximately <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4,\nand we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded\npathwidth.\n<p>\n<li><b>Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play\nplanarity</b>.<br>\nD.

We define a variant of\nconfluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path\nbetween two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.\nWe show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,\nin contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.\nAdditionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points\nare on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed\ncyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.\nWe use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which\nall tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.\n<p>\n<li><b>Planar induced subgraphs of sparse graphs</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/\">G.
