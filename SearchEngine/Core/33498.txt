in many ways In fact some people have amazing ability to make deep impression on many people C K Prahalad was one of those remarkable people I was very lucky to enjoy very close friendship with him and his family for about 15 years from 1985 to around 2 1 We met maybe in 1983 when we both arrived at University of Michigan We were in different colleges he in Business and I in Engineering but met at a mutual friend s Ila and Jagadish house in a party During conversations I was attracted to his keen and deep intellect and great sense of humor We met several times because we lived in very close neighborhood My friendship grew with him and was strengthened significantly in early 9 s when I got involved in starting companies and approached him to be an advisor After a few year we started working on a project together that became a company called Praja I had moved to San Diego and Praja started in San Diego CK also decided to move with his family to San Diego to build Praja Much of 9 s was the period when I learnt a lot from CK on many fronts In early 2 1 due to the internet bust Praja went through difficult period and was later sold to Tibco Then I moved to Atlanta and later to Irvine We met much less frequently after that CK was one of the boldest thinkers I met and worked with He was not afraid to think contrary to current wisdom in fact most times he started from that position He was not afraid to express his thoughts to anybody and I mean anybody On the other hand he was one of the most friendly and warm persons For several years I felt that I had an elder brother to guide me and he and his family cared for us exactly like that He was very generous with his time and resources His taste for every thing was absolutely the top most whether in intellectual things wine food or any other material things or art He did not settle for anything that he did not consider the top quality Another very unique thing about CK Gayatri Murali and Deepa was and remains their sense of humor When with them you are always laughing Their ability to see the lighter side in things is remarkable Yesterday when I read in Newspaper about his passing away I was in a daze for quite some time When I told Sudha she started shouting and crying She was able to call Gayatri and talk to her About 3 hours after knowing that he has left this world I am still in a shock The time spent with him and his family is going through my memories and I am reliving many of those moments vividly CK was one of those people who may not be with you but his memories are so vivid that you feel that he is with you Moreover what I learnt from him and that is more than possibly anybody in my life will always be with me Words can t capture how I feel about him At this time I want to think about a wonderful life that he had and remarkable contributions that he made Personally I will always think of the wonderful time of my life that I was able to share with him By Ramesh April 18 2 1 General

has not already been said about CK It is almost ten years since the days of Praja and yet to this day and very often I ask myself what would CK recommend or say in any given scenario Whilst this is especially useful when considering a business opportunity challenging customer or logical problem it is equally important when considering most dilemmas or situations My time directly with CK and you Ramesh was relatively fleeting and yet has given me a certain balance and direction that is as strong today as those days in Zurich Harvard Paris Michigan and San Diego I am completely shell shocked by this I found out today from Scott Fingerhut and to be honest I am struggling to fathom this situation I will regret not attending a TiE event just a few weeks ago at which CK was a guest but I have to treasure my time with him and like you remember his wonderful and eventful life Very few people can touch so many people with such a strong effect I feel heartfelt thoughts for Gayatri Murali and Deepa I know myself the feelings of losing a loved family member my parents and I am praying for CK s family tonight One night in Detroit after a long set of meetings at GM CK took me out for a meal the taxi driver didn t know the way so CK directed him in the dark and rainy night to a restaurant CK had the waiters shift the table so as it wouldn t be too close to the kitchen door He ordered wine and corrected the waiter when he brought and poured wine explaining to the waiter the exact year of the vintage he had poured was a year later than that ordered the waiter was shocked to find CK exactly correct CK smiled all through this he simply knew what he knew both in business and in his social life I am left deeply honored by having known CK and having worked with him albeit for such a relatively short time Ramesh Thank you for posting such a beautiful tribute to CK and I hope and trust that you and your family are well Robert Anand Vaidyanathan April 19 2 1 at 9 21 am I still remember inviting CK and some of my other Praja colleagues to my place for dinner with families CK mentioned to me that he was returning back from a business trip that night and he would try to come to my place Much to my surprise he sent Gayathri with Ramesh Sudha and he arrived directly to my place from the airport I was very touched to see that a person of his stature made an effort to mingle with the praja common people He always had a way of being able to connect with everyone He used to invite Praja employees their families over to his place for gatherings as well as to attend some special occasions such as family weddings too It was a privilege to have known him and interacted with him It is definitely very shocking to hear that he is no longer with us May God rest his soul in Eternal Peace Anand Dinesh Jain April 19 2 1 at 9 1 pm I have known CK only thru you Ramesh and had met him 3 may be 4 times in life But his pleasant demeanor the brilliance of intellect left a lasting impression on me His theories were so unusual yet so to the point correct I think the world has lost one of the great Thinkers who had the ability to transform it positively I am sure his thoughts will continue to do so despite his phisical absence I also felt that Mother India produced such an able son who she gifted to the world and lost so soon May CK s immediate family and the extended family who he touched as the strength to bear such a great loss and more importantly keep him alive by making his words about India and world come true by practicing his managemnt theories and thoughts e commerce solutions April 21 2 1 at 1 8 pm Thanks for the post Sad to hear about the demise of Mr C K Prahalad Very rarely does one come across a person that make an everlasting impression and in that regard you were very lucky to have him I know his demise has left a void in your life something that can never be filled by anybody His contribution in your life is immense and that has in turn has helped you in many ways than one May god bless his soul Look forward to hearing from you soon again traducere engleza April 23 2 1 at 1 2 am I ve read the story and feel that he was a person of substance Sorry for your loss Gabriel Paromita April 24 2 1 at 12 13 am I am very glad to know that after so many years you really remember a person and taking about him so nicely You still miss his company that reflects from your post You know in our world there is few persons who actually remember someone else After reading your post I also starting respecting him Wish you luck for your rest life Direct Debit August 3 2 1 at 12 34 am Mr C K Prahalad is really a gifted person and his work justifies the truth itself His pleasant demeanor the brilliance of intellect attracts everybody and the simplicity is really heart wearing Glad to read the blog post and also moved Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked Name Email

Some people make a deep impression and change you in many ways.  In fact some people have amazing ability to make deep impression on many people.  C.K. Prahalad was one of those remarkable people.</p>\n<p>I was very lucky to enjoy very close friendship with him and his family for about 15 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 1985 to around 2001.  We met, maybe in 1983, when we both arrived at University of Michigan.  We were in different colleges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he in Business and I in Engineering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but met at a mutual friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Ila and Jagadish) house in a party.  During conversations, I was attracted to his keen and deep intellect and great sense of humor.  We met several times because we lived in very close neighborhood.  </p>\n<p>My friendship grew with him and was strengthened significantly in early 90s when I got involved in starting companies and approached him to be an advisor.  After a few year we started working on a project together that became a company called Praja.  I had moved to San Diego and Praja started in San Diego.  CK also decided to move with his family to San Diego to build Praja.  Much of 90s was the period when I learnt a lot from CK on many fronts.  In early 2001 due to the internet bust, Praja went through difficult period and was later sold to Tibco.  Then I moved to Atlanta and later to Irvine.  We met much less frequently after that.  </p>\n<p>CK was one of the boldest thinkers I met and worked with.  He was not afraid to think contrary to current wisdom, in fact most times he started from that position.  He was not afraid to express his thoughts to anybody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I mean anybody.  On the other hand, he was one of the most friendly and warm persons.  For several years, I felt that I had an elder brother to guide me and he and his family cared for us exactly like that.  He was very generous with his time and resources.  His taste for every thing was absolutely the top-most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether in intellectual things, wine, food, or any other material things or art.  He did not settle for anything that he did not consider the top quality.  </p>\n<p>Another very unique thing about CK, Gayatri, Murali, and Deepa was, and remains,  their sense of humor.  When with them, you are always laughing. Their ability to see the lighter side in things is remarkable.  </p>\n<p>Yesterday when I read in Newspaper about his passing away, I was in a daze for quite some time.  When I told Sudha, she started shouting and crying.  She was able to call Gayatri and talk to her.  About 30 hours after knowing that he has left this world, I am still in a shock.  The time spent with him and his family is going through my memories and I am reliving many of those moments vividly.</p>\n<p>CK was one of those people, who may not be with you, but his memories are so vivid that you feel that he is with you.  Moreover, what I learnt from him, and that is more than possibly anybody in my life, will always be with me.  Words can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t capture how I feel about him.  At this time I want to think about a wonderful life that he had and remarkable contributions that he made.  Personally, I will always think of the wonderful time of my life that I was able to share with him.</p>\n  \t\t\t</div>\r\n  \t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta-bar clearfix\">\t        \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\r\n    \t\t\t\t<span class=\"by-author\">By <a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/author/ramesh/\">Ramesh</a></span> |\r\n    \t\t\t\t<span class=\"date\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/c-k-prahalad/\" title=\"8:59 pm\">April 18, 2010</a></span> |\r\n    \t\t\t\t             \t\t<span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/category/general-updates/\" rel=\"category tag\">General Updates</a></span> |\r\n             \t \r\n    \t\t\t\t             \t\t<span class=\"comments\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/c-k-prahalad/#comments\" title=\"Comment on C.K.

It is almost ten years since the days of Praja and yet to this day, and very often, I ask myself &#8220;what would CK recommend, or say&#8221; in any given scenario. Whilst this is especially useful when considering a business opportunity, challenging customer or logical problem &#8211; it is equally important when considering most dilemmas or situations. My time directly with CK (and you Ramesh) was relatively fleeting and yet has given me a certain balance and direction that is as strong today as those days in Zurich, Harvard, Paris, Michigan and San Diego.</p>\n<p>I am completely shell shocked by this, I found out today from Scott Fingerhut and to be honest I am struggling to fathom this situation. I will regret not attending a TiE event just a few weeks ago at which CK was a guest, but I have to treasure my time with him and &#8211; like you &#8211; remember his  wonderful and eventful life.</p>\n<p>Very few people can touch so many people with such a strong effect. I feel heartfelt thoughts for Gayatri, Murali, and Deepa. I know myself the feelings of losing a loved family member (my parents)  and I am praying for CK&#8217;s family tonight.</p>\n<p>One night in Detroit after a long set of meetings  at GM, CK took me out for a meal, the taxi driver didn&#8217;t know the way, so CK directed him in the dark and rainy night to a restaurant. CK had the waiters shift the table so as it wouldn&#8217;t be too close to the kitchen door. He ordered wine, and corrected the waiter when he brought and poured wine&#8230; explaining to the waiter the exact year of the vintage he  had poured was a year later than that ordered&#8230; the waiter was shocked to find CK exactly correct. CK smiled all through this, he simply knew what he knew, both in business, and in his social life.</p>\n<p>I am left deeply honored by having known CK and having worked with him-  albeit for such a relatively short time.</p>\n<p>Ramesh &#8211; Thank you for posting such a beautiful tribute to CK, and I hope and trust that you and your family are well.</p>\n<p>Robert.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-3579\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-3579\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dd8865d49fb5f5e0c9f14a60551e4f23?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Anand Vaidyanathan </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/c-k-prahalad/comment-page-1/#comment-3579\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2010-04-19T09:21:26+00:00\">April 19, 2010 at 9:21 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I still remember inviting CK and some of my other Praja colleagues to my place for dinner with families.  CK mentioned to me that he was returning back from a business trip that night and he would try to come to my place. Much to my surprise he sent Gayathri with Ramesh &amp; Sudha and he arrived directly to my place from the airport. I was very touched to see that a person of his stature made an effort to mingle with the praja (common people). He always had a way of being able to connect with everyone. He used to invite Praja employees &amp; their families over to his place for gatherings as well as to attend some special occasions such as family weddings too. It was a privilege to have known him and interacted with him.</p>\n<p>It is definitely very shocking to hear that he is no longer with us. May God rest his soul in Eternal Peace.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Anand</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-3582\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-3582\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b33b048ec4e0c147feff4c0573081d7d?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Dinesh Jain </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/c-k-prahalad/comment-page-1/#comment-3582\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2010-04-19T21:01:11+00:00\">April 19, 2010 at 9:01 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I have known CK only thru you, Ramesh and had met him 3 may be 4 times in life. But his pleasant demeanor, the brilliance of intellect left a lasting impression on me. His theories were so unusual, yet so to the point, correct. </p>\n<p>I think the world has lost one of the great Thinkers, who had the ability to transform it positively. I am sure his thoughts will continue to do so despite his phisical absence. </p>\n<p>I also felt that Mother India produced such an able son, who she gifted to the world and lost so soon. May CK&#8217;s immediate family and the extended family (who he touched) as the strength to bear such a great loss and more importantly keep him alive by making his words about India and world come true, by practicing his managemnt theories and thoughts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-3585\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-3585\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c869d009df51e8a043834c627d2d20c6?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.quality-web-programming.com/ecommerce-solutions.php' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>e-commerce solutions</a> </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/c-k-prahalad/comment-page-1/#comment-3585\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2010-04-21T22:08:49+00:00\">April 21, 2010 at 10:08 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Thanks for the post.
