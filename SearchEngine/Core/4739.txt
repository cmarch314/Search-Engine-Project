{"text": "Combinatorial Game Theory Combinatorial Game Theory studies strategies and mathematics of two player games of perfect knowledge such as chess or go but often either concentrating instead on simpler games such as nim or solving endgames and other special cases An important distinction between this subject and classical game theory a branch of economics is that game players are assumed to move in sequence rather than simultanously so there is no point in randomization or other information hiding strategies The bible of combinatorial game theory is Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays by E R Berlekamp J H Conway and R K Guy the mathematical foundations of the field are provided by Conway s earlier book On Numbers and Games Many papers from the more recent collections Games of
