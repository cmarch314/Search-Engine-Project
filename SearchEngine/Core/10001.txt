talk to an academic counselor?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Your relationship with the Bren School academic counseling staff typically begins even before you start your first quarter of classes. <br/><br/>The counselors will help you clarify your academic goals (including whether you want to add a major, minor, concentration or specialization), map out a plan that leads to completion of all general education and degree requirements by your intended graduation date, and plan your quarterly schedules.\n<br/> <br/>Add a major, minor, concentration or specialization), map out a plan that leads to completion of all general education and degree requirements by your intended graduation date, and plan your quarterly schedules.<br/><br/>As a continuing student, plan to check in at least quarterly, or more often if necessary, with the counseling staff to discuss your academic goals, progress, and challenges. The counselors will inform you about other relevant campus resources, programs, services and opportunities that will complement your personal, social, career or academic goals. </p>\n<p>Both the professional counselors and peer academic advisors have offices in the Student Affairs Office (SAO), located in the ICS building, Suite 352. </p>\n<p>The professional counselors are available by appointment only.

An academic counselor will attach a summary of previous course work and/or contract conditions for the Associate Dean&#8217;s consideration. </p>\n<p>Only UC-transferable courses (<a href=\"http://www.assist.org\">www.assist.org</a>) will be considered when determining a student&#8217;s eligibility for readmission to one of the Bren School majors.</p>\n<p>The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will consider the applicant&#8217;s number of completed units while at UCI, number of units remaining for completion of general education and degree requirements, grades for coursework taken at other institutions or through ACCESS UCI, and demonstrated readiness for the academic challenge of UCI coursework. </p>\n<p>A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for three or more consecutive quarters must adhere to the graduation requirements: <strong>(a)</strong> in effect for the quarter in which the student is readmitted; or <strong>(b)</strong> those subsequently established.</p>\n<p><strong>Readmission to the Bren School after voluntary withdrawal from UCI <i>while in good standing</i>:<br/><br/></strong>Readmission will be automatic if the student re-enrolls within one year and will otherwise be considered on a case by case basis. </p>\n<p>A readmission petition can be submitted at the same time as a withdrawal form is filed. </p>\n<p>If known, students should indicate their intended quarter of re-entry at the time of withdrawal.</p>\n<p><strong>Readmission to the Bren School after voluntary withdrawal from UCI <i>while student is on Academic Probation</i>:</strong><br/><br/>In certain situations, the Bren School may approve a student&#8217;s time-limited withdrawal if it becomes evident that doing so will prevent further damage to the student&#8217;s academic record. </p>\n<p>Conditions for readmission in this case would be discussed at the time of withdrawal; any academic contract conditions in place at the time of withdrawal would remain in effect upon the student&#8217;s return.</p>\n<p><strong>The UCI readmission application must be accompanied by:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> A written statement no longer than 2 pages that details the reason(s) for leaving, the reason(s) for returning (including new or renewed interest/focus on Bren School major), and ways that previous or existing obstacles to academic progress have been addressed and will be addressed in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> An official transcript showing completion of at least 1 full-time quarter or semester of transferable courses in Computer Science or mathematics with a GPA satisfying the conditions specified in the student&#8217;s academic contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Readmission to the Bren School <i>after academic disqualification</i>:</strong><br/><br/>The Associate Dean will consider the number of units remaining towards breadth and major degree requirements. </p>\n<p>In general, a student applying for readmission will need to demonstrate that he/she can finish remaining coursework within a timeframe that does not violate university policies regarding excessive units (see Catalogue, &#8220;UCI Policy on Excessive Units&#8221; for more information). </p>\n<p>A student readmitted after academic disqualification will be held to the conditions of a two quarter contract specifying a course plan, unit maximum per quarter, GPA expectations, and mandatory advising sessions. </p>\n<p>Failure to meet the contract conditions for any of two quarters may lead to automatic disqualification.</p>\n<p><strong>The UCI readmission application must be accompanied by:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> A written statement no longer than 2 pages that details the reason(s) for leaving, the reason(s) for returning (including new or renewed interest/focus on Bren School major), and ways that previous or existing obstacles to academic progress have been addressed and will be addressed in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> An official transcript showing completion of a minimum of one full-time academic year of courses taken through UCI Extension (ACCESS), a community college or another comparable institution. </p>\n<p>At least six of these courses must meet major requirements (includes math courses). </p>\n<p>The overall GPA for this year of work must be at least a 2.5. In some cases the requirement that a full year of coursework be completed elsewhere can be waived, if there is considerable evidence that the student is fully prepared to return to UCI full time.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> If the student intends to petition for a Change of Major into or out of the Bren School upon readmission, he/she must submit a completed Change of Major form.</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Students considering applying for readmission after academic disqualification are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic counselor well in advance of preparing their application.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"><div id=\"sidebar_title\">More Undergraduate &#187;</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../sao/index.php\">Academic advising</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../courses/index.php\">Academic year plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/index.php\">ICS majors</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/Double_Majors.php\">Double major</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/Second_BA.php\">2nd baccalaureate</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/Minors.php\">ICS minors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../QA_Petitions.php\">Petitions</a></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 70%; font-weight: bold;\">Policies</span>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Academic_Honesty.php\">Academic honesty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Academic_Standing.php\">Academic standing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Add_Drop_ChangeOption.php\">Add, drop, &amp; change options</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Course_Outside_UCI.php\">Coursework outside UCI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Grade_Options.php\">Grade policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Laptop_ComputerUse.php\">Laptop &amp; computer use</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/Withdrawal_Readmission.php\">Withdrawal/Readmission</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"../QA_Graduation.php\">Graduation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../resources/index.php\">ICS student life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../computing/account/new.php\">Computing support</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a> |\n   \n   <!-- <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/sitemap.php\">Site Map</a> | -->\n \n  <a href=\"mailto: i%63%73%77%65%62m%61s%74%65r@%69c%73%2e%75c%69%2eedu\">icswebmaster</a></div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 10001.0}
