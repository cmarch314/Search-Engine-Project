{"text": "Lecture Lab Schedule ICS 33 Intermediate Programming Course Expectations Lectures and Labs Learning to program is an intensive activity We will have class every day of the week MWF lectures and TuTh labs By staying on task 5 days per week learning and practicing what we learn we are more likely to master programming in Python One learns programming by practicing programming Work Before During and After Lecture I expect students to read the assigned lecture materials either before class as a way to preview the lecture or after class where the lecture previews the reading to get the most out of both cover the material twice I will lecture during class but I prefer discussing the material and answering questions asking you questions about the material and amplifying on those topics that need further discussion I expect most lectures to be interactive with students participating Class mottos Those who are ashamed of asking are ashamed of learning and The only stupid question is the one left unasked Try to work out solutions to the assigned problems to prove that you have understood the material you can often test verify explore your solutions on the computer Here understanding means be able to use the information operationally to write code that solves problems If you have difficultly with a problem it indicates that you should probably go back over the related reading or certainly ask a question about it on the MessageBoard Forums One of the few advantages of a big class like this is the potental for peer teaching Because these problems are not graded feel free to discuss them but don t give away the answers for those still working on them working on exercises like these builds your programming muscles Students will be required to solve similar problems on weekly take home quizzes on which collaboration is NOT allowed Don t cheat yourself in this aspect of the course Lecture Attendance and Decorum I expect students to attend class daily arriving on time and settling down when class starts The announcements made at the start of class are often very important I expect students to neither carry on private conversations nor use their computers to answer e mail surf the web day trade stocks or perform any other activities unrelated to this course Someone once said Distance education begins in the 8th row of the classroom once you are that far back it is easy to stop paying attention So I recommend that students sit in the rows that are at the front of the room I once had the following comment on my final teaching evaluation Write bigger I could never read what you wrote on the whiteboard from my seat in the back of the class I have many deficiencies as an instructor students should help themselves get what they need out of this class like by sitting near the front if necessary Ringing cell phones disrupt my lectures Unless you are responsible for someone s life your cell phone should be turned off Otherwise you should set it to operate in some silent mode as mine will be set if it rings silently and you decide you must answer the call please leave the class with a minimum of disruption to the rest of the students If your cell phone rings audibly in class you will be asked to leave class for that day Finally if you know that you must leave early please sit by a door so that you can exit quietly and without disturbing the class Overall please strive to be a considerate class member both to me and to your fellow students doing so is especially important in large classes Schedule Topics

Labs</h4>\r\nLearning to program is an intensive activity.\r\nWe will have class every day of the week: MWF lectures and TuTh labs.\r\nBy staying on task 5-days per week, learning and practicing what we learn,\r\n  we are more likely to master programming in Python.\r\nOne learns programming by practicing programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Work Before, During, and After Lecture</h4>\r\nI expect students to read the assigned lecture materials, either before\r\n  class (as a way to preview the lecture) or after class (where the lecture\r\n  previews the reading), to get the most out of both: cover the material twice.\r\nI will lecture during class, but I prefer discussing the material and\r\n  answering questions; asking you questions about the material, and amplifying\r\n  on those topics that need further discussion.\r\nI expect most \"lectures\" to be interactive, with students participating.\r\nClass mottos: \"Those who are ashamed of asking are ashamed of learning.\"\r\n  and \"The only stupid question is the one left unasked.\"\r\n<p>\r\nTry to work out solutions to the assigned problems, to prove that you have\r\n  understood the material; you can often test/verify/explore your solutions\r\n  on the computer.\r\nHere <b>understanding</b> means \"be able to use the information operationally\r\n  to write code that solves problems\".\r\nIf you have difficultly with a problem, it indicates that you should probably\r\n  go back over the related reading -or certainly ask a question about it\r\n  on the MessageBoard Forums.\r\nOne of the few advantages of a big class like this is the potental for\r\n  peer-teaching.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause these problems are not graded, feel free to discuss them, but don't\r\n  give away the answers for those still working on them: working on exercises\r\n  like these builds your programming muscles.\r\nStudents will be required to solve similar problems on weekly take-home\r\n quizzes, on which collaboration is NOT allowed.\r\nDon't cheat yourself in this aspect of the course.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Lecture Attendance and Decorum</h4>\r\nI expect students to attend class daily, arriving on time, and settling down\r\n  when class starts.\r\nThe announcements made at the start of class are often very important.\r\nI expect students to neither carry on private conversations, nor use\r\n  their computers to answer e-mail, surf the web, day trade stocks, or\r\n  perform any other activities unrelated to this course.\r\n<p>\r\nSomeone once said, \"Distance education begins in the 8th row of the classroom\":\r\n  once you are that far back, it is easy to stop paying attention.\r\nSo, I recommend that students sit in the rows that are at the front of the room.\r\nI once had the following comment on my final teaching evaluation,\r\n\"Write bigger: I could never read what you wrote on the whiteboard from my seat\r\n   in the back of the class.\"\r\nI have many deficiencies as an instructor; students should help themselves get\r\n what they need out of this class -like by sitting near the front if necessary.\r\n<p>\r\nRinging cell phones disrupt my lectures.\r\nUnless you are responsible for someone's life, your cell phone should be\r\n  turned off.\r\nOtherwise, you should set it to operate in some silent mode (as mine will be\r\n  set); if it rings silently and you decide you must answer the call, please\r\n  leave the class, with a minimum of disruption to the rest of the students.\r\nIf your cell phone rings audibly in class, you will be asked to leave class for\r\n  that day.\r\nFinally, if you know that you must leave early, please sit by a door, so that\r\n  you can exit quietly and without disturbing the class.\r\n<p>\r\nOverall, please strive to be a considerate class member, both to me and to\r\n  your fellow students; doing so is especially important in large classes.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Schedule, Topics, Readings, and
