Our research\r\nfocuses on investigating approximate message-passing algorithms inspired by\r\nPearl\ufffds belief propagation algorithm and by variable elimination. We study\r\nthe advantages of bounded inference provided by anytime schemes such as\r\nMini-Clustering (MC), and combine them with the virtues of iterative\r\nalgorithms such as Iterative Belief Propagation (IBP). Our resulting hybrid\r\nalgorithm Iterative Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP) is shown empirically to\r\nsurpass the performance of both MC and IBP on several classes of\r\nnetworks. IJGP can also be viewed as a Generalized Belief Propagation\r\nalgorithm, a framework which recently allowed connections with approximate\r\nalgorithms from statistical physics, showing that convergence points are in\r\nfact stationary points of the Bethe (or the more general Kikuchi) free\r\nenergy. Although there is still little understanding why or when IBP works\r\nwell, it exhibits tremendous performance on different classes of problems,\r\nmost notably coding and satisfiability problems.  We investigate the\r\niterative algorithms for Bayesian networks by making connections with well\r\nknown constraint processing algorithms, which help explain when IBP infers\r\ncorrectly extreme beliefs. This study gives an account of why iterating\r\nhelps, and identifies classes of easy and hard problems for IBP (and\r\nIJGP). Finally, we plan to investigate iterative message-passing algorithms\r\nin other graph-based frameworks such as influence diagrams and planning.\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r110.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a> <br> \r\n<!-- <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~csp/r110.ps\"><b>PS</b></a> -->\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 4760.0}
