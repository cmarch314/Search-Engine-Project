This will need to discuss: the effect\n           that specifying a version has on the basic HTTP\n           methods, especially PUT; and the relationship (if any)\n           between the URL parameter and any Content-Version or\n           Derived-From header that may be present\n\n        2) Specify extended HTTP methods for version control.\n           This will include methods like LOCK, UNLOCK, and USE\n           (or PUBLISH).\n\n        3) More stuff, which we'll probably think of once we get\n           started.  This could include a series of Informational\n           RFCs talking about Web-based document management\n           issues and practices.\n\nEverything we do will have to take into account the various\ndifferent methods of document generation (remember, the users are\nwriting books, not programs), as well as the different version\ncontrol systems that may be used.\n\n- David\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0028.html\">Dave Long: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0026.html\">Daniel W.
