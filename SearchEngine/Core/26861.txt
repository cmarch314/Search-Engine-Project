are available to discuss your chances of being admitted to the program and to help you to identify other options Back to top Special Programs and Learning Opportunities There are several ways to add depth scope and experiential learning to your academic program of study An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major minor or concentration to your academic plan and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals CONCENTRATIONS Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus followed by a technology related internship in the host country Application Each student s proposed program of study specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U S must be approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student Affairs It is expected that each student s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection as well as considerations related to internship opportunities housing and financial aid The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan as needed Requirements A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture language if applicable and necessary history literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program international law international labor policy global issues global institutions global conflict and negotiation and global economics A one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and possibly cultural history and literature courses taken at an international university A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience MINORS Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue a minor a coordinated set of courses which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field subject and or discipline Note Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the student s major requirements Some major minor combinations are not allowed Biomedical Computing 1 courses Informatics 8 courses Information and Computer Science 7 courses Statistics 7 courses OPPORTUNITIES

To ensure admission consideration for the fall or winter quarter, students should be sure to file their application by the UC deadline as indicated at www.admissions.uci.edu. Applications must be submitted to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools during the filing period.

Former UC Irvine students must meet with an academic counselor to discuss admission for the second baccalaureate. Former UCI students will be admitted via the campus&#8217; readmission policy and must submit a completed UCI Readmission Form to the ICS Student Affairs Office in order to be considered for admission. All interested individuals must adhere to the readmission deadlines that are set by the Registrar&#8217;s Office.

An academic counselor will \nhelp you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor, \nor concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other \ncampus programs and resources that support your interests and future \ngoals.\n\t\t\t  </p>\n<p><strong><span><strong>&#187;</strong></span> CONCENTRATIONS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<br/>\n<li><strong>Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context</strong><br/>\n \n<i><br/>\nAll Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan \nthat demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other \nrequirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.</i>\n<p>\nThe globalization of the marketplace for information technology services\n and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in \nmulticultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive \ninternational operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the \nconcentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the\n history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside\n the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international \nhost campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host \ncountry.\n</p>\n<strong>Application:</strong><br/>\nEach student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a \nguided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be \napproved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student\n Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a \nhigh degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic \ncounselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education \nregarding course selection, as well as considerations related to \ninternship opportunities, housing and financial aid.
