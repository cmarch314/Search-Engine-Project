This talk will deal with one\nsuch issue, namely the limited amount of power in a battery powered node\nin the network. Traditional routing algorithms may drain a crucial node\nin the network that might have several debilitating effects on the\nnetwork at large. Several system level researchers have started studying\nthis problem producing interesting results, both empirically and\ntheoretically.
