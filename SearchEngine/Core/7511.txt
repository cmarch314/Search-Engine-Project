about the world and a commitment to solving problems are the passions that drive faculty at the Bren School Their research in the information and computer sciences are applicable to many scholarly and scientific fields But our faculty don t do it alone Students work side by side with nationally renowned professors to advance knowledge and improve lives Below is a list of research areas tackled by our faculty Algorithms and Complexity Bren School faculty members have made significant contributions to many topics in this field including graph algorithms and graph drawing computing with systems of pairwise interactions between objects such as web page links protein interactions or social networks and computational geometry computing with planar or spatial data more Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior Examples include computer vision bioinformatics constraint based problem solving text understanding data mining and smart sensor networks more Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology Involves the use of techniques from applied mathematics informatics statistics and computer science to solve biological problems Current areas of research at the Bren School include medical information access and knowledge representation for health care guidelines more Computer Architecture and Design Develops methods and tools for ensuring the reliability and quality of complex large scale software systems These methods and tools support the development deployment maintenance and evolution of complex software systems more Computer Graphics and Visualization Focuses on the field of visual computing that deals with generating capturing representing rendering and interacting with synthetic and real world images and video We work on end to end solutions from capturing of images and geometry representing large geometric image and video data sets geometry and image processing interactive access and rendering of large visual data sets algorithms for building large area immersive displays for the presentation of visual content and interation techniques in both small personal displays and in large displays for collaborative environments more Computer Supported Cooperative Work Information technologies bring people together through social networking through collaborative systems through digital media and through communications Informatics has been a long term leader in the study of social engagement through information systems Topics include distance collaboration workflow and process based systems multi user gaming and cultural engagements more Computer Vision Computer vision at UCI focuses on understanding the information processing capabilities of biological visual systems and on developing computational systems for processing visual media Research spans both theoretical questions of perception and object representation as well as practical applications ranging from automated surveillance to biological image analysis more Databases and Data Mining Focuses on research related to architectures index structures algorithms models and performance evaluation of a variety of next generation databases and information systems and technologies for data mining more Embedded Systems Focuses on issues relating to embedded systems a special purpose system in which software and hardware computing elements are completely encapsulated by the device or environment it controls Unlike a general purpose computer such as a personal computer an embedded system performs pre defined tasks usually under very specific constraints e g low power and requirements e g reliability more Environmental Informatics Humanity is currently facing a range of significant environmental challenges such as global warming species extinction pollution and overpopulation Informatics tools and techniques can help facilitate responses to these challenges and assist with planning for future environmental issues more Human Computer Interaction HCI research at UCI stretches from the architecture of novel interactive systems to the social and cultural considerations of information technology adoption and use We employ laboratory ethnographic and prototyping techniques to understand how people adopt adapt and respond to information systems Recent research has investigated privacy issues in mobile systems tangible interfaces for group awareness interactive animation and visualization of location information more Medical Informatics This topic concerns the development and application of information systems to healthcare Information systems have a critical role to play in contemporary health and wellness programs This includes technology in hospital settings but also persuasive technologies for healthy living health care in the home and in the community and in the interactions between partners in the health care system more Multimedia Computing Multimedia computing started receiving attention more than a decade ago Naturally early systems dealt with very limited aspect of multimedia With progress in technology several computing addresses important issues in creation communication storage access and presentation of information and experiences In our department we are addressing research issues in fundamentals of multimedia systems and their advanced applications more Networks and Distributed Systems Researchers investigate various issues in the design and analysis of high speed networks for multimedia applications They are actively involved in research on computer networks and distributed systems with the goal of designing analyzing and implementing communication systems that allow high speed transport of multimedia information between end users more Programming Languages and Systems Systems software research at UCI has expanded to include topics such as program restructuring and transformation techniques for parallelization and distribution compiler assisted memory management component oriented languages and dynamic code optimization more Scientific and Numerical Computing Refers to the application of computers to scientific problems from astrophysics to zoology The mode of application can be system modelling data analysis and mining or visualization The focus can be on developing new computational techniques such as parallel algorithms or new data mining ideas or on the novel application of existing techniques to new scientific problems more Security Privacy and Cryptography Bren School research in this area includes anonymity and authentication in network security key agreement and digital signatures in cryptography and security issues in electronic commerce more Social Informatics UC Irvine is an acknowledged center for the study of social informatics which incorporates the social and cultural aspects of information technology development and use Social informatics employs techniques and theories from social sciences and cultural studies to understand the shaping and applications of digital media and their organizational political historical and economic contexts This topic links information system analysis with design more Software Engineering Software research at UCI is aimed at creating new software technology and solutions furthering the information revolution The central goal of this research is improvement in software development evolution deployment quality understandability and cost effectiveness more Statistics and Statistical Theory Researchers at UCI are concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting analyzing interpreting and presenting empirical data Statistical principles and methods are important for addressing questions in public policy medicine industry and virtually every branch of science more Ubiquitous Computing Ubiquitous computing builds upon and unites virtually all of thfe current research strengths in the Bren School Researchers are addressing issues such as context aware computing whereby mobile computing responds to one s current context more More faculty Research
