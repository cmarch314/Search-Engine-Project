For example, broad-band filters (e.g. CMY), being more light efficient\nthan narrow-band filters (e.g. RGB), are desired for low-illumination scenes\n(e.g. night/dark scenes). But, they result in more noise in lighted scenes and have lower color fidelity. However, since\ncurrent cameras come with fixed RGB or CMY CFAs, users have to accept\nsub-optimal image quality either for dark or bright scenes. </span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;\n  text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Times'>Similarly, faithful\ncapture of colourful scenes demand more than three primaries that trades off\nthe spatial resolution making it not suitable for architectural scenes with\ndetailed patterns and facades. However, since current cameras come with a fixed\nnumber of primaries, users cannot change the spatial and spectral resolution as\ndemanded by the scene conditions. Single shot HDR cameras suffer from a similar\ntrade-off, sacrificing the resolution to achieve a higher dynamic range.</span></p>\n\n<h2>Switchable Modes Using Shiftable CFAs</h2>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;\n  text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Times'>We tried to overcome such limitations by offering new\ndegrees of flexibility using novel optical designs and computational methods.\nWe observed that by using multiple layers of color filter arrays that can precisely\nmove on top of each other, one can switch between different color primaries\n(e.g. RGB/CMY/RGBCMY) or generally, different operational modes (e.g. LDR/HDR).\nThis allows the photographers to choose different trade-offs based on the\nnature of the scene and the purpose of the photography. We demonstrated this\nconcept using several preliminary prototypes that can encourage the use of such\nideas in consumer level cameras. </p>\n\n  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-align:justify'><span\n  style='font-family:Times'><b>Publications:</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n  <p class=Arial style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\n    margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span class=SpellE><u\n    style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-style:\n    normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Behzad Sajadi</span></span></u><span\n    style='font-size:11.0pt;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>, <span\n    class=SpellE>Aditi Majumder, Kazuhiro Hiwada, Atsuto Maki, Ramesh Raskar, <span\n    style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma;mso-bidi-font-weight:\n    bold'><a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bsajadi/files/Sajadi-ShiftableCFAs.pdf\">Switchable Primaries Using Shiftable Layers of Color Filter Arrays</a></span><span\n    style='font-size:11.0pt;font-style:normal'>, ACM Siggraph, 2011 (\n    <a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bsajadi/files/Sajadi-ShiftableCFAs.MP4\">Video</a>,\n    <a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bsajadi/files/Sig11-SwitchableCam.pptx\">Presentation</a>)</span><span\n    lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;font-style:normal;\n    mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</div>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\t<!--#include FILE=\"stat.html\" -->\n", "id": 3099.0}
