{"text": " Brain Engineering Laboratory Frequently Asked Questions Q What is brain engineering The Brain Engineering Laboratory has as its goal a fundamental understanding of the brain its mechanisms operation and behaviors There has been explosive growth of information about the brain from a broad range of fields including neuroanatomy physiology biochemistry and behavior and tools from mathematics computer science and engineering are brought to bear to make sense of the voluminous data Our laboratory contributes to these fields and uses these data in an integrative way to construct hypotheses of how the brain operates to enable us to think perceive feel and act Inevitably as a scientific field arrives at an understanding of its object of study we are able to use the information in a proactive way to construct synthetic models of the system to enhance its effectiveness and to fix it when it breaks For instance as biological systems have become increasingly understood it has become possible to diagnose diseases to develop drugs to treat them and to build devices that mimic and can even supplant their operation such as artificial hearts and limbs The fields of medicine and pharmacology have grown from these fundamental biological findings The future of brain science will be no less productive and no less dramatic in its effect on our understanding and its influence on our day to day lives Q How are Brain Engineering and Neural Networks related A The field of neural networks began as psychologists and artificial intelligence researchers had been constructing computer models of human behavior and noted a number of key facts i Tasks that were easiest for humans were hardest for computers e g perception language planning and tasks that were easiest for computers e g expert systems medical diagnosis game playing were hardest for humans ii Difficult tasks such as recognizing a complex image e g a face could be accomplished by people in less than half a second but brain cells neurons could only respond about every 1 milliseconds one hundredth of a second leaving time for only about 5 1 steps to accomplish recognition No one yet knows of a computer program that could carry out such a complex task in just 1 steps Therefore the fact that millions of neurons operate together in parallel with each other may somehow be a key iii Parallel computers were becoming possible to build and all computers were becoming much faster enabling larger and more complex systems to be built This led to the design of software systems that borrowed characteristics from brains to explore new ways of computing These systems variously termed massively parallel computing parallel distributed processing PDP connectionism brain style or brain like computation artificial neural networks or eventually just neural networks contained a few shared elements many simple processors like neurons which could only process simple numbers scalars extensive connectivity among processors parallel operation of all processors Powerful statistical methods were developed within this framework and the results have become used in a range of applications The question remained of the relationship between these new methods and the mechanisms actually being carried out in the human brain Were the artificial neural network systems capturing the essence of brain computation and only omitting characteristics that had biological roles but added no important computational power Our lab and others investigate detailed designs of real brain areas taking advantage of an explosion of new data and insights from the growing fields of neurobiology We have found that hitherto ignored details of the anatomical wiring diagrams and physiological operating

by the brain and the resulting models have many attractive abilities and unusually low computational costs compared to other methods including neural network methods Q How do you know that the brain areas you study are actually carrying out the computational operations that you think they are A Of course we don t know we and all scientists generate hypotheses from the extant data and continue to test the hypotheses against new data as it arises We study particular brain circuits bottom up hoping that a circuit s natural operation will suggest the computation that it is carrying out As we construct simplified models we try to be alert to biological features that if added in are consistent with or even enhance the hypothesized functions or are inconsistent We also attempt as much as possible to identify predictions arising from the models that can be tested via biological or behavioral means though it is rare that models are able to make specific enough predictions or that such predictions are testable with any current methods Nonetheless as new biological data occur we continue to check the model against the known constraints to either strengthen the model or modify it or if necessary discard a refuted model for a particular brain structure and begin again Q What experimental predictions of your models have you tested either behaviorally or biologically A In the

potentials U S Patent 6 223 74 54 claims See the Applications page on this site Q What does brain engineering tell us about everyday thought If each sub component of the brain has a particular engineering function then what does that imply for the real use of the brain which is thinking In other words as we come to understand more about the mechanisms of the brain will that help us understand how we think The answer is yes When we think about something like getting ready for work in the morning we are actually using a large number of distinct brain engines all in concert and it is their combined activity that is thought Each of the different brain areas modeled gives rise to a different constituent activity of thought and areas working together can produce computational algorithms that are different from either of the parts independently The overall goal of brain engineering is to understand the nature of thought in terms of its constituent brain processes

In other words, as we come to understand more about the mechanisms of the brain, will that help us understand how we think?  The answer is yes.\n<P>\nWhen we \"think\" about something, like getting ready for work in the morning, we are actually using a large number of distinct brain engines, all in concert, and it is their combined activity that is thought.  Each of the different brain areas modeled gives rise to a different constituent activity of thought, and areas working together can produce computational algorithms that are different from either of the parts independently.  The overall goal of brain engineering is to understand the nature of thought in terms of its constituent brain processes.  Significant strides have been taken, but this is a goal that may take many, many years to achieve.\n<P>\n</font>\n\n<P>\n</UL>\n<P>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<p>\n\n\n\n\n</font>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n      <p>\n\n\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"images/brainanim.gif\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\">\n\n<center>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"262\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" align=\"center\" height=\"17\"> <font color=\"#999999\" size=\"1\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica\">\n<a href=\"index.html\">Home</a> | \n<a href=\"brainareas.html\">Brain Areas</a> | \n<a href=\"publications.html\">Publications</a> | \n<a href=\"Research1Intro.html\">Research</a> |\n<a href=\"Applications.html\">Applications</a> |\nFAQ |\n<a href=\"contact.html\">Contact</a> \n</font> \n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<font color=\"#999999\" size=\"1\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica\"> <br>\n<br>\n&copy; 2006 TSG.RHG<br>\n<br>\n</font>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font color=\"#999999\" size=\"2\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica\">[GrangerLab]</font>\n<font size=\"1\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica\"></font> </div>\n</center>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" width=\"14\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 31208.0}
