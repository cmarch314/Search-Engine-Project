A folder icon denotes a node that has children while a document icon represents a node with no children. Each node is a complete hyperweb of anchors and links. A child hyperweb also has access to the anchors and links stored in its ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>The hostname of the website is the root node of the hierarchy. All hyperwebs share this node as their common ancestor (which is the only node which does not have a set of anchors and links associated with it). This arrangement enables a mapping between a hyperweb and a URL. For instance, a leaf node <b>web1.1</b> whose parent is <b>web1</b> whose parent is the root node has an associated URL of &lt;http://host.domain.com/web1/web1.1/&gt;. A user can use this URL to browse the web in a Web browser provided that the host's Web server is properly configured.</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"../images/hws/hws_hyperwebs.gif\" WIDTH=\"493\" HEIGHT=\"191\"></CENTER>\n\n<H3>Displaying the hyperweb hierarchy</H3>\n\n<p>To display the children of a node, double click on it.
