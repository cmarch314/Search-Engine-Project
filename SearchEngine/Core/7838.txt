There is no prerequisite. If you and a professor agree to work together, you can, for as long as you want to.\r\n             </p>\r\n             \r\n             <p>\r\n             By working directly with professors, you not only get a taste of what cutting-edge research is like, you also get a preview of what graduate school might be like. Many undergraduates work not only with the faculty member, but also closely with the Ph.D. and M.S. students that the faculty member may employ.\r\n             </p>\r\n             \r\n             <p>\r\n             You become part of a team. As a result, it is not uncommon for undergraduate researchers to be co-authors on scientific publications. Some, indeed, have led these efforts and are first authors.\r\n             </p>\r\n             \r\n             <p>\r\n             As an undergraduate researcher, you will sharpen your skills on complex problems that are still in the process of being defined, and understand what contributes to a research project\u2019s success. Participation in undergraduate research also positions you well to attend graduate or professional (MBA, Law, etc.) schools. Our alumni succeed at Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, and others.\r\n             </p>\r\n             \r\n             <p class=\"image-fig\">\r\n             <img src=\"/prospective/img/opportunities-research-img.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n             <cite>UCI\u2019s HIPerWall can display 25600x8000 pixels</cite>\r\n             </p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style \">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pubid=xa-4d7e35ad5fb0fe07\" class=\"addthis_button_compact\">Share</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"addthis_separator\">|</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_1\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_2\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_3\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_4\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">var addthis_config = { ui_language: 'en' };</script>\r\n\t\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=xa-4d7e35ad5fb0fe07\"></script>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div id=\"footer\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lang-selector\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Language: </strong>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/en/opportunities/research/\" class=\"active\">English</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/zh-tw/opportunities/research/\" class=\"\">Chinese (Traditional)</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/ko/opportunities/research/\" class=\"\">Korean</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/vi/opportunities/research/\" class=\"\">Vietnamese</a>\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"footer-left\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t    <p>University of California, Irvine - Irvine, CA 92697 : 949-824-5011</p>\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"links\">\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/comments.php\" target=\"_blank\">Comments & Questions</a> |\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/privacy.php\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy & Legal Notice</a> |\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\" target=\"_blank\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\r\n                    &copy; 2015 UC Regents\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"footer-right\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.crispbrandagency.com/\" class=\"crisp image-text\" target=\"_blank\">Site By Crisp</a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "id": 7838.0}
