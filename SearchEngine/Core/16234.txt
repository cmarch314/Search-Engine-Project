can send email to 6a questions ics uci edu which will automatically forward the mail to the TAs and myself It is generally preferable to use this email address instead of our personal addresses because you are likely to get an answer to your question faster if it is sent to the three of us If you ask a question by email which requires a lengthy response we are likely to ask you to come in to discuss the answer in person Announcements Class announcements will be made in lecture and in section Important announcements will also be posted on the class web page The web page will contain the most up to date course information Any corrections or additional explanations for the homework assignments will also be posted there so please check the web page occasionally to stay up to date

previous homework will be available after lecture The new homework which is distributed in a given week will cover material covered in lecture that week and will be due the following Tuesday This means that when you receive a new homework assignment we will not have covered all of the material in lecture necessary to do the assignment but will have covered everything by the end of Thursday s lecture A quiz covering the same material will be given in class the following Thursday two days after handing out the solutions You should hand your homework in to class by 11 AM on Tuesday Absolutely no homework assignments will be accepted after 11 AM You can pick up your graded homeworks and quizes from the distribution center which is located in the ICS Trailers The office hours for the distribution center are Monday and Wednesday 1 4 Tuesday and Thursday 1 1 5 12 4 Each homework assignment and quiz will be available by the second Tuesday after it was handed in Questions On Grading If you have a question on how any of your quizzes or homeworks were graded talk to the TAs grader or me during office hours or after section Collaboration You are allowed and even encouraged to discuss the solutions to the homework with your fellow classmates However you are required to sit down and write up your own solutions independently In addition you need to write down the names of any classmates with whom you have collaborated on a given assignment clearly indicating that they are your collaborators Copying the homework assignment of another student is considered cheating Keep in mind that the homework contributes little to your final grade in comparison to the quizzes Thus it is very much in your own best interest to have a thorough understanding of the homework assignments before the quiz Academic Honesty All work done on quizzes midterms and finals should be your own work Cheating on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously Any such incident will result in a letter describing the incident which is placed in your file on campus Depending on the severity of the incident the resulting grade can range from an F on the particular examination to an automatic F in the course Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or expulsion from the university School of Information and Computer Science University
