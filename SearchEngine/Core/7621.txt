at the University of California at Irvine and a member of the Department of Informatics of which he was chair from its founding in January of 2 3 through June 2 4 He received the Ph D degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 198 His research interests are centered on design and software architectures especially event based and peer to peer systems and the way they scale across organizational boundaries Professor Taylor is the Director of the Institute for Software Research which is dedicated to fostering innovative basic and applied research in software and information technologies through partnerships with industry and government He has served as chairman of ACM s Special Interest Group on Software Engineering SIGSOFT chairman of the steering committee for the International Conference on Software Engineering and was general chair of the 1999 International Joint Conference on Work Activities Coordination and Collaboration and the 2 4 International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering He was the General Chair for the 2 11 International Conference on Software Engineering held in Honolulu Hawaii May 2 11 Taylor was a 1985 recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator Award and in 1998 was recognized as an ACM Fellow In 2 5 he was awarded the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award In May 2 8 he received ICSE s

ongoing initiative whose goal is to determine the impact of software engineering research upon software engineering practice Institute for Software Research ISR Established in July 1999 the University of California s Institute for Software Research ISR is dedicated to fostering innovative basic and applied research in software and information technologies working with established companies startups government agencies and standards bodies to develop and transition the technologies to widespread and practical application educating the next generation of software researchers and practitioners in advanced software technologies supporting the public service mission of the University of California in developing the economic basis of the State of California The Institute s activities are focused on Direct support of research projects including funding personnel Research support services administrative services Conference and seminar services Technology transition The Institute extends beyond the boundaries of UC Irvine and includes faculty from a variety of institutions The Institute s web site details the faculty staff and students involved the current projects events and news Research My research is focused on design the issues techniques and agents involved in creating and evolving software artifacts and processes Specific emphases include software architecture means for designing organizing and describing distributed and decentralized applications architecture based software development environments tools to support the conceptual approach ranging from design time tools to implementation to run time dynamic adaptation The foundational work on architectures has centered on means for describing architectures in various styles and development of new architectural styles notably the C2 components and connectors style and with Roy Fielding the REST style for Internet applications such as the WWW Current work in this domain is directed at developing with Michael Gorlick and Justin Erenkrantz the CREST style for computational exchange on the Internet The environment and tools work has emphases on environment architectures see the ArchStudio site for details an extensible software architecture description language and supporting toolkit see the xADL web site for the details and the download and architecture driven dynamic adaptation of applications Virtually all of this work utilizes event based approaches A variety of publications in this area can be found at http www isr uci edu architecture publications html Sample Publications See full list Richard N
