This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to explore ideas and showcase early results in this emerging field.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoth formal modeling and free-form authoring offer important benefits for software architects and designers, as well as others. Unfortunately, contemporary tools often force users to choose one style of work over the other. During the exploratory phases of design, it is more common to use white boards than modeling tools. During the early stages of architectural analysis, it is more common to use office tools like PowerPoint and Excel. These tools offer ease of use, freedom from strict representation rules, and the ability to prepare attractive presentations for a variety of stakeholders. However, users miss out on the clarity, consistency, and completeness that can accrue from using modeling tools, as well as the powerful visualization, navigation, manipulation, and guidance that semantics-driven tools can provide.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt this workshop, people who build tools and people who use tools for software development will discuss the reasons for the current state of the practice, and will focus on tools users' needs and tool capabilities to address those needs. Papers and live demonstrations will present work on free-form authoring tools and formal modeling tools, as well as hybrid tools that aim to achieve the benefits of both.\n</p>\n\n<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n<!--\n<h3>Intended Audience</h3>\n\n<p>The workshop is intended for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Researchers with interest in enhancing search technology for developers.</li>\n<li>Tool builders that want to improve the search experience of developers.</li>\n<li>HCI Researchers with interest in better understanding of the search needs of developers</li>\n<li>Search-engine providers from the industry targetting the needs of developers and software industry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nEach participant is requested to submit a position paper in advance and each participant is requested to read all the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be devoted to discussion instead of presentations. Submissions will be made electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of information.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe upper limit for the number of participants is 25 and the participants will be selected on the basis of the submitted contribution.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe actively seek a format which emphasizes fruitful interactions and discussions. This involves brief (5 minute) presentations of position papers; break-up sessions in discussion groups, and plenary meetings to discuss results. We ask that participants present and summarize someone else\ufffds position paper, which has proven to be a very pleasant way to stimulate discussion.\n</p>\n-->\n\n<!--\n<p>Hello and thank you for your interest in this template! Before you jump to any conclusions about it, please me explain the idea behind it.</p>\n\n<img src=\"img/example.jpg\" width=\"512\" height=\"160\" alt=\"image example\" />\n<p>First of all, this design was made by request from a friend who holding html/css classes for beginners. He asked me to create a design that was \"so simple that even [his] grandmother would be able to use it\", that he could use as an example in his classes. I couldn't resist a challenge like that!</p>\n\n<a href=\"#\"><img src=\"img/example-small.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" alt=\"image link example\" /></a>\n<p>There were some specific requests for the design, to make sure that it would work with the way my friend teaches. The content had to be separated from the presentation, and every part of the design had to be made in way that would be easy to understand - and learn from. No advanced tricks, and minimal use of IDs or .classes in the stylesheet. A fixed position site menu and some neutral images was also asked for.</p>\n-->\n\n<p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<hr />\n\n<center><small>Webmasters: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~nlopezgi\">Nicolas Lopez</a>.
