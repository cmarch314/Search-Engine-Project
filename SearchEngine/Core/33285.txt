original message was sent to more than one person you are asked if you want to reply to all recipients Think carefully before you answer it may be that you do not want your reply to be sent to more than just the author of the message It is always a good idea to verify that the addresses in the To and Cc fields are correct before you send a message Pine Folders Incoming messages may quickly accumulate in your INBOX folder Imagine what it would be like to find one hundred messages there If you use email often this may happen sooner than you expect How should you organize the messages you wish to save Organizing Messages With Folders A Pine folder like a folder in your file cabinet is a storage place for messages As you use email you accumulate many messages and can organize them into different folders by topic correspondent date or any other category that is meaningful to you You can create your own folders and Pine automatically provides three The INBOX folder messages sent to you are listed in this folder When you first start Pine and go to the Folder Index screen you are looking at the list of messages in your INBOX folder Every incoming message remains in your INBOX until you delete it or save it in another folder The saved messages folder copies of messages you save are stored in this folder unless you save them to other folders you create yourself See Saving a Message The sent mail folder copies of messages you send are automatically stored in this folder This is convenient if you cannot remember whether you actually sent a message or if you want to send a message again Keeping Folders Clean Messages whether they are in your INBOX or your other Pine folders occupy storage space and your storage space is limited Check your email frequently to see if you have any new messages Do not keep too many messages in your INBOX folder A large INBOX reduces performance it takes longer to display large lists of messages when you start Pine and it requires more time to move between messages Delete your incoming messages right away if you do not want them or save them to other folders if you do Routinely delete obsolete messages from all of your Pine folders You will get a monthly message via Pine that asks if you want to delete entire sent mail folders and all the messages they contain from previous months To conserve space it is a good idea to do this If you choose to delete such sent mail type y Moving Between Folders When you start Pine and press I Index at the Main Menu you see a list of messages in your INBOX folder If you want to see the messages in another folder you need to go to that folder The following text shows you two ways to go to another folder from nearly anywhere in Pine To access your folders and the messages that are stored in them Type L Folder List You see a Folder List screen like the following in which your current folder is highlighted When you start Pine the current folder is your INBOX PINE 3 9 FOLDER LIST

messages The folder disappears There is no way to undelete a deleted folder Saving a Message When you save a message you are given a choice you can store it in the saved messages folder or you can specify another folder Once you save a message the copy in the INBOX folder is automatically marked for deletion so that you will only have one copy When you quit Pine you are asked to confirm whether or not you want to expunge the copy from the INBOX folder To conserve space it is a good idea to do this Saving a Message to the Saved Messages Folder To save a message to the saved messages folder At the Index screen use the arrow keys to Folder INBOX opened with 2 messages the message you want to save or at the Message Text screen as you view a message Type S Save You are asked if you want to

following Message copied to folder saved messages and marked deleted Saving a Message to a Folder You Specify You will find it useful to create additional folders for storing messages on particular subjects To save a message to a folder you specify At the Folder Index screen use the arrow keys to highlight the message you want to save or at the Message Text screen as you view a message Type S Save to save a message You are asked if you want to save it to the saved messages folder or another folder SAVE to folder saved messages Type a foldername and press Return For example to save a message to a folder named papers type papers and press Return If this is the first time you have named this folder you see the message Folder papers doesn t exist Create Type y or press Return to create the folder Once you have created the folder or whenever you type the name of a folder that already exists you see a message like this one Message copied to folder papers and marked deleted Forwarding a Message To forward to a message that you have selected at the Folder Index screen or that you are viewing Type F Forward A copy of the message opens and the To field is highlighted Enter the address of your recipient and send the message as usual Note that you can modify the original message if you wish for example to forward only a portion of it or to add a message or notes of your own Deleting a Message You keep your Pine folders clean by routinely deleting messages There are two steps to deleting a message marking it for deletion then expunging it To mark for deletion a message you do not want Select and open the folder that contains the message you wish to mark for deletion If you are a Pine beginner this is probably your INBOX folder See Moving Between Folders if the message you want to mark for deletion is in a folder other than your INBOX At the Folder Index screen select the message you want to mark for deletion or simply view the message Type D Delete If you are looking at the Folder Index screen when you mark a message for deletion a D appears in the left hand column of the message line If you are looking at the Message Text screen when you mark a message for deletion a DEL appears in the upper right corner of your screen The next message if there is one appears Repeat this process to mark additional messages for deletion Undeleting a Message If you change your mind about a message you have marked for deletion use the U Undelete command to remove the deletion mark any time before you expunge a message After you expunge a message Pine cannot get it back Expunging a Message A message that is marked for deletion remains in Pine until you expunge it You can expunge a message that is marked for deletion at any time or you can wait until you quit Pine Once you have a few messages marked for deletion you may want to expunge them before you continue to work because it is easier to look through a folder index that contains fewer messages To expunge a message At the Folder Index screen type X Expunge You are asked Expunge message s from folder Type y yes or press Return Messages marked for deletion disappear Note that you will be asked whether you want to expunge messages that are marked for deletion when you leave a folder other than the INBOX that contains messages marked for deletion or when you quit your Pine session Using the Address Book As you use email you build a list of email correspondents Some of their addresses may be difficult to type or remember You can use the Pine Address Book to store email addresses for individuals or groups to create easily remembered nicknames for these addresses and to quickly retrieve an email address when you are composing a message Here is a sample page from an Address Book

additional Pine features Guidelines for Using Email Electronic mail is a unique medium of communication Messages can be replied to or forwarded with speed and ease and email has the potential to reach a wide audience These features can also be misused There are a few basic guidelines for the responsible use of email that can help you avoid common mistakes while you enjoy the full benefits of this technology The privacy of an email message cannot be guaranteed An email message may be forwarded printed or permanently stored by any recipient Email can be misdirected even when you are careful Do not put something in an email message that you would not want read by everybody And if you receive a message intended for someone else let the sender know Email does not show the subtleties of voice or body language Avoid attempts at irony or sarcasm The most effective email is short clear and relevant If you receive a message that makes you upset do not respond immediately and in any case avoid flaming that is sending an angry or rude message Email Tips As you use email keep the following tips in mind Email is easily forwarded to someone else Although this is convenient it is not always appropriate If you are unsure ask the sender before you forward a message Email replies may go to more people than you realize When replying to a message be sure to look at the list of recipients Email can be junk mail so avoid unnecessary proliferation of messages Email takes up computer space so delete messages you no longer need The integrity of an email message cannot be guaranteed If a received message seems out of character for the sender double check before taking it seriously Email is meant for informal correspondence as well as scholarly scientific and clinical communications You should not use email for official record purposes where a memo would be required e g personnel actions organization changes contracts and policy statements Email should not be considered private Confidential information should not be sent by email Quitting Pine and Logging Out To quit Pine At almost any place in Pine type Q Quit You are asked Really quit pine Type y yes or press Return to

How should you organize the \nmessages you wish to save?\n<P>\n\n<B>Organizing Messages With Folders</B>\n<P>\n\nA Pine folder, like a folder in your file cabinet, is a storage place for\nmessages.  As you use email, you accumulate many messages and can organize\nthem into different folders by topic, correspondent, date, or any other\ncategory that is meaningful to you. You can create your own folders, and\nPine automatically provides three: \n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n   <B>The INBOX folder</B>--messages sent to you are listed in this folder. When \n    you first start Pine and go to the Folder Index screen, you are\n    looking at the\n    list of messages in your INBOX folder. Every incoming message remains in \n    your INBOX until you delete it or save it in another folder.\n<P>\n<LI>\n   <B>The saved-messages folder</B>--copies of messages you save are stored in \n    this folder unless you save them to other folders you create yourself. See \n    \"Saving a Message\". \n<P>\n<LI>\n   <B>The sent-mail folder</B>--copies of messages you send are automatically \n    stored in this folder. This is convenient if you cannot remember whether \n    you actually sent a message or if you want to send a message again. \n</UL>\n<B>Keeping Folders Clean</B>\n<P>\n\nMessages--whether they are in your INBOX or your other Pine folders--occupy\nstorage space, and your storage space is limited. \n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n    Check your email frequently to see if you have any new messages. \n<P>\n\n    Do not keep too many messages in your INBOX folder. A large INBOX \n    reduces performance: it takes longer to display large lists of messages \n    when you start Pine, and it requires more time to move between messages.\n<P>\n\n    Delete your incoming messages right away if you do not want them, or save \n    them to other folders if you do.\n<P>\n<LI> \n    Routinely delete obsolete messages from all of your Pine folders.\n<P>\n<LI>\n    You will get a monthly message via Pine that asks if you want to delete \n    entire sent-mail folders (and all the messages they contain) from previous \n    months.

Messages can be\nreplied to or forwarded with speed and ease, and email has the potential\nto reach a wide audience. These features can also be misused. There are a\nfew basic guidelines for the responsible use of email that can help you\navoid common mistakes while you enjoy the full benefits of this\ntechnology. \n<P>\n\nThe privacy of an email message cannot be guaranteed. An email message may \nbe forwarded, printed, or permanently stored by any recipient. Email can be \nmisdirected, even when you are careful. Do not put something in an email \nmessage that you would not want read by everybody. And if you receive a \nmessage intended for someone else, let the sender know. \n<P>\n\nEmail does not show the subtleties of voice or body language. Avoid\nattempts at irony or sarcasm. The most effective email is short, clear,\nand relevant. If you receive a message that makes you upset, do not\nrespond immediately, and in any case, avoid \"flaming,\" that is, sending an\nangry or rude message. \n<P>\n\n<B>Email Tips</B>\n<P>\n\nAs you use email, keep the following tips in mind:\n<UL>\n<LI>\n    Email is easily forwarded to someone else. Although this is convenient, it \n    is not always appropriate. If you are unsure, ask the sender before you \n    forward a message. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email replies may go to more people than you realize. When replying to a \n    message, be sure to look at the list of recipients. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email can be junk mail, so avoid unnecessary proliferation of messages. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email takes up computer space, so delete messages you no longer need. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    The integrity of an email message cannot be guaranteed. If a received \n    message seems out of character for the sender, double-check before taking \n    it seriously. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email is meant for informal correspondence as well as scholarly,\n    scientific,\n    and clinical communications. You should not use email for official record \n    purposes where a memo would be required (e.g., personnel actions, \n    organization changes, contracts, and policy statements).\n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email should not be considered private. Confidential information should \n    not be sent by email.\n</UL>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"quitting\">Quitting Pine and Logging Out</A></H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\n<I>To quit Pine:</I>\n<OL>\n<LI>\n    At almost any place in Pine, type <B>Q</B> (Quit). \n<P>\n\n    You are asked:\n<P>\n\n    <TT>Really quit pine?</TT>\n<P>\n<LI>\n    Type <B>y</B> (yes) or press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B> to quit. \n<P>\n</OL>\nIt is a good idea to log off your computer whenever you are through with it or \nwhen you must leave it unattended.\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n \n", "id": 33285.0}
