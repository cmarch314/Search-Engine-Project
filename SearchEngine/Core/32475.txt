broke out in Germany my father who was already married to my mother was declared a Polish citizen since his father was born in Poland my father was born in Harbourg near Hamburg Germany but raised in Berlin My father his brother Benny and father Moshe were deported to Poland The story as I remember it from being told is that when it was declared forbidden for Jews to own businesses the brothers concocted a scheme Benny went to some government official and said he had to go back to Berlin to close his father s business and was given a two day pass Once in Berlin he went to the embassy of one of the Scandanavia governments Benny was a soccor player in Berlin and somewhat known He told the embassy official that his team was playing in whatever country that was and he needed to join his team for a match He was given a short term visa and left Two days later my father went to the Polish government official and said my brother never returned there must have been a problem now I have to go to Berlin to close my father s business and HE was given a pass Once back in Berlin my father went right to the embassy and said his brother was in that Scandanavian country waiting for him I would have to ask the details of what country if my mom knows it and could he get a visa to get there He was given a visa and the brothers met up at a designated place Then they fled from one Scandanavian country to another just steps ahead of the Nazis who were on their trail They managed to get to Switzerland where the government basically said they would not help them out but would not send them back and both Sydney and Benny spent the war in Zurich working for the Red Cross under trying conditions doing things like building roads and railroads My mother was stuck in Berlin with her mother My mother s younger sister and older brother had somehow gotten out to England and were there during the war with my Uncle being in the RAF But since my mother was already married to my father she did not could not leave Her father my grandfather Chaim Goldberg had also been declared a Polish citizen and sent back to Poland so it was just my mom and her mother alone together They were wending their way across borders and were caught in Belgium where they were put into a work camp It was the barracks where the Nazi officers lived and my mother was a maid while my grandmother was a cook Because he was working with the Red Cross my father was able to keep track of my mother s whereabouts and even be in touch My mom has the postcards which he sent to her with the secrect codes between them and some censorship from the Nazis where words were crossed out After the war was over my father was able to visit my mom a couple of times in Belgium where she was living in a DP camp He was able to come to America because his sister Goldie and her husband were already living here Regina and her husband had emigrated to Palestine before the war which is where their daughter Malka was born Goldie and her husband Hymie moved to New York just before the war so she was able to sponsor my father after the war Benny was with my father in Switzerland and Esther who was about 15 at the time survived a concentration camp My father came to New York in about 1947 48 and 4 months later sent for my mother My grandmother my mother s mother Bronia Blima Goldberg nee Schmuckler emigrated to Canada which is where her son had moved from England After a few years there she moved to New York as did my Aunt my mother s sister Fanny Fay Goldberg Gabbe And I was born in New York in 1951 There you go ISLPR aol
