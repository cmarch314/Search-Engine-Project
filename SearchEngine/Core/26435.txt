subset of TIFF for facsimile This subset is designated Profile S All implementations of TIFF for facsimile SHALL support the minimal subset Black and white mode is the binary fax application most users are familiar with today This mode is appropriate for black and white text and line art Black and white mode is divided into two levels of capability This section describes the minimal interchange set of TIFF fields that must be supported by all implementations in order to assure that some form of image albeit black and white can be interchanged This minimum interchange set is a strict subset of the fields and values defined for the extended black and white mode TIFF F or Profile F in Section 4 which describes extensions to the minimal interchange set of fields that provide a richer set of black and white capabilities 3 1 Overview The minimal interchange portion of the black and white facsimile mode supports 1 dimensional Modified Huffman MH compression with the original Group 3 fax resolutions commonly called standard and fine To assure interchange this mode uses the minimal set of fields with a minimal set of values There are no recommended fields in this mode Further the TIFF file is required to be little endian which means that the byte order value in the TIFF header is II This mode defines a required ordering for the pages in a fax document and for the IFDs and image data of a page It also requires that a single strip contain the image data for each page see Section 3 5 The image data may contain RTC sequences as specified in Section 3 4 3 2 Required TIFF Fields Besides the fields listed in Section 2 2 1 the minimal black and white fax mode requires the following fields The fields listed in Section 2 2 1 and the fields and fax specific values specified in this sub section must be supported by all implementations 3 2 1 Baseline fields BitsPerSample 258 1 SHORT RequiredByTIFFBaseline Binary data only Default 1 field may be omitted if this is the value Compression 259 3 SHORT RequiredByTIFFBaseline 3 1 or 2 dimensional coding The value 3 is a TIFF extension value TIFF The T4Options field must be specified and its value specifies that the data is encoded using the Modified Huffman MH encoding of T 4 FillOrder 266 2 SHORT RequiredByTIFFBaseline 2 Least Significant Bit first NOTE Baseline TIFF readers are only required to support FillOrder 1 where the lowest numbered pixel is stored in the MSB of the byte However because many devices such as modems transmit the LSB first when converting the data to serial form it is common for black and white fax products to use the second FillOrder 2 where the lowest numbered pixel is stored in the LSB Therefore this value is specified in the minimal black and white mode ImageWidth 256 1728 SHORT or LONG RequiredByTIFFBaseline This mode only supports a page width of 1728 pixels This width corresponds to North American Letter and Legal and to ISO A4 size pages No

resolution of the image is expressed in pixels per resolution unit In pixels inch the allowed values are 98 1 196 and 2 98 and 1 may be treated as equivalent and 196 and 2 may be treated as equivalent

encoding Bit 1 must be Bit 2 1 indicates that EOLs are byte aligned EOLs not byte aligned Default is all bits are applies when EOLs are not byte aligned Note The T4Options field is required when the Compression field has a value of 3 Bit of this field specifies the encoding used MH only in this mode and Bit 2 indicates whether the EOL codes are byte aligned or not If they are byte aligned then fill bits have been added as necessary so that the End of Line EOL codes always end on byte boundaries See Section 3 4 for details 3 2 3 New Fields None 3 3 Recommended TIFF Fields None 3 4 End of Line EOL and Return to Control RTC The handling of End of Line EOL codes and Return to Control RTC sequences illustrate the differences between conventional fax which is bit and stream oriented and TIFF which is byte and file oriented Conventional fax Baseline TIFF and TIFF extensions for fax all handle EOLs and RTCs differently In conventional fax an MH compressed fax data stream for a page consists of the following sequence EOL compressed data first line EOL compressed data EOL compressed data last line RTC 6 consecutive EOL codes Baseline TIFF does not use EOL codes or Return to Control RTC sequences for MH compressed data However the TIFF extension field T4Options used in this specification for MH compression Compression 3 requires EOLs Furthermore Bit 2 in the T4Options field indicates whether or not the EOL codes are byte aligned If Bit 2 1 indicating the EOL codes are byte aligned then fill bits have been added as necessary before EOL codes so that an EOL code always ends on a byte boundary and the first bit of data following an EOL begins on a byte boundary Without fill bits an EOL code may end in the middle of a byte Byte alignment relieves application software of the burden of bit shifting every byte while parsing scan lines for line oriented image manipulation such as writing a TIFF file Not all TIFF readers historically used for fax are able to deal with non byte aligned data While TIFF extension requires EOL codes TIFF in fax applications has traditionally prohibited RTC sequences Implementations that want common processing and interfaces for fax data streams and Internet fax files would prefer that the TIFF data include RTC sequences To reconcile these differences RTCs are allowed in cases where EOL codes are not byte aligned and no fill bits have been added to the data This corresponds to situations where the fax data is simply inserted in a strip without being processed or interpreted RTCs should not occur in the data when EOLs have been byte aligned This is formally specified in the next sub section 3 4 1 RTC Exclusion Implementations which wish to maintain strict conformance with TIFF and compatibility with the historical use of TIFF for fax SHOULD NOT include the RTC sequence when writing TIFF files However implementations which need to support transparency of T 4 generated image data MAY include RTCs when writing TIFF files if the flag settings of the T4Options field are set for non byte aligned data i e Bit 2 is Implementors of TIFF readers should be aware that there are some existing TIFF implementations for fax that include the RTC sequence in MH image data Therefore minimal set readers MUST be able to process files which do not include RTCs and SHOULD be able to process files which do include RTCs 3 5 File Structure The TIFF header described in Section 2 1 1 contains two bytes which describe the byte order used within the file For the minimal black and white mode these bytes SHALL have the value II x4949 denoting that the bytes in the TIFF file are in LSByte first order little endian The first or th IFD immediately follows the header so that offset to the first IFD is 8 The headers values are shown in the following table Offset Description Value Byte Order x4949 II 2 Identifier 42 decimal 4 Offset of th IFD x 8 The minimal black and white mode SHALL order IFDs and image data within a file as follows 1 there SHALL be an IFD for each page in a multi page fax document 2 the IFDs SHALL occur in the same order in the file as the pages occur in the document 3 the IFD SHALL precede the image data to which it has offsets 4 the image data SHALL occur in the same order in the file as the pages occur in the document 5 the IFD the value data and the image data it has offsets to SHALL precede the next image IFD and 6 the image data for each page SHALL be contained within a single strip As a result of 6 the StripOffsets field will contain the pointer to the image data With two exceptions the field entries in the IFD contain the field values instead of offsets to field values located outside the IFD The two exceptions are the values for the XResolution and YResolution fields both of which are type RATIONAL and require 2 4 byte numbers These long field values SHALL be placed immediately after the IFD which contains the offsets to them and before the image data pointed to by that IFD The effect of these requirements is that the IFD for the first page SHALL come first in the file after the TIFF header followed by the long field values for XResolution and YResolution followed by the image data for the first page then the IFD for second page etc This is shown in the following figure Each IFD is required to have a PageNumber field which has value for the first page 1 for the second page and so on Header First IFD IFD page Offset Value Offset Long Values Strip Image Data page Offset Next IFD IFD page 1 Offset Value Offset Long Values Strip Image Data page 1 Offset Next IFD IFD page 2 Offset Using this file structure may reduce the memory requirements in implementations It is also provides some support for streaming in which a file can be processed as it is received and before the entire file is received 3 6 Minimal Black and white Mode Summary The table below summarizes the TIFF fields that comprise the minimal interchange set for black and white facsimile The Baseline and Extension fields and field values MUST be supported by all implementations For convenience in the table certain fields which have a value that is a sequence of flag bits are shown taking integer values that correspond to the flags that are set An implementation should test the setting of the relevant flag bits individually however to allow extensions to the sequence of flag bits to be appropriately ignored See for example T4Options below Baseline Fields Values BitsPerSample 1 Compression 3 1D Modified Huffman coding set T4Options or 4 FillOrder 2 least significant bit first

This mode\n            defines a required ordering for the pages in a fax document and for\n            the IFDs and image data of a page. It also requires that a single\n            strip contain the image data for each page; see Section 3.5.

End of Line (EOL) and Return to Control (RTC)</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The handling of End of Line (EOL) codes and Return to Control (RTC)\n   sequences illustrate the differences between conventional fax, which\n   is bit and stream oriented, and TIFF, which is byte and file\n   oriented. Conventional fax, Baseline TIFF and TIFF extensions for fax\n   all handle EOLs and RTCs differently.\n\n   In conventional fax, an MH-compressed fax data stream for a page\n   consists of the following sequence:\n\n      EOL, compressed data (first line), EOL, compressed data, ... ,\n      EOL, compressed data (last line), RTC (6 consecutive EOL codes)\n\n   Baseline TIFF does not use EOL codes or Return to Control (RTC)\n   sequences for MH-compressed data. However, the TIFF extension field\n   T4Options used in this specification for MH compression (Compression\n   = 3) requires EOLs.\n\n   Furthermore, Bit 2 in the T4Options field indicates whether or not\n   the EOL codes are byte aligned. If Bit 2 = 1, indicating the EOL\n   codes are byte aligned, then fill bits have been added as necessary\n   before EOL codes so that an EOL code always ends on a byte boundary,\n   and the first bit of data following an EOL begins on a byte boundary.\n   Without fill bits, an EOL code may end in the middle of a byte. Byte\n   alignment relieves application software of the burden of bit-shifting\n   every byte while parsing scan lines for line-oriented image\n   manipulation (such as writing a TIFF file). Not all TIFF readers\n   historically used for fax are able to deal with non-byte aligned\n   data.\n\n   While TIFF extension requires EOL codes, TIFF in fax applications has\n   traditionally prohibited RTC sequences. Implementations that want\n   common processing and interfaces for fax data streams and Internet\n   fax files would prefer that the TIFF data include RTC sequences.\n\n   To reconcile these differences, RTCs are allowed in cases where EOL\n   codes are not byte aligned and no fill bits have been added to the\n   data. This corresponds to situations where the fax data is simply\n   inserted in a strip without being processed or interpreted. RTCs\n   should not occur in the data when EOLs have been byte aligned. This\n   is formally specified in the next sub-section.\n</pre>\n      <a name=\"sub4sub1\"></a><h3>3.4.1. RTC Exclusion</h3>\n      \n      \n      <pre>\n   Implementations which wish to maintain strict conformance with TIFF\n   and compatibility with the historical use of TIFF for fax SHOULD NOT\n   include the RTC sequence when writing TIFF files. However,\n   implementations which need to support \"transparency\" of T.4-generated\n   image data MAY include RTCs when writing TIFF files if the flag\n   settings of the T4Options field are set for non-byte aligned data,\n   i.e. Bit 2 is 0. Implementors of TIFF readers should be aware that\n   there are some existing TIFF implementations for fax that include the\n   RTC sequence in MH image data. Therefore, minimal set readers MUST be\n   able to process files which do not include RTCs and SHOULD be able to\n   process files which do include RTCs.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5\"></a><h3>3.5. File Structure</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The TIFF header, described in Section 2.1.1, contains two bytes which\n   describe the byte order used within the file. For the minimal black-\n   and- white mode, these bytes SHALL have the value \"II\" (0x4949),\n   denoting that the bytes in the TIFF file are in LSByte-first order\n   (little- endian). The first or 0th IFD immediately follows the\n   header, so that offset to the first IFD is 8. The headers values are\n   shown in the following table:\n\n          +--------+-------------------+--------+-----------+\n          | Offset |   Description     |     Value          |\n          +--------+-------------------+--------+-----------+\n          |   0    |   Byte Order      |  0x4949 (II)       |\n          +--------+-------------------+--------+-----------+\n          |   2    |   Identifier      |  42 decimal        |\n          +--------+-------------------+--------+-----------+\n          |   4    | Offset of 0th IFD |  0x 0000 0008      |\n          +--------+-------------------+--------+-----------+\n\n   The minimal black-and-white mode SHALL order IFDs and image data\n   within a file as follows: 1) there SHALL be an IFD for each page in a\n   multi- page fax document; (2) the IFDs SHALL occur in the same order\n   in the file as the pages occur in the document; (3) the IFD SHALL\n   precede the image data to which it has offsets; (4) the image data\n   SHALL occur in the same order in the file as the pages occur in the\n   document; (5) the IFD, the value data and the image data it has\n   offsets to SHALL precede the next image IFD; and (6) the image data\n   for each page SHALL be contained within a single strip.\n\n   As a result of (6), the StripOffsets field will contain the pointer\n   to the image data. With two exceptions, the field entries in the IFD\n   contain the field values instead of offsets to field values located\n   outside the IFD. The two exceptions are the values for the\n   XResolution and YResolution fields, both of which are type RATIONAL\n   and require 2 4- byte numbers. These \"long\" field values SHALL be\n   placed immediately after  the IFD which contains the offsets to them,\n   and before the image data pointed to by that IFD.\n\n   The effect of these requirements is that the IFD for the first page\n   SHALL come first in the file after the TIFF header, followed by the\n   long field values for XResolution and YResolution, followed by the\n   image data for the first page, then the IFD for second page, etc.\n   This is shown in the following figure. Each IFD is required to have a\n   PageNumber field, which has value 0 for the first page, 1 for the\n   second page, and so on.\n\n                   +-----------------------+\n                   |         Header        |------------+\n                   +-----------------------+            | First IFD\n                   |      IFD (page 0)     | &lt;----------+ Offset\n               +---|                       |------------+\n               |   |                       |--+         |\n         Value |   +-----------------------+  |         |\n        Offset +--&gt;|      Long Values      |  |         |\n                   +-----------------------|  | Strip   |\n                   |  Image Data (page 0)  |&lt;-+ Offset  |\n                   +-----------------------+            | Next IFD\n                   |      IFD (page 1)     | &lt;----------+ Offset\n               +---|                       |------------+\n               |   |                       |--+         |\n         Value |   +-----------------------+  |         |\n        Offset +--&gt;|      Long Values      |  |         |\n                   +-----------------------|  | Strip   |\n                   |  Image Data (page 1)  |&lt;-+ Offset  |\n                   +-----------------------+            | Next IFD\n                   |      IFD (page 2)     | &lt;----------+ Offset\n                   +-----------------------+\n                   |          :            |\n\n   Using this file structure may reduce the memory requirements in\n   implementations.

Minimal Black-and-white Mode Summary</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The table below summarizes the TIFF fields that comprise the minimal\n   interchange set for black-and-white facsimile. The Baseline and\n   Extension fields and field values MUST be supported by all\n   implementations. For convenience in the table, certain fields which\n   have a value that is a sequence of flag bits are shown taking integer\n   values that correspond to the flags that are set. An implementation\n   should test the setting of the relevant flag bits individually,\n   however, to allow extensions to the sequence of flag bits to be\n   appropriately ignored. (See, for example, T4Options below.)\n\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | Baseline Fields           |  Values                        |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | BitsPerSample             | 1                              |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | Compression               | 3: 1D Modified Huffman coding  |\n      |                           |     set T4Options = 0 or 4     |\n      +------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | FillOrder                 | 2: least significant bit first |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | ImageWidth                | 1728                           |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | ImageLength               | n: total number of scanlines   |\n      |                           | in image                       |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | NewSubFileType            | 2: Bit 1 identifies single     |\n      |                           | page of a multi-page document  |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | PageNumber                | n,m: page number n followed by |\n      |                           | total page count m             |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | PhotometricInterpretation | 0: pixel value 1 means black   |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | ResolutionUnit            | 2: inch                        |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | RowsPerStrip              | number of scanlines per strip  |\n      |                           | = ImageLength, with one strip  |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | SamplesPerPixel           | 1                              |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | StripByteCounts           | number of bytes in TIFF strip  |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | StripOffsets              | offset from beginning of       |\n      |                           | file to single TIFF strip      |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | XResolution               | 204, 200 (pixels/inch)         |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | YResolution               | 98, 196, 100, 200 (pixels/inch)|\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | Extension Fields                                           |\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n      | T4Options                 | 0: MH coding, EOLs not byte    |\n      |                           |               aligned          |\n      |                           | 4: MH coding, EOLs byte aligned|\n      +---------------------------+--------------------------------+\n</pre>\n      <p></p>\n      <table width=\"100%\" class=\"hangingMenu\">\n         <tr>\n            <td style=\"text-align:right\"><a class=\"naviBlack\" target=\"_top\" href=\"http://www.zvon.org\">ZVON</a> &gt; <a class=\"naviBlack\" target=\"_top\" href=\"http://zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC_share/Output/index.html\">RFC Repository</a> &gt; <b>RFC 2301</b></td>\n         </tr>\n      </table>\n      <table class=\"bar\" width=\"750px\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n         <tr>\n            <td class=\"naviBlue\"><a class=\"naviWhite\" target=\"_top\" href=\"index.html\"> Frontpage </a> / <a class=\"naviWhite\" href=\"longContents.html\"> Contents </a></td>\n         </tr>\n      </table>\n      <table class=\"hangingMenu\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n         <tr>\n            <td><a class=\"naviBlack\" href=\"chapter2.html\">Prev</a> | <a class=\"naviBlack\" href=\"chapter4.html\">Next</a> | <a class=\"naviBlack\" target=\"_top\" href=\"http://zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC_share/Output/index.html\">RFC index</a> | <a class=\"naviBlack\" target=\"mainWindow\" href=\"http://zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC_share/PHP/titleSearch.php\">RFC search</a></td>\n            <td><a class=\"naviBlack\" target=\"mainWindow\" href=\"http://zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC_share/PHP/download.php?rfc=2301\">Download as zip/tar.gz</a></td>\n         </tr>\n      </table>\n   </body>\n</html>", "id": 26435.0}
