{"text": "UV Editing Exercise The process of texturing involves using an image to apply various surface attributes to a model such as color or shininess This may seem a bit strange since an image is

texturing involves using an image to apply various surface attributes to a model such as color or shininess. This may seem a bit strange, since an image is 2D while a model is 3D. To overcome this problem, we must provide an explicit mapping between the two dimensions. This mapping is called the UV map. A UV is a coordinate in the 2D image space that is associated with a vertex in 3D. Sometimes there is a one-to-one mapping between vertices and UVs, but it can also be the case that a vertex can have many UVs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nObserve the default UV map of a cube below. You can see the UV map of an object by selecting it and going to <strong>Window &rarr; UV Texture Editor</strong>. Notice that while a cube only has 8 vertices, this UV map has 14 UVs. The UV map does have some features in common with the 3D model. Faces are preserved and some &mdash; but not all &mdash; of the faces that touch in the model also touch in the UV map. You can use regular camera controls to pan and zoom in the UV Texture Editor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"thumb\" src=\"images/uv/cube1.png\" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe cube's UV map looks like it could be folded into the 3D model. This is a nice property, but will not always be the case. Below is another UV map of the same cube. This time none of the faces are connected, the faces overlap, and the size of a face is not proportional to its size in the 3D model. This shows you the flexiblity you have when creating a UV map.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"thumb\" src=\"images/uv/cube2.png\" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTweaking UVs without a texture is pointless, so let's add a simple procedural texture to the cube. Right click the cube in the camera view and go to <strong>Assign New Material &rarr; Lambert</strong>. This should bring up your Attribute Editor, which should expose several material properties. Under Common Material Attributes, select the <img style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" src=\"images/uv/map_button.png\"/> button to the right of \"Color\". This will bring up the Create Render Node window. Click the \"Checker\" button from the list of options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo view your newly textured cube, hit the <strong>6</strong> key. As a reminder, <strong>4</strong> views models in wireframe mode and <strong>5</strong> views them using an opaque shader. The checker texture may look a little fuzzy. You can improve its appearance by going to <strong>Renderer &rarr; High Quality Rendering</strong> in the view's menu bar. To turn off texturing in the camera view, uncheck <strong>Shading &rarr; Hardware Texturing</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"thumb\" src=\"images/uv/cube3.png\" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nReturning to the UV Texture Editor, you should see the checker texture in the background. There are three buttons at the top of the window that will let you tweak the appearance of this background image. The <img style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" src=\"images/uv/image_button.png\" /> button will toggle the image on and off. The <img style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" src=\"images/uv/dim_button.png\" /> button will toggle whether the image is darkened or not. The <img style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" src=\"images/uv/filter_button.png\" /> button will toggle whether the image is filtered or not.
