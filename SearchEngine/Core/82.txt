Social welcomes an interdisciplinary class of fellows for 2 13 2 14 Bren School Ph D student Ellie Harmon is among 1 ISTC Social graduate research fellows Why do some backcountry hikers joke about how great it is to find a three bar forest a stretch of wilderness where their cell phones get a strong signal How do people decide who gets to run the Facebook page of their deceased friend How do the engineers behind online music recommendation systems guess that fans of The National might also like Arcade Fire These are just a few of the questions being explored by this year s class of fellows at the Intel Science and Technology Center ISTC for Social Computing one of a network of university based research centers supported by Intel Corporation Based at UC Irvine ISTC Social is focused particularly on interdisciplinary investigations of the social and cultural aspects of information technology and digital media Graduate fellows are expected to participate in all ISTC activities and not only at UCI Visits to Intel Labs in Portland and the center s partner campuses Georgia Tech NYU Cornell and Indiana University are also part of the program Informatics professor Paul Dourish of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences one of ISTC Social s co directors says this sort of collaborative thinking has been a great fit at UCI That s one of the reasons Intel came to us when thinking of developing an ISTC in the area of social computing Dourish says They were very attracted to the way we put informatics and anthropology together The question of what technology does is not simply a technical question You need to understand technology as a social and cultural phenomenon When it first launched ISTC Social awarded four yearlong fellowships at UCI for the 2 12 2 13 academic year This year all four of those graduate student researchers have received another fellowship and they have been joined by six more scholars As we ve ramped up and figured out how to work on different independent projects at the same time all of which feed into larger scale programs we were more comfortable with more fellows this year says Bill Maurer dean of the School of Social Sciences and the other co director of ISTC Social Five of the 2 13 2 14 ISTC Social Fellows are from the Bren School of ICS one is from the School of Social Ecology and four are from Social Sciences Nick Seaver a Ph D student from the Department of Anthropology is investigating how online music streaming companies like Pandora develop the algorithms that determine what kind of music to recommend to users based upon their existing choices My last project was on the history of the player piano and this one draws on that They re both examples of what happens when technology gets mushed up with music which is supposed to be an expressive thing not an automatic thing Seaver says People say there s no accounting for taste Well these big systems are trying to do exactly that and they have very complicated ideas about whether or not this is something you can compute Like Seaver Ellie Harmon from the Department of Informatics is in her second year as an ISTC Social fellow Last year she researched how suburban families use smartphone technology to stay connected this year she has just returned from traversing the Pacific Crest Trail the 2 663 mile track that stretches from the U S Mexico border to the U S Canada border where she examined how hikers experience smartphone connectivity or the lack of it There s this idea in popular media that getting rid of this technology lets you be better more present which I don t think is quite right Harmon says We re all kind of used to being able to get in touch with anyone at any time and when we can t it s stressful One of the things that s so interesting about smartphones is how personal they are for people she says I think it becomes an important part of who we are and how we experience ourselves and how we experience other people Harmon adds that coming from a computer science background she appreciates the opportunity to kick around ideas with the social scientists at the center That s one of the really nice things about the ISTC she says It s one thing to go over to another department and take a bunch of classes It s another to have a space where everyone s just coming together anyway Which is of course the whole point of ISTC Social I think we re on the cutting edge here says Bill Maurer We re really blazing a trail for multi investigator multidisciplinary work ISTC SOCIAL 2 13 14 FELLOWS PROJECTS

\n&#8212; a stretch of wilderness where their cell phones get a strong signal? How do people \ndecide who gets to run the Facebook page of their deceased friend? How do the engineers \nbehind online music-recommendation systems guess that fans of The National might also \nlike Arcade Fire?\n</p>\n<p>\nThese are just a few of the questions being explored by this year&#8217;s class of fellows at the <a href=\"http://socialcomputing.uci.edu/\">\nIntel Science and Technology Center (ISTC) for Social Computing</a>, one of a network of \nuniversity-based research centers supported by Intel Corporation. Based at UC Irvine, \nISTC-Social is focused particularly on interdisciplinary investigations of the social and \ncultural aspects of information technology and digital media.\n</p>\n<p>\nGraduate fellows are expected to participate in all ISTC activities and not only at UCI: \nVisits to Intel Labs in Portland and the center&#8217;s partner campuses (Georgia Tech, NYU, \nCornell and Indiana University) are also part of the program. \n</p>\n<p>\nInformatics professor Paul Dourish of the Donald Bren School of Information and \nComputer Sciences, one of ISTC-Social&#8217;s co-directors, says this sort of collaborative\nthinking has been a great fit at UCI.\n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons Intel came to us when thinking of developing an ISTC in the \narea of social computing,&#8221; Dourish says. &#8220;They were very attracted to the way we put \ninformatics and anthropology together. The question of what technology does is not\nsimply a technical question. You need to understand technology as a social and cultural\nphenomenon.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen it first launched, ISTC-Social awarded four yearlong fellowships at UCI for the \n2012-2013 academic year. This year, all four of those graduate student researchers have\nreceived another fellowship, and they have been joined by six more scholars.\n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;As we&#8217;ve ramped up and figured out how to work on different, independent projects \nat the same time &#8212; all of which feed into larger-scale programs &#8212; we were more \ncomfortable with more fellows this year,&#8221; says Bill Maurer, dean of the School of Social \nSciences and the other co-director of ISTC-Social.\n</p>\n<p>\nFive of the 2013-2014 ISTC-Social Fellows are from the Bren School of ICS, one is \nfrom the School of Social Ecology, and four are from Social Sciences. Nick Seaver, a \nPh.D. student from the Department of Anthropology, is investigating how online music-\nstreaming companies like Pandora develop the algorithms that determine what kind of \nmusic to recommend to users, based upon their existing choices.\n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;My last project was on the history of the player piano, and this one draws on that: \nThey&#8217;re both examples of what happens when technology gets mushed up with music \n&#8212; which is supposed to be an expressive thing, not an automatic thing,&#8221; Seaver says. \n&#8220;People say there&#8217;s no accounting for taste. Well, these big systems are trying to do \nexactly that, and they have very complicated ideas about whether or not this is something \nyou can compute.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nLike Seaver, Ellie Harmon from the Department of Informatics is in her second year as \nan ISTC-Social fellow. Last year, she researched how suburban families use smartphone \ntechnology to stay connected; this year she has just returned from traversing the Pacific \nCrest Trail, the 2,663-mile track that stretches from the U.S.-Mexico border to the U.S.-\nCanada border, where she examined how hikers experience smartphone connectivity (or \nthe lack of it).\n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;There&#8217;s this idea in popular media that getting rid of this technology lets you be better, \nmore present, which I don&#8217;t think is quite right,&#8221; Harmon says. &#8220;We&#8217;re all kind of used to \nbeing able to get in touch with anyone at any time, and when we can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s stressful.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;One of the things that&#8217;s so interesting about smartphones is how personal they are for \npeople,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I think it becomes an important part of who we are, and how we \nexperience ourselves, and how we experience other people.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nHarmon adds that, coming from a computer-science background, she appreciates the \nopportunity to kick around ideas with the social scientists at the center. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of \nthe really nice things about the ISTC,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to go over to another \ndepartment and take a bunch of classes. It&#8217;s another to have a space where everyone&#8217;s \njust coming together anyway.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nWhich is, of course, the whole point of ISTC-Social. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re on the cutting \nedge here,&#8221; says Bill Maurer. &#8220;We&#8217;re really blazing a trail for multi-investigator, \nmultidisciplinary work.&#8221;\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ISTC-SOCIAL 2013-14 FELLOWS &amp; PROJECTS:</b>\n</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p>\nJED BRUBAKER, ICS <br/>\n<b>&#8220;Digital Gravetending: Moderating and Mediating Online Identities for the Deceased&#8221; </b>\n<br/>\nDemonstrates how social media platforms and user practices are changing the conditions under which Americans experience death and mourning.\n</p>\n<p>\nMARK DUROCHER, Social Sciences <br/>\n<b>&#8220;Evaluating Data: The Emerging Economy of Social Media Marketing&#8221; </b>\nExplores the evolving landscape of the marketing industry and the specific services and technologies that social media agencies offer.\n</p>\n<p>\nJULIA HAINES, ICS <br/>\n<b>&#8220;The Seed Accelerator Model and the Development of Global Innovation\nEcosystems&#8221; </b>\n<br/>\nFocuses on three innovation hubs in different stages of growth &#8212; Silicon Valley, Singapore and Santiago, Chile &#8212; to investigate the effects of startup programs at the micro and macro levels.\n</p>\n<p>\nELLIE HARMON, ICS <br/>\n<b>&#8220;Experiencing (Dis)Connection: Mobile Technologies in the Wilderness&#8221; </b>\n<br/>\nA study of the experience of connectivity through a multi-sited ethnographic study of three situations: working professionals, suburban families and long-distance hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail.\n</p>\n<p>\nALEXANDER KNOEPFLMACHER.
