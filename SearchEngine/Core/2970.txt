In this report,\nwe evaluate several algorithms which make use of mid-level processing in order\nto improve boundary detection. Our first technique builds a probabilistic\nmodel of the relation between prototypical local shapes of edges and the\npresence or absence of a boundary. We also present a more explicit local model\nof curvilinear continuity using piecewise linear representations of contours\nand the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Lastly we consider a global\nrandom field on the whole CDT which captures continuity along with the\nfrequency of different of junction types. All three models are trained on\nhuman labeled groundtruth. We measure how each model, by incorporating\nmid-level structure, improves boundary detection. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first time that such cues have been shown quantitatively useful for a\nlarge set of natural images. Better boundary detection has immediate\napplication in the problem of object recognition.\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/RenFM_TR_2005/RenFM_TR_2005.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nXiaofeng Ren, Charless&nbsp;C.
