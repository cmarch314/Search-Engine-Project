complete FAQs for using X Score Any suggestion or comment on the program will be highly appreciated We have been benefited so much by communicating with the X Score users FAQs in Using X Score Q Why does the program prompt me cannot find enough pocket residues and then stop A This happens when the ligand is apart from the target protein Please remember X Score will NOT do docking for you Therefore before applying X Score please make sure that the ligand has been docked into the binding site of the target protein and more importantly they have been saved in the same coordinate system The simplest way for checking this is to re load the ligand and the protein on the screen to see if they indeed form the complex in the way you have desired Q How to choose among the three scoring functions available in X Score A There are three empirical scoring functions implemented in X Score namely HPScore HMScore and HSScore They only differ in the algorithm for calculating the hydrophobic effect term Statistically the accuracy of these scoring functions is comparable to each other at least for the protein ligand complex set we have used for developing X Score By default all the three scoring functions are enabled and the final result is the average of three predictions This practice is consistent with the consensus scoring strategy and is usually acceptable in most cases But it is also possible that for the particular target you are studying one particular scoring function performs better than the other two In such situation using that scoring function alone may lead to even more reasonable results You may want to perform a test run first to figure out which scoring function performs better for your target Q Why does X Score use chemical rules in pre screening A It is well known that drug like molecules usually have a specific range of physicochemical properties At present this feature is typically described by some knowledge based rules such as the famous Lipinski s rule of five Our own experience in applying X Score also suggests that by turning on the chemical rules for pre screening the false positives in the final results could be largely reduced We recommend you to apply these chemical rules in structure based virtual screening unless you have better ideas of how to select your compounds Q There are some water molecules in my protein PDB file Is X Score able to consider them A The answer is NO X Score will simply neglect all the water molecules Actually all of today s scoring functions do not have a good idea for handling the water molecules existing on the protein ligand binding interface This is something we are working very hard on and we expect the next version of X Score will be able to handle this Q My target molecule is a DNA Can I apply X Score A No X Score is an empirical scoring function which is developed for evaluating protein ligand interactions Its application should not be extended to DNA ligand complexes Q I noticed that X Score requires polar hydrogens on the protein and all hydrogens for the ligand because X Score utilizes a term for hydrogen bonding interactions Since hydrogen bonding is somewhat dependent on geometry does this mean that the geometry for any groups which may be involved in hydrogen bonding must be optimized In other words do I need to completely optimize the hydrogen positions while keeping the heavy atoms fixed A No The coordinates of all the hydrogen atoms on both protein and ligand are not used at all in computation Therefore the positions of all hydrogen atoms do not need optimization By the way if you want to add all the hydrogen atoms polar and non polar onto the protein it will not hurt Q Why X Score s result is always a small number while some other scoring functions give scores around several hundred A Because the scores are in different units X Score gives you the absolute dissociate constant of the protein ligand complex in negative logarithm pKd For example for mili molar mM affinity pKd 3 for micro molar uM affinity pKd 6 while for nano molar nM affinity pKd 9 So usually X Score s result is a positive number under 1 Q Why in the output file some of the ligands show score of zero A Because you have told the program to use chemical rules to pre screen all the ligand molecules If any of these molecules does not meet the rules you set in the input file it will be skipped in the later scoring process and therefore get a score of zero Content Introduction Download Installation Usage Trouble Shooting ", "_id":

Our own experience in applying X-Score also suggests that by turning \non the chemical rules for pre-screening, the false positives in the final results could be \nlargely reduced.

X-Score will simply neglect all the \nwater molecules. Actually all of today's scoring functions do not have a good \nidea for handling the water molecules existing on the protein-ligand binding \ninterface. This is something we are working very hard on and we expect the next \nversion of X-Score will be able to handle this.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Q. My target molecule is a DNA. Can I \napply X-Score?</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">A: No. X-Score is an empirical scoring function which is \ndeveloped for evaluating protein-ligand interactions. Its application should not \nbe extended to DNA-ligand complexes.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Q.

Why X-Score's result is always a \nsmall number while some other scoring functions give scores around several \nhundred?</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">A: Because the scores are in different units. X-Score gives \nyou the absolute dissociate constant of the protein-ligand complex in negative \nlogarithm (<i>pKd</i>). For example, for mili-molar (mM) affinity, pKd = 3.0; \nfor micro-molar (uM) affinity , pKd = 6.0; while for nano-molar (nM) affinity, \npKd = 9.0. So usually X-Score's result is a positive number under 10.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Q. Why in the output file some of the \nligands show score of zero?</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">A: Because you have told the program to use chemical rules to \npre-screen all the ligand molecules. If any of these molecules does not meet the \nrules you set in the input file, it will be skipped in the later scoring process \nand therefore get a score of zero. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"3\">\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"index.html\"><font size=\"3\">[Content]</font></a><font\nsize=\"3\"> </font><a href=\"intro.html\"><font size=\"3\">[Introduction]</font></a><font\nsize=\"3\"> </font><a href=\"download.html\"><font size=\"3\">[Download]</font></a><font\nsize=\"3\"> <a href=\"install.html\">[Installation]</a> </font><a href=\"usage.html\"><font size=\"3\">[Usage]</font></a><font\nsize=\"3\"> [Trouble Shooting]</font></p>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 36856.0}
