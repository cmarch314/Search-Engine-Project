We have implemented\n    a mixture-model based method described by Allison <i>et\n    al.</i> <a href=\"/help/#references\">[13]</a> for the\n    computation of the global false positive and negative levels\n    inherent in a DNA microarray experiment <a href=\"/help/#references\">[6,8]</a>.  \n    The basic idea is to consider\n    the <i>p-</i>values as a new data set and to build a probabilistic\n    model for these new data. When control data sets are compared to one\n    another (i.e. no differential gene expression) it is easy to see\n    that the <i>p-</i>values ought to have a uniform distribution\n    between zero and one. In contrast, when data sets from different\n    genotypes or treatment conditions are compared to one another, a\n    non-uniform distribution will be observed in which <i>p-</i>values\n    will tend to cluster more closely to zero than one.\n  </p>\n  <img src=\"/static/img/p-value.jpg\" />\n  <p>\n    <b>Distribution of the <i>p-</i>values from the <i>lrp+</i> vs.\n      <i>lrp-</i> data from Hung et al. </b>\n    <a href=\"/help/#references\">[7]</a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The <i>p-</i>values, based on a regularized t-test distribution, of\n    the 2,758 genes (<i>lrp+</i> vs. <i>lrp-</i>) expressed at value\n    above background in all replicate experiments grouped into 100 bins\n    and plotted against the number of genes in each bin. The dotted line\n    indicates the uniform distribution of <i>p-</i>values under\n    conditions of no differential expression. The fitted model (dashed\n    curve) is a mixture of a beta and the uniform distribution (dotted\n    line).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    That is, there will be a subset of differentially expressed genes\n    with &quot;significant&quot; <i>p-</i>values.  The computational\n    method of Allison <a href=\"/help/#references\">[13]</a>\n    is used to model this mixture of uniform and non-uniform\n    distributions to determine the probability, PPDE(p) ranging from 0\n    to 1, that any gene at any given <i>p-</i>value is differentially\n    expressed; that is, that it is a member of the uniform (not\n    differentially expressed) or the non-uniform (differentially\n    expressed) distribution. With this method, we can estimate the rates\n    of false positives and false negatives as well as true positives and\n    true negatives at any given <i>p-</i>value threshold,\n    PPDE(&lt;p). In other words, we can obtain a posterior probability\n    of differential expression PPDE(p) value for each gene measurement\n    and a PPDE(&lt;p) value at any given <i>p-</i>value threshold based\n    on the experiment-wide global false positive level and\n    the <i>p-</i>value exhibited by that gene\n    <a href=\"/help/#references\">[6,8]</a>. It should also\n    be emphasized that this information allows us to infer the\n    genome-wide number of genes that are differentially expressed; that\n    is, the fraction of genes in the non-uniform distribution\n    (differentially expressed) and the fraction of genes in the uniform\n    distribution (not differentially expressed).\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n", "id": 36240.0}
