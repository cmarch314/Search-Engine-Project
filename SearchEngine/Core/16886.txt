to UC Regents No reservations required Supporting Access to Collections of Digital Video Andreas Girgensohn FX Palo Alto Laboratory andreasg pal xerox com At FX Palo Alto Laboratory meetings and presentations are conducted in a conference room outfitted with several video cameras Digital videos of these events are collected in a video library that serves as a corporate memory In such a large collection of digitized videos it is often difficult to find both the appropriate video file and the portion of the video that is of interest We have developed a Web based video browser that graphically presents information about the contents of each video and includes a number of aids that facilitate browsing and navigating the video A media player is tightly integrated with the browser for playback from any point in the video We want to support the access to our video collection without manual preparation work such as manual transcription and or speaker identification Therefore we use a number of automatic techniques that provide indices into the video material and interfaces that allow users to browse video using those indices In this talk I will describe the techniques for automatically identifying interesting segments and demonstrate the user aids for navigating the videos and the automatically generated video summaries based on these techniques The system has been in constant use for almost two years and has been evaluated in a user study Biography Dr Andreas Girgensohn is a Senior Research Scientist at FX Palo Alto Laboratory Palo Alto California He has been developing tools to support developers and end users In the last four years this effort has been directed in the area of using the Web to design and develop collaborative applications At FX Palo Alto Laboratory he is working on Web based video indexing and corporate memory applications Prior to that he worked at NYNEX Science Technology now Bell Atlantic on task oriented user interface design and development on support for software developers and on tools for improving communication and collaboration using the World Wide Web and Lotus Notes Dr Girgensohn has delivered papers and tutorials on collaborative applications and innovative user interaction techniques at a number of conferences including CHI 97 and 98 CSCW 96 and 98 GROUP 97 Hypertext 96 Interact 95 and WWW6 He received his Ph D in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1992 and his Masters in Computer Science from the University of Stuttgart Germany in 1987 Enhancing Awareness and Coordination through Subscriptions Michael Kantor Information and Computer Science University of California Irvine mkantor ics uci edu Coordinating work between many groups is an important issue for many complex tasks While awareness tools are commonly used to enhance coordination within a group we will present an approach that creates awareness to enhance coordination between groups By using a push technology we create an awareness of information generated by different work groups This helps workers stay aware of issues and decisions made by other groups that could affect their work We will present the Knowledge Depot group memory and Subscription Service and compare it to other approaches for creating awareness between groups Biography Michael Kantor is a Ph D student in Information and Computer Science at the University of California Irvine He received his M S in Computer Science from the University of California Irvine in 1997 and his B S in Computer Engineering from the University of Washington Seattle in 1994 He has research interests in user interfaces and computer mediated communication He has built a number of web and Lotus notes based groupware systems for Bell Atlantic and studied their use and impact upon the user groups Meeting Coordinator David F Redmiles Information and Computer Science University of California Irvine redmiles ics uci edu Directions to the meeting
