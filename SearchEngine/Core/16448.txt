Yet in software development\nEarned\nValue frequently results in frustration as the benefits derived seem\nless\nthan the effort expended.  This unfortunate experience often deters\norganizations from further use of Earned Value, or results in less rigorous\nimplementations leading to even less benefit.  Much of the difficulty in\napplying Earned Value to software projects is due to the very nature of\nsoftware\ndevelopment.  Requirements creep, code growth, unclear completion\ncriteria,\nand system integration problems are examples of the challenges in\napplying\nEarned Value to software development. Additionally, system and software\ndevelopment has grown in complexity in the twenty-five years since\nEarned\nValue was first defined.  Still we try to use the original concepts,\nunchanged. This talk will address the traps that are often encountered\nin\nthe application of Earned Value.  Recommendations and novel concepts\nwill be\npresented to avoid these traps. Suggested refinements to the basic\nEarned\nValue concepts will be discussed to reduce the frustration and add to\nthe\nbenefit. Level-of-Effort (LOE) measurement, the meaningless method of\nrecording accomplishment, will be addressed.  Formulas to compensate\nEarned\nValue indicators for LOE will be shown to reduce the negative impact of\nthis\nmeasurement scheme.  Time will be allowed for significant discussions,\nquestions, and challenges to the concepts discussed.\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\n<p>\nMr. Stratton is founder and president of Management Technologies, a\nprogram\nmanagement training and consulting firm.  He has taught Technical\nPerformance Measurement, Earned Value, Program Management Metrics and\nSoftware Project Management to US and foreign governments, educational\ninstitutions, and a wide range of industries.  He is an instructor with\nthe\nUCI University Extension, and CSULB's Systems and Software Engineering\nForum\nfor Training (SSEFT). He is also a member and seminar instructor for \nthe Program Management Institute (PMI).\n \n<p>\n\nRay W. Stratton has over twenty years experience as a software program\nmanager in the development of radar, communication, and command and\ncontrol\nprojects.  Previously he designed, developed, tested, and delivered\nreal-time man-in-the-loop sensor based computer systems for a variety of\nmilitary customers.  He is a member of the Cal Poly Computer Science\nIndustry Advisory Council and has also participated in the Cal Poly\nCollege\nof Engineering Dean's Advisory Council.  He is also a member of the\nDefense\nSystems Management College Alumni Association (DSMCAA).\nHe holds Masters and Bachelors degrees in Electronic Engineering from\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, Pomona.\n \n\n<font size=+1>\n<STRONG><P>Coordinator: </STRONG> Cynthia Parish, \n<a href=\"http://www.uces.csulb.edu/\">CSULB</a>/<a\nhref=\"http://www.uces.csulb.edu/sseft/index.html\">SSEFT</a>,\n<A HREF=\"mailto:cparish@uces.csulb.edu\">cparish@uces.csulb.edu</A> </P>\n</font size>\n<p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html\">\nUCI Maps and Directions</a> to meeting are available.\n<p>\n\n<strong>Next Meeting: </strong>\n<blockquote>\nDate: Friday, October 29, 1999<BR>\nTopic: Key Aspects of Continuous Process Improvement - Experiences\n       and Lessons Learned\n\n<!---a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/flyers/99/oct99.html\"--><!---/a--><BR>\nSpeaker: Don Dortenzo, Software Productivity Consortium\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dortenzo@software.org\">dortenzo@software.org</a> \n<br>\nCoordinator: Leitha Purcell, Northrop Grumman,\n<A HREF=\"mailto:purcele@mail.northgrum.com\">purcele@mail.northgrum.com</a>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Irvine Research Unit in Software wishes to thank its\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsors.html\">corporate\nsponsors</a>:\n \n<p>\n \n<strong>Sustaining:</strong>\n<blockquote>\nThe Boeing Company * IBM * Microsoft Corporation * Northrop Grumman\nCorporation\n<br>Raytheon Company * Sun Microsystems * TRW</blockquote>\n \n<p>\n<strong>Supporting:</strong>\n<blockquote>\n    Beckman Coulter * FileNet Corporation * Printronix, Inc.<br>\n    Continuus Software Corporation * Hewlett-Packard\n</blockquote>\n \n<p>\n \nFor further information on\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin.html\">SPIN</a> or\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">IRUS,</a><br>\n<dd>contact <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/staff.html\">Debra\nBrodbeck</a>\nat (949) 824-2260,\n<a href=\"mailto:brodbeck@ics.uci.edu\">brodbeck@ics.uci.edu</a>\n</dd>\n\n<P><br>\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\nUniversity of California, Irvine  CA 92697-3425 <BR>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 16448.0}
