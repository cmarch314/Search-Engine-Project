intended as a quick guide to get you started using Nomatic IM When you first launch the program you will be presented with a screen similar to this On the far left is your presence description This is a short description of your current status In the image above since the application has just launched no presence has been set yet Set your presence by clicking the change button You will be presented with this dialog window Here you can see that Nomatic IM defines presence as the sum of three parts place activity and other These divisions are not strict they are more like guidelines for describing what you are currently doing Just enter some short text into any or all of the three fields it is OK to leave some blank After you have used Nomatic IM for a while the list boxes will begin to be populated with things you have entered before Instead of typing your status every time you may prefer to just click on an item in the list to have Nomatic IM enter that text for you You can also use tab keys arrow keys and the delete key to move through the dialog quickly Click the change button to set your presence Now the presence description has changed to reflect your selection At this point Nomatic IM will automatically set your status in any supported instant messenger clients you are currently running to your presence text On the Mac Nomatic IM supports Adium iChat Skype and pidgin On Window we support Skype and pidgin On Linux we support Skype and pidgin In addition to updating your IM clients Nomatic IM is sending information about your status to our research servers for analysis You can see the information we are collecting by clicking on the Dashboard button When the Dashboard is open Nomatic IM uses a lot more CPU than when it is closed so it s a good idea to close it if you aren t interested in what it is showing Even if you don t have any instant messenger clients running Nomatic IM will continue to report to our research servers while it is running Sometimes you may notice that Nomatic IM is Waiting to learn or Getting smarter The program displays these messages when it is doing computations to try and improve its guess about what you would want to set your presence text to Learning takes a lot of computing power so Nomatic IM doesn t do it unless you are connected to a power source and the computer is idle for at least a minute On occasion Nomatic IM will raise a window which is meant to interrupt you to keep your presence accurate When this happens you can either set your presence cancel the dialog box or ignore it The reason why the dialog box appeared is shown on the top of the window Clicking the Reaffirm button is the same as clicking change and setting your presence to the same thing you had before When you do this Nomatic IM will learn from the additional data and reset any internal timers it is maintaining You do not have to hit this button if you don t want to Clicking the Clear button will blank out your presence setting It is the same as clicking change and then entering blank in each of the fields This button is helpful if you decide that you want to report a blank status to your instant messenger clients When you click click the clear button and your presence will be removed Especially for User Study Participants For those people using the research study version of Nomatic IM SVN Revision 852 in the About Window you will find that when the dialog box is automatically raised in addition to a reason listed at the top of the window there is a slider at the bottom of the window The slider is asking you how appropriate the interruption by the dialog box was When you set you presence please also set the slider to the right setting The value that you choose is part of what we are evaluating in this study The change button will remain greyed out and not working until you move the slider Another thing that we are evaluating in the user study is how good the suggestions for presence are In this version of the software the suggestions are intentionally degraded So if you see very strange suggestions showing up that is part of the design of this study The next step in the user study is to download the research version of our software and install it on your computer The Mac version of the software comes in a standard compressed pkg format Download it from Mac Download Click on the file to unzip it then click on the pkg file to install the program It should be installed in your Applications directory You will need to manually start it by double clicking on it s icon After you download the software please add one or more of these buddies to your IM buddy list using your IM client not using Nomatic IM on AIM nomaticbot1 on GTalk nomaticbot1 Please run Nomatic IM whenever you are running your IM client Once we see that you have logged into the system we will contact you again for the last set up step Last modified 7 years ago Last modified on Feb 27 2 8 8 3 18 AM Download in other
