These concepts\nallow an application's hypermedia needs to be easily modeled and then implemented\nby making the appropriate calls on Chimera's application program interface\n(API). In fact, the primary task of integrating an application with Chimera\nis making the appropriate API calls to create persistent instances of these\nconcepts in a Chimera hyperweb. This section of the Chimera website is devoted\nto explaining Chimera's concepts and how they allow an application to take\nadvantage of Chimera's hypermedia services. A summary of the concepts appears\nbelow with links leading to a more detailed discussion of each concept.</P>\n\n<P><TABLE BORDER=\"1\" CELLSPACING=\"2\" CELLPADDING=\"4\">\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"viewers.html\">Viewers</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">Viewers are used to display and manipulate information. Example viewers\ninclude image applications, database programs, and word processors.</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"objects.html\">Objects</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">Object is a generic term for application-specific information. This information\ncan be persistent or transient. Objects can be practically anything including\nwidgets within an application window, a file of image data, or a reference\nto a large database. Composite objects are also supported.</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"views.html\">Views</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">Views are the result of combining a viewer with a particular object. It\nis typically realized by the viewer creating a graphical depiction of a\nparticular object. For example, the display of a GIF image is a view produced\nby a GIF viewer after processing a GIF image file.</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"anchors.html\">Anchors</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">Anchors denote regions of interest within a view. These regions are typically\nselectable and can both initiate and receive link traversal events. Anchors\ncan be either view-specific (anchors made possible by application-specific\nfeatures of the viewer displaying the view) and view-independent (anchors\nwhich can be displayed by any viewer displaying the view).</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"links.html\">Links</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">Links are sets of anchors. Since anchors are associated with views and objects\nat a conceptual level, links can easily relate information stored in different\nformats and accessed by different applications. In this manner, Chimera\ndirectly supports the heterogeneity common in today's modern computing environments.</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"attributes.html\">Attributes</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">All of the previous concepts can have one or more attributes associated\nwith them. An attribute is defined by its name and value. An example attribute\nis (&quot;anchor-x-y&quot;, &quot;20,30&quot;).</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"clients.html\">Clients</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">Clients are applications which make use of Chimera's hypermedia services.\nClients contain contain one or more viewers and manage their access to the\nChimera server. In addition, when a client receives an event from the Chimera\nserver, it is responsible for routing the event to the appropriate viewer.</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\"><A HREF=\"hyperwebs.html\">Hyperwebs</A></TD>\n<TD VALIGN=\"TOP\">A hyperweb is a persistent network of Chimera's hypermedia concepts along\nwith their attributes. Hyperwebs are stored within the document space of\na WWW server allowing them to be referenced and accessed via URLs. Hyperwebs\ncan be hierarchically composed.</TD></TR>\n</TABLE>\n</P>\n\n<P><CENTER><HR SIZE=\"1\" NOSHADE> <TABLE BORDER=\"1\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\n\"2\">\n<CAPTION ALIGN=\"TOP\">Local Site Map</CAPTION>\n<TR>\n<TD BGCOLOR=\"#ffff99\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><A HREF=\"../index.html\">Overview</A></TD>\n<TD BGCOLOR=\"#ffff99\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><A HREF=\"../arch/index.html\">Architecture</A></TD>\n<TD BGCOLOR=\"#ffff99\"><B>Concepts</B></TD>\n<TD BGCOLOR=\"#ffff99\"><A HREF=\"../integration/index.html\">Integration</A></TD>\n<TD BGCOLOR=\"#ffff99\"><P><CENTER><A HREF=\"../papers/index.html\">Papers</A></CENTER></TD></TR>\n</TABLE>\n</CENTER></P>\n\n<P><B>This page is part of the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/chimera/\">Chimera</A>\nweb site.<BR>\nSend feedback and questions to <A HREF=\"mailto:kanderso@ics.uci.edu\">Ken\nAnderson</A>.</B>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 26558.0}
