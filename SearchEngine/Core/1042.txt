The overall grade\nwill be determined 35% from homeworks, 25% from the midterm,\nand 40% from the final exam.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted, but each student must\nlist his or her collaborators in writing for each problem. If a student\nturns in a solution without listing the others who helped produce this\nsolution, this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).\n(See the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html\">ICS \nCheating Policy</a>.)\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Text.</b> Pieprzyk, Hardjono, and Seberry, \n<cite>Fundamentals of Computer Security</cite>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Add/drop policy.</b> All drop requests should be given to\nProf. Goodrich at office hours or by appointment. Drops will be\naccepted only up to the fourth week. Once your drop card has been\nsigned, further coursework from you will not be graded. After the\nseventh week of classes, withdrawals will be allowed only by\npetition and under documented extenuating circumstances, in\naccordance with ICS departmental policy.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Week 1:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nIntroduction.
