Early shuffle methods were motivated by the\nproblem of shuffling a deck of cards. An oblivious shuffle is a distributed\nshuffle executed by a client who permutes an array of encrypted data items\nstored at a server in such a way that the server cannot determine the output\npermutation with probability better than a random guess. Several private cloud\nstorage solutions that obfuscate the access pattern to the data use an\noblivious shuffle as a fundamental building block. We present the Melbourne\nShuffle, a simple and efficient oblivious shuffle that allows a client with\nO(\u221an) memory to obliviously shuffle  an array of size n stored at a server by\nexchanging O(\u221an) messages of size O(\u221an). The Melbourne Shuffle is the first\nprovably secure oblivious shuffle that is not based on sorting.\n\n<p>\nThis talk is based on the paper \u201cThe Melbourne Shuffle: Improving Oblivious\nStorage in the Cloud\u201d by Olga Ohrimenko, Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia\nand Eli Upfal, International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming\n(ICALP), 2014 (to appear). \n\n<p>\n<b>Biography</b>: Roberto Tamassia is the Plastech Professor of Computer Science and\nthe Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Brown University.
