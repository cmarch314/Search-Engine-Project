paper we report on the results of investigations into the instant 4 messaging IM status setting behavior of mobile computer users We conducted 5 an XXX person user survey to illuminate patterns in existing practice and 6 followed up with a six week study of XXX users observed status 7 setting practice with an instrumented IM client 3In this paper we report on the results of a large scale user study investigating 4the status setting and interruption management behavior of emph mobile instant 5messaging IM users The motivation for this study was to inform the design of 6 NomaticIM a tool that supports IM users in setting status messages 87 9 The results demonstrate that in the face of increasingly situated computer usage 1 and an always online culture traditional methods of setting status are 11 failing Using the data collected during our study we show that more flexible 12 approaches to supporting users status setting based on sensor readings and 13 machine learning techniques would effectively improve contextually appropriate 14 awareness messages 8Our results demonstrate that in the face of increasingly situated computer usage 9and an always online culture traditional

r675 r942 11 section Conclusions 2 In conclusion 2 3As computing moves off the desktop and becomes situated in the real world the 4notion of awareness must also change Current techniques of setting viewing 5and inferring awareness must change cite PattersonDN 6 6 7 cite Fogarty 4 concluded that availability was not enough to mitigate 8interruptions our results generally agree but it seems clear that the reason is 9because users are using the desktop practive of leaving messages through IM rather than 1 delaying communication attempts until an appropriate time nomatic trunk 2 8 4 4 UBICOMP design tex r734 r942 1 section The Design of Nomatic IM 2 3 Nomatic IM is a system that is designed around supporting intelligent presence 4 reporting through IM clients The prefix Nomatic is coined from the mix of 5 the words nomad and automatic and refers to our system for collecting 6 descriptions of context correlated with sensors Nomatic leverages 7 off the shelf hardware existing digital practices and mass collaboration to get 8 statistically powerful amounts of data which can then be used as the basis for 9 data mining algorithms to solve challenging cultural and social context 1 representation problems 11 12 The vision of this system is always online with careful 13 attention to automation The basic rationale for why we believe a user would 14 like to participate is centered on interruption management Spiel about 13 15 goes here 16 17 What is this paper about 18 19 Nomatic is a system infrastructure that is designed to support machine 2 learning translations between sensors and context 21 22 Talk about the word Appropriate 23 24 Nomatic IM is designed as an interruption management tool 25 User must be in the loop for it to work 26 Machine learning 27 Automatic context capture 28 No predefined categories 29 Off the shelf technology 3 Multi platform 31 Mass collaboration although this paper only reports on single user learning 32 33 Completely taken from LoCA paper 34 35 36 37 38 subsection Our Use of Context 39 4 We use context as short hand for three types of data a user s current place a 41 user s current activity and a user s current social situation 42 43 begin itemize 44 45 item bfseries Place Place is a way of describing a position in a semantic 46 way It is an inherently ambiguous and subjective label which depends on who is 47 labeling a place why they are labeling it and who they think is going to see 48 the label Unlike place position is a piece of information possibly difficult 49 to gather which describes where something is It is usually described in a 5 coordinate system such as latitude and longitude but may also be described in 51 other ways based on use and technology Regardless of representation position 52 unambiguously maps where locations are e g 31N 117W 3 miles north of Exit 53 14 on highway I 5 etc Position to place is not a one to one mapping Not 54 only can a position have many place names but a single place name may map to 55 many positions e g home work a Yoshinoya restaurant an IKEA store An 56 excellent discussion of the issues surrounding position and place can be found 57 in cite hightower 3 58 59 item bfseries Activity Activity is also a subjective description of what a 6 person is currently doing Much of the same ambiguity that surrounds place also 61 surrounds activity A person may be walking talking on a cell phone having a 62 conversation laughing exercising looking for the subway all at the same 63 time 64 65 item bfseries Social Situation This is the way in which a person would describe 66 their current activity as it relates to other people It includes situations such as being alone 67 being in a crowd in a meeting on a date etc Again this is a 68 highly subjective way of describing part of a person s context end itemize 69 7 In fact these three elements of context are closely tied together To say that 71 you are at a theater likely means that you are also watching a movie and in a 72 crowd of strangers To say that you are flying to Sydney also implies that you 73 are on a plane So we do not suggest that these three types of context 74 are independent but rather they are different lenses through which we observe 75 situations 76 77 When necessary some of the ambiguity of context can be eliminated by conforming 78 to an ontology hierarchical or otherwise GIS systems such as the U S Census bureau s 79 cite TIGER frequently impose such a structure on 8 the description of places so that each position has exactly one well 81 characterized label perhaps light industrial park or shopping mall 82 Much work in the pervasive and ubiquitous computing community on activity 83 recognition takes this tactic as well Many algorithms are made tractable by 84 the exclusive and unambiguous description of activities in progress e g 85 cite patterson 5 bao2 4 86 87 Nomatic through its mass collaborative nature rejects the imposition of a 88 strict ontology and supports the emergent creation of communal understandings 89 of context that will arise through shared use We allow users to arbitrarily 9 tag locations in the style of de li cious cite delicious Flickr 91 cite flickr and Etsy cite etsy so that Nomatic can grow and change 92 with community use 93 94 95 The first step in motivating the mass collaboration of crowds is to provide an 96 incentive We believe that instant messaging IM is just such a motivation 97 98 The Human Computer Interaction and Computer Supported Cooperative Work 99 literature has thoroughly documented the value and use of awareness 1 technologies to support and improve distributed group work 1 1 cite Heath91 Dourish92 Dourish93 Gutwin98 Milewski Tang 1 1 2 Ethnographic studies of IM have shown that the awareness 1 3 associated with the online offline status line of an IM client has 1 4 substantial value in the maintenance dyadic human 1 5 relationships cite Nardi Nardi 2 Nardi 5 1 6 1 7 However the computing context in which IM has been used has been rapidly 1 8 changing Until recently most users of IM were primarily using desktop 1 9 computers Computing has changed substantially in recent years such that 11 laptops sales are outpacing desktop computer sales cite laptopsales and IM 111 clients are now available on mobile phones This means that the context 112 provided by a label that says online vs offline is no longer sufficient 113 to provide information to achieve the positive externalities mentioned in 114 Nardi s work cite Nardi 5 Some studies indicate that 13 of all IM 115 dialogue is simply 116 related to negotiating availability cite Handel 2 117 Increasingly individuals are always online 118 The difference is that now a person might be online but not available They 119 may be driving giving a presentation using the same hardware to make a phone 12 call or incur fees to receive IM messages Online no longer means that a 121 user can gracefully handle an interruption 122 123 At the same time this new hardware is being built with sensors for other 124 purposes 125 begin itemize 126 item bfseries Wi Fi 8 2 11x hardware included for wireless networking can be used for 127 localization cite PlaceLab MicrosoftEarth 128 item bfseries Accelerometers included for hard drive protection can be used 129 to detect changes in motion and orientation 13 item bfseries Microphones included for speech communication can be used to 131 analyze ambient noise 132 item bfseries Light Sensors included for automatic screen brightness control 133 can be used to cue context understanding of space 134 end itemize 135 136 137 To adapt to this new reality we have developed a context aware 138 open source footnote Nomatic Gaim is licensed under a combination of GPL and 139 other redistributable licenses cross platform footnote it compiles and runs on 14 Windows Linux and Mac OS platforms and cross protocol footnote MSN Messenger 141 Yahoo Messenger AIM AOL iChat Jabber Google and others instant messenger 142 client called Nomatic Gaim see figure fig screenshots 1 It is the merger of two existing projects 143 Gaim cite Gaim and Place Lab cite lamarca 5 with the Nomatic 144 mass collaboration context collection system Unlike previous IM clients this 145 one reports more nuanced context information in the status line see figure 146 fig screenshots 2 When a user 147 sets their context information their position is simultaneously queried from 148 the Place Lab system These two pieces of information are then alternately 149 reported on the awareness status line The information is also anonymized and 15 sent to the Nomatic server over a secure channel where a database entry is made 151 matching the position with the context information provided Figures 152 fig screenshots 3 fig screenshots 4 shows other clients 153 displaying Nomatic Gaim status 154 155 156 157 158 As exciting as this new way of using IM is there are some clear concerns about 159 privacy that need to be addressed So to understand potential user concerns and 16 to develop models for automatically managing privacy we conducted a small 161 Wizard Of Oz pilot study with users to direct our efforts 162 163 164 nomatic trunk 2 8 4 4 UBICOMP discussion tex r939 r942 5 15 1 5 25 2 5 3 5 4 To do graph 188 5 5 To do graph 134 5 6 Look at just the basic stats w o Chi2 5 7 5 8 5 9 51 511

support synchronous communication between networked 4computers Users maintain a buddy list of other users with whom they can 5initiate a real time text conversation by clicking on the buddy s name or other 6representation When an initiating user types a message the receiving user s 7computer displays a pop up window with the text of the message To support 8mutual awareness of buddy status buddy lists are often augmented with two types 9of real time status cues a simple indication of whether the remote user is 1 offline online but away from the computer online but busy or online The 11second type of cue is a short phrase that a user authors which is broadcast to 12all of his or her remote buddies From this base variations too numerous to 13enumerate have emerged 414 5 Awareness technologies are facing a have a long history in computer mediated communication 6 technologies As computing moves off the desktop and becomes situated in the 7 real world the notion of awareness must also change Current techniques of 8 setting viewing and inferring awareness must change cite PattersonDN 6 15IM is not the first example of system which provides digital awareness Similar 16systems have been providing insight into the physical context of distributed 17communities of practice cite Wenger98 Early examples include the Unix 18command w which allowed users to see whether other users on the same 19mainframe computer were typing As individuals began to work on personal 2 computers utilities like finger allowed insight into remote U I activity and 21current project status Greater bandwidth and access to advanced peripherals 22enabled richer remote awareness through systems like MediaSpaces cite Bly93 23and Portholes cite Dourish93 924 1 In this paper we report on the results of evaluating awareness technology in the 11 scope of mobile instant messaging users We look at what users self report they 12 want what users do and how computing technology can support them 25In the physical world a popular office awareness system is the in out board 26Such a bulletin board is maintained at a common location like a reception area 27to give people in small to medium sized office suites knowledge of where the 28inhabitants are Digitizing such systems cite Moran99 for hybrid 29ecologies cite Crabtree2 7 combines the benefits of the physical 3 system such as its location with those of digital systems such as automatic 31and remote updating 1332 14 Many of the first applications on networked computers were developed to help 15 coordinate the actions of distributed collaborators The initial focus of these 16 technologies were primary actions better term Examples of this type of 17 software progressed from email and file transfer to VOIP and collaborative 18 document editting At the 19 same time technologies which focussed on peripheral awareness of networked 2 collaborators also emerged These technologies weren t directly associated with 21 a particular task and by themselves didn t seem to serve much of a purpose 22 However they still managed to thrive because they provided social support 23 which smoothed the execution of more primary activities Such out of band 24 contextual presence awareness is an aspect of outeraction a term which Nardi coined 25 to contrast its supporting role in the more direct processes of 26 interaction cite Nardi 33More recently researchers have specially emph built systems to explore the effects of 34such systems in a emph mobile context The Awarenex system examined the user 35interface of a mobile emph mobile awareness cues cite Tang 1 Another 36implemented system PePe cite Lehinkoinen2 6 examined how users described 37the locations that they visited In the commercial arena micro blogging 38services such as Twitter cite twitter and Jaiku cite jaiku have been 39developed to support user entered status from mobile devices 274 28 One of the first awareness technologies that was developed was the Unix command 29 finger This network protocol allowed people to post a free text description of 3 their current status which any user could query using a specialized 31 protocol 41Other researchers have evaluated the role of IM status cues in emph existing IM 42systems from a number of perspectives including its social role among 43teens cite grinter2 2 how it functions in physically distributed workplace 44teams cite Handel 2 and how it eases social connections in the 45workplace cite Nardi 3246 33 Portholes was an early example of a system which faciliated knowledge of a 34 remote collaborator s presence that utilized streaming video cite Dourish93 Unlike finger Portholes was 35 structured more as a continuous push technology which published presence 36 information to a predefined and preapproved group of people 47Because of our interest in computing s trend toward a user being always online 48in this paper we focussed on issues of mobility the ensuing inappropriate 49interruptions and the resulting status management behavior of these users Our 5 motivation is to inform the design of NomaticIM which has the goal of enabling users 51to enter appropriate contextual status messages in IM 3752 38 the UBICOMP pervasive computing literature Connexus AwarePhone FriendZone iCams 39 4 In the commercial arena twitter Jaiku 41 42 Make a statement that we are going to call this information presence 43 44 Presence technologies are designed with many characteristics which support 45 thier use These characteristics are utilized by people to help continuously 46 negotiate privacy boundaries between participants cite PalenD 3 These 47 characteristics include 48 begin itemize 49 5 item bfseries Push Pull Some presence systems such as portholes and status 51 lines in instant messaging IM employ a push model in which status is broadcast to 52 remote observers automatically Other systems like finger employ a pull model in which interested 53 parties must electronically request the status A pull model allows the gateway 54 to the presence information to be monitored so that knowledge of who is reading 55 your status can be viewed Other systems enable a push model that is triggered 56 by rules that a user specifies cite Intel paper 57 58 item bfseries Authorization Awareness systems can vary along an axis of 59 permission Awareness may be publically published such as with a MySpace status 6 systems may be limited to a group of people such as with instant messaging or 61 they may be explicitly structured as dyadic messages as in cite something by 62 Intel Research on cell phones Blocking restriction and group management techniques then mediate the 63 publication of presence information 64 65 item bfseries Contextualization Some systems attempt to label the users 66 current context automatically IM statuses such as idle online and offline that 67 are automatically inferred from the activation of screen 68 savers local U I interaction and network connectivity are an example of 69 contextualization More advanced systems attempt 7 to automatically characterize the qualities of a location and publish those for 71 a user cite Jaiku 72 73 item bfseries User intervention When a system provides some sort of 74 interpretation of context beyond simply reporting a sensor reading on a user s 75 computing platform presence systems can also be characterized by how much 76 intervention they require from a user before broadcasting that presence 77 information 78 79 item bfseries Synchronization Some systems primarily through the practice in 8 which they are used provide a more asynchronous view into peoples presence 81 information Facebook and twitter are examples of asynchronous presence 82 publishing in which presence information is not typically understood to be 83 real time In contrast instant messaging s online offline presence 84 information is understood to be instaneously accurate modulo intervention by a 85 user 86 87 end itemize 88 89 In this paper we present the results of two related studies of an IM presence 9 system which attempts to advance the start of the art in 91 contextualization and user intervention The first study is a survey of mobile 92 instant messaging users and their self reported behavior around presence 93 reporting The second study is an observational study in which users instant 94 messaging systems were instrumented so that mobility and presence reporting 95 could be observed in situ The third piece is an analysis of the data from the 96 second study about how sensors can be used to predict user s desired presence 97 descriptions 98 99 Should this be three papers 53The contribution of this paper is to add to our understanding of evolving 54practices of mobile communication management by surveying a emph large number 55 N 447 of emph mobile IM users who are actively using emph existing 56systems in their daily lives Through this approach we are able to mitigate 57effects due to novelty of new systems and small numbers of participants 58although we are limited to behavior which can be reliably self reported nomatic trunk 2 8 4 4 UBICOMP paper tex
