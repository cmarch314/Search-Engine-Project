In this paper, we settle therefore on an easier problem of computing high-confidence lower bounds and propose an algorithm based on importance sampling and Markov inequality for it. However, a straight-forward application of Markov inequality often yields poor lower bounds because it uses only one sample. We therefore propose several new schemes that extend it to multiple samples. Empirically, we show that our new schemes are quite powerful, often yielding substantially higher (better) lower bounds than state-of-the-art schemes.\r\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r186.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8513.0}
