{"text": "INFORMATICS 41 DAVID G KAY UC IRVINE FALL 2 11 Lab Assignment This lab assignment is due at the end of lab on Friday September 23 The next lab assignment Lab Assignment 1 will be available on the web by Friday and will be due the following Friday at the end of lab we ll follow that pattern all quarter a Choose a partner for this assignment and make sure the TA knows who your partner is Remember that you ll choose a different partner for each lab assignment so you ll work with this partner only this Friday All your computer based work on this and every lab assignment must follow the pair programming guidelines b It s especially important that you be able to receive electronic mail sent to your UCInet ID you uci edu You may redirect this mail to another account of your choosing see the course reference sheet but don t let that mail go unread Also be sure your UCInet account doesn t exceed its disk quota When it does you won t receive official Email With your partner test this out by sending each other Email at your UCI addresses There s nothing to turn in for this part c Locate and launch the DrRacket software Each DrRacket window has two panes The bottom half is the interactions or transcript window where you can type Scheme expressions and see the interpreter evaluate them immediately To type expressions or programs you wish to save you will use the top pane the definitions window and click Run at the top right to evaluate the code this makes the code available for use in the interactions window below The DrRacket system actually includes many different versions of Scheme We ll be using a graduated series of languages that build up to full Scheme step by step in DrRacket this series is called the How to Design Programs teaching languages One might wonder why it s necessary to take these baby steps the answer is that by restricting the language features to those that a student needs at the moment DrRacket can provide error messages that describe the actual problem more clearly Programming language error messages are notoriously inaccurate The compiler is just a computer program so it can t know for sure what the programmer intended when it finds something wrong But with these different language levels DrRacket does better than most We will start with the Beginning Student language if it s not the level currently installed look for Programming language in the lower pane change it in the Language menu and click Run again Most modern programming languages provide some basic features and allow the programmer to select specific specialized features for the task at hand e g network programming or animations or cryptography We call these specialized collections libraries or teachpacks in DrRacket For much of the course we will use a teachpack called picturing programs rkt this supports the image processing and animation described in the textbook The ICS lab machines should already be set up with DrRacket Beginning Student Language and the picturing programs rkt teachpack Chapter of the textbook describes how to install the picturing programs rkt teachpack on your own machine There s nothing to turn in for this part d Experiment with DrRacket to get familiar with it following the suggestions below One person drives types the other navigates observes questions suggests if you don t know what this is about go back and read the pair programming guidelines The point of this assignment is to get you familiar with the mechanics of DrRacket Scheme and pair programming Try evaluating some expressions like 3 4 5 and expt 2 5 and gcd 15 23 In DrScheme calculating greatest common divisors is predefined built in Type in some definitions of symbols in the interactions window like define number of students 54 and define number of staff 7 and then try number of students number of staff There s nothing to turn in for this part e The driver and navigator should switch roles now Even though you haven t typed anything in the definitions window click the Run button before doing these image processing exercises that activates the picturing programs rkt teachpack But don t click Run again while you re working on this part You re working in the interactions window and clicking Run clears it out before you can save it Do exercise 1 2 1 in the Picturing Programs textbook you can find it on line at www picturingprograms com As the book suggests pick smallish images DrRacket can handle a 12 megapixel image from a digital camera but when the time comes to submit your work huge images will clog up Checkmate Switch roles then do exercise 1 2 2 Switch again and do exercise 1 2 3 Do exercises 1 2 4 1 2 5 and 1 2 6 switching roles after each one Save a copy of the interactions window that shows your work for this part using Save Other and Save Interactions As from the File menu A good name for the file would be lab e rkt stick with a naming pattern like this for the rest of the quarter It s fine if your interactions show false starts and mistakes it s also fine if you just produce a short clean copy Edit the file to make sure it includes your name and your partner s submit this file via Checkmate Don t know what Checkmate is Look at the What to do this week section of the course syllabus f The driver and navigator should switch roles again The factorial function written in mathematical notation with an exclamation point so n factorial would be n is used in calculating how many ways there are to arrange things like the number of different ways to arrange five students in a row The value of n is n n 1 n 2 1 so 5 5 4 3 2 1 12 Type the following function definition into the definitions window Actually do the typing so you can get used to the way it works don t just copy and paste We ll go over the details of this code in class some time soon for now this is just a typing exercise and you shouldn t try too hard to figure out how it works If you re not used to typing programs be careful to type accurately Watch what happens every time you type a right parenthesis fact number number Compute n n factorial check expect fact 1 check expect fact 5 12 define fact lambda n cond n 1 is 1 by definition else n fact n 1 Notice how DrRacket indents and highlights blocks of code so you don t lose your place Don t forget to click Run Now try evaluating expressions like fact 5 fact 5 fact 12 and fact 5 Next evaluate fact fact 5 Scheme can handle long numbers effortlessly but any computer is finite what do you think might happen if you evaluate fact fact 5 You can try it but you ll have to stop the evaluation click the stop sign if you don t want to wait until the machine finally runs out of memory Save a copy of the interactions window that shows your work for this part as described in part e Make sure both partners names are in the saved file g Switch roles again Follow this role switching pattern in all your lab work this quarter we won t keep mentioning it Scheme represents and manipulates numbers more flexibly than most programming languages in part because it doesn t tie what the user sees to the way the hardware stores the number What is the value produced by pi 2 The result is prefixed by i which signals inexact representation this means that the decimal number may be rounded off as the value of pi would have to be Enter this definition you can copy and paste it into the definitions window define decimal format lambda num string number number string exact inexact num Then evaluate decimal format pi 2 Type it at the bottom of the definitions window and click Run that will save you from retyping it later Using decimal format gives you a more human readable number in case you need to produce polished results There are also ways to specify the precise number of digits but that s for another time Next evaluate 4 3 and 125 22 7 DrScheme indicates that the results are repeating decimals with a bar over the repeating digits Evaluate fact 5 expt 7 2 this result repeats too but not in a discernible pattern Save a copy of the interactions window that shows your work for this part so far Now go to the Language menu select Choose Language and click Show Details Then select Mixed Fractions Next evaluate again the four expressions above See why it s convenient to have them in the definitions window These results in fractional form are not what we expect to see on a computer but they re useful in further calculations because nothing is lost by rounding off to a decimal representation Try some other divisions Save a copy of the interactions window that shows your work for this second part following the instructions in part e above Notice that the fractions in the file are saved in a slightly different form than the one DrScheme uses in the interactions window Combine both files for this part into one remembering to include both partners names and submit the file via Checkmate h Remember that each partner must complete a partner evaluation form and submit it individually Do this by connecting to eee uci edu and choosing the Survey tool for Informatics 41 Make sure you know your partner s name first and last so you can evaluate the right person Please complete your evaluation by the end of the day on Friday or Saturday morning at the latest It only takes a couple of minutes and not doing it hurts your participation score What to turn in Submit via Checkmate the interactions transcripts for parts e f and g above It would be an excellent idea to go back and re read parts e f and g carefully now to make sure you ve completed all the steps specified Also remember that each student must complete a partner evaluation form by logging in to eee uci edu and selecting the Survey tool these evaluations contribute to your class participation score Get in the habit of doing this every week Based in part on ICS H21 and H22 assignments by David G Kay from Fall 2 3 and earlier modified by

We call these specialized collections <strong>libraries</strong> (or &quot;teachpacks&quot; in DrRacket). For much of the course, we will use a teachpack called <span class=\"Code-in-Body\">picturing-programs.rkt</span>; this supports the image processing and animation described in the textbook.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">The ICS lab machines should already be set up with DrRacket, Beginning Student Language, and the <span class=\"Code-in-Body\">picturing-programs.rkt</span> teachpack.

There's nothing to turn in for this part.</font></p>\n<p> <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"><b>(d)</b> Experiment with DrRacket to get\n  familiar with it, following the suggestions below. One person &quot;drives&quot; (types); the other &quot;navigates&quot; (observes, questions, suggests); if you don't know what this is about, go back and read the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/pair.html\">pair programming guidelines</a>. The point of this assignment is to get you familiar with the mechanics of DrRacket, Scheme, and pair programming.</font></p>\n<p> <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Try evaluating some expressions, like </font>\n<code>(* 3 4 5)</code>\n  <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"> and </font>\n  <code>(expt&#160;2\n    5)\n  </code>\n    <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"> and </font>\n    <code>(gcd 15 230)</code><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">.  (In DrScheme, calculating\n        greatest common divisors is predefined (built in)). </font></p>\n<p> <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Type in some definitions of symbols in the\n  interactions window, like </font>\n  <code>(define\n    number-of-students 54)</code>\n    <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"> and </font>\n    <code>(define number-of-staff 7)</code>\n  <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"> and then try </font>\n    <code>(+  number-of-students number-of-staff)</code><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">.

(But don't click Run again while you're working on this part.  You're working in the \ninteractions window and clicking Run clears it out before you can save it.)</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Do exercise 1.2.1 in the <em>Picturing Programs</em> textbook; you can find it on line at <a href=\"http://www.picturingprograms.com\"><code>www.picturingprograms.com</code></a>.  (As the book suggests, pick smallish images.  DrRacket can handle a 12-megapixel image from a digital camera, but when the time comes to submit your work, huge images will clog up Checkmate.)</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Switch roles, then do exercise 1.2.2. Switch again and do exercise 1.2.3. Do exercises 1.2,4, 1.2.5, and 1.2.6, switching roles after each one.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Save a copy of the interactions window that shows\n  your work for this part (using Save Other and Save Interactions As from the File menu).  A\n  good name for the file would be <code>lab0e.rkt</code>; stick with a naming pattern like this for the rest of the quarter.\n  It&#39;s fine if your interactions show false starts and mistakes; it&#39;s also fine\n  if you just produce a short, clean copy.  Edit the file to make sure it\nincludes your name and your partner&#39;s; submit this file via Checkmate. (Don't know what Checkmate is? Look at the &quot;What to do this week&quot; section of the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/\">course syllabus</a>).</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"><b>(f)</b> The &quot;driver&quot; and &quot;navigator&quot; should switch roles again. The factorial function (written\n  in mathematical notation with an exclamation point, so &quot;<i>n</i> factorial&quot; would be <i>n</i>!)\n  is used in calculating how many ways there are to arrange things (like the number of different ways to arrange five students in a row).  The value\n  of <i>n</i>! is <i>n</i> &middot; (<i>n</i>-1) &middot; (<i>n</i>-2) &middot; ... &middot; 1, so 5!\n  = 5 &middot; 4 &middot; 3 &middot; 2 &middot; 1 = 120.</font></p>\n<p> <font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Type the following function definition into\n  the definitions window.  Actually do the typing so you can get used to the\n  way it works; don&#39;t just copy and paste.  (We&#39;ll go over the details\n  of this code in class some time soon; for now, this is just a typing exercise\nand you shouldn&#39;t try too hard to figure out how it works.
