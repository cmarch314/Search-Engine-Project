There are\nvery few algorithms we have shied away from including in OEChem, and many\nof the methods are new, unique and powerful.  This gives OEChem a very rich\ninterface, yet to gain this efficiency and power OEChem may force you to\nthink about problems in ways your are not accustomed to doing.  We hope\nthat you benefit from the experience.  If you find that you cannot or it is\ndifficult to carry out a task with OEChem, please contact us.\n\n<P>\nOEChem has several layers of interfaces to most of its functionality.\nThere are \"high-level\" interfaces, which provide the user with an enormous\namount of power with minimal code.  This level is exemplified by the second\ncode listing in the chapter \"Reading and Writing Molecules\" (see below).\nIn this example, the functionality of the \"babel\" file-format conversion\nprogram is re-implemented in about 10 lines of code.  While this is trivial\nto write and understand (<i>maybe after you've finished the manual</i>), it\nshould not belie the fact that OEChem is carrying out an enormous amount\nof work under the surface.\n\n<P>\nA perhaps \"mid-level\" interface in OEChem is the <i>generic data</i>\ninterface.  Once you are familiar with OEChem's molecules, you may find\nthat none of them are specifically tailored to your task.  Rather than\nhaving to delve deeply into the molecule api and derive your own molecule\nfor the task, you can simply <i>extend</i> the api of molecules at run-time\nto suite your needs.  While this functionality is perhaps not for the\nfirst-day user, it certainly doesn't require a stout heart.\n\n<P>\nFinally, for advanced programmers, OEChem provides access to nearly all of\nthe detailed control of our functions.  OEChem molecules have a simple api\nwhich can be used to derived your own molecules.  The free-function heavy\napi discussed above then lets you have access to much of OEChem's power\nwithout having to implement an enormous molecule api yourself.  Similarly,\nmany of the functions that are wrapped in high level functions (like the\nmolecule readers and writers) are also available directly to the user at\nthe low level.  For instance, while you many use <code>oemolostreams</code> to\nwrite molecules to output, you can also use the <code>OEWriteMDLFile</code>\nfunctions for more direct access.\n\n<P>\nIf you ever have difficulty implementing the functionality you desire with\nthe OEChem interface you already know, look deeper.  It will often be the\ncase that a lower level function will allow you the control you are\nseeking.\n\n<P>\n\n<DIV CLASS=\"navigation\">\n<p><hr>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node253.html\"><img src=\"../icons/previous.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Previous Page\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node251.html\"><img src=\"../icons/up.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Up One Level\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node255.html\"><img src=\"../icons/next.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Next Page\"></A></td><td width=\"100%\" rowspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"center\" align=\"right\" height=\"56\" background=\"../icons/title_bkgd.gif\" colspan=4 class=\"navigation\">OEChem - Python Theory Manual\n<BR>\nVersion 1.3.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_1.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"contents.html\"><img src=\"../icons/contents.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Contents\"></A></td>\n<td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_2.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"genindex.html\"><img src=\"../icons/index.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Index\"></A></td>\n</tr></table>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Previous:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node253.html\">29.2 Objects and Free-Functions</A>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Up:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node251.html\">29.
