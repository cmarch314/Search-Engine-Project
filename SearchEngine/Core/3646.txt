Our construction\nis based on the Koebe\u2013Andreev\u2013Thurston circle packing theorem, and\nuses a novel type of Voronoi diagram for circle packings that is\ninvariant\nunder Mobius transformations, defined using three-dimensional\nhyperbolic\ngeometry. We also use circle packing to construct planar Lombardi\ndrawings of a special class of 4-regular planar graphs, the medial\ngraphs\nof polyhedral graphs, and we show that not every 4-regular planar\ngraph\nhas a planar Lombardi drawing. We have implemented our algorithm for\n3-connected planar cubic graphs.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3646.0}
