UML was adopted as the Object Management \nGroup's (OMG) standard notation for representing systems, including \nsoftware and business systems. \n\n<p>\n\nUML provides notations to describe the component (class and object) \nstructure of a system, the behavior of system components (using \nuse-case, communication sequence and state diagrams), and the \ndeployment of software components. UML also provides a formal \nspecification language, which can be used to describe constraints, \nand an activity diagram, which can be used to describe processes.\n\n<p>\nThis presentation will describe UML using examples and outline its \nuse in object-oriented software development.\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\nEd Colbert has taught and consulted on Ada, object-oriented methods, \nand software engineering since 1982. He created the Colbert \nObject-Oriented Software Development method (OOSD), which supports \nlanguages such as Ada, C++, and SmallTalk. NASA Langley Research Center\nrecently used OOSD for a Software Engineering Process Guide, available \non the Web at sw-eng.LaRC.NASA.gov/guidebook/. Ed is currently \nconsulting on applying UML to projects with TRW and others. Ed is the \nchair of the ACM SIGAda Patterns Working Group. He has delivered \npresentations and tutorials at OOPSLA, Object Expo, LOOK, OOP, SCOOP, \nTri-Ada and Ada UK. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan \n(M.S. Computer and Communications Sciences and BS Honors in Chemistry \nand Biology).\n\n<p>\n\n<font size=+1>\n<strong>Coordinator: </strong>A.
