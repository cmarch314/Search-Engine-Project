Lewis Johnson USC ISI CSE David RedmilesUCI IRUS The 1998 California Software Symposium CSS 98 is the eighth in a series of annual meetings on software engineering co sponsored by UCI s Irvine Research Unit in Software IRUS and USC s Center for Software Engineering CSE The purpose of these symposia is to bring together researchers and practitioners to share ideas and experiences Emphasis is on early dissemination of new ideas and empirical evaluation and on experience with software techniques on actual projects We feel confident you will find that CSS 98 continues the tradition of high quality peer reviewed presentations and panel discussions This year s featured topic Software Engineering in a Fully Connected World is complemented by presentations on such topical items as social and organizational implications of software Web and Internet related standards and technologies Computer Supported Cooperative Work CSCW workflow and process metrics including the COCOMO II project Off the Shelf OTS technology software comprehension and legal implications These topics are presented in a variety of formats paper presentations panels a keynote address and new this year a mini tutorial For more information Debra A Brodbeck UCI IRUS brodbeck ics uci edu 949 824 226 Keynote Address Networking Knotworking and Net Knitting Maintaining Connection in the New Economy Is the fully connected world all attributable to technology Obviously there is social work that is necessary for building real human networks I have been studying how people work across organizational boundaries investigating the work of consultants contractors cross company business partners experts such as attorneys and reference librarians high level managers brokers such as technology transfer advocates and workers in customer vendor relationships I contrast this kind of cross linking work to teamwork which has the been focus of most CSCW research My research shows that a significant amount of effort goes into constructing construing and maintaining social networks and varying social presences in cross linked work Technologies such as the telephone and the Internet are crucial to this work though face to face communication persists as an important tool Knotworking and net knitting are forms of working within a network I will discuss organizational and technological implications of these activities that characterize work in today s economy Biography Bonnie A Nardi nardi research att com is an anthropologist in AT T Labs Research in Menlo Park California She has lived and studied in
