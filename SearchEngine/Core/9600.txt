Here are the\nrules:\n\nTroll is played with a reversi set.\nThere 2 players Black and White.\nEach of them chooses two opposite edges on the board.\nWhite starts.\nHe plays a tile facing its color on any free square of the board\nexepted on corners or on opponents edges. If he wants to, he must\nplay an othello move which turns back opponent tiles. He must turn\nback all opponent tiles catched by his move like in othello, but the\ndifference with othello is that it is allowed to play moves which\ndon't catch opponent tiles.\nThe winner is the first one who manages to do a path connecting his\ntwo opposite edges. Two tiles diagonally aside are not continuous in\na path. The corners belong to all edges.\n\nexample of game :\n   a b c d e f g h\n  . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . .@. . . . .\n2 . . . .@. . . . .\n3 . .X.X.@. . . . .\n4 .X.@.@.@.X.X.X. .\n5 . .@.X. .@.@.X.X.\n6 . . . . . .@. . .\n7 . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . .\n\nBlack to play : he can play at b2, c2, h2, e1, c7... and he plays at d5\n\n   a b c d e f g h\n  . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . .@. . . . .\n2 . . . .@. . . . .\n3 . .X.X.@. . . . .\n4 .X.@.X.@.X.X.X. .\n5 . .@.X.X.X.X.X.X.\n6 . . . . . .@. . .\n7 . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . .\n\nHe has not won because there is no perpendicular link between b3 and a4.\nBut he is able to do a continuous path by playing a3, a5 or b6.
