In particular, we consider\ntime-windowed queries for skylines in &#8477;<sup><i>d</i></sup> and\nconvex hulls in &#8477;<sup>2</sup>. For\nskyline problems, we provide a data structure using near-linear space\nand preprocessing that can report the skyline in time proportional to\nits size. For convex hull problems, we provide a data structures using\nnear-linear space and preprocessing that can in polylogarithmic time\nanswer various convex hull queries, including gift wrapping, hull\nreporting, tangent finding, linear programming, line decision, line\nstabbing, membership, and containment.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Michael J.
