can be solved in quadratic time by constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph bipartiteness testing algorithm we achieve subquadratic times for general objects and O n log n times for balls in R d or simple polygons in the plane by using geometric data structures separator based divide and conquer and plane sweep techniques respectively We also contrast the complexity of

from a graph or a n approximation to the maximum independent set of the same graph despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of approximation schemes for 1 2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations better than n1 for independent set However for some other pairs of problems such as hitting set and set cover we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no easier than solving either
