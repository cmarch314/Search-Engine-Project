{"text": "Ucigame Getting Started Home Getting Started Reference Introduction to Java Gallery Ucigame is designed for people who want to design and program 2D computer games This page will give you some useful information to get started Programming is in Java Computer programming with Ucigame uses a very popular language called Java Java is a versatile language which can be used to make all types of computer applications Java has several features designed primarily for large systems created by teams of many people In Ucigame we generally ignore those features Many good books on Java have been written and you may want to own one However those books generally tell you much more about the language then your will need for writing many Ucigame programs so feel free to skip whatever doesn t seem relevant or comprehensible How to get started You need to have version 1 5 or later of Java which can be freely downloaded from Oracle which now owns Sun Microsystems the company which created Java It s also called the J2SE Development Kit JDK 5 or 6 or 7 Start at Oracle s download page You will also need a copy of ucigame jar which contains all the code necessary for Ucigame programming Download it by clicking on the link If you are using Internet Explorer ucigame jar may get renamed to ucigame zip In this case rename it back to ucigame jar Now you need to put ucigame jar in a place where it can be found when you want to compile and run Java programs that use it There are two main options This option may be best if you are running on your own computer When Java was installed its Java Runtime Environment or JRE was put on your computer In Windows it might be in a folder called C Program Files Java jre1 6 Note that it will have the version number such as 1 6 as part of the name Inside that folder is a subfolder called lib and inside of lib is a subfolder called ext Look inside that and you ll see several jar files Any jar file in this folder is accessible to any Java program running the corresponding version of Java It s possible to have more than one version of Java on a computer which can lead to much confusion Copy ucigame jar into this lib ext folder and you re ready This option may be best if you are running on a shared computer Move ucigame jar into the folder where you will be writing your game programs Now you need to tell Java to look in ucigame jar it knows to look in the lib ext folder without you telling it to but nowhere else At the command prompt type in SET CLASSPATH CLASSPATH ucigame jar This command adds to the classpath that is the list of places Java looks for class files probably need other options for non Windows and for specific programming environments If you get an error message like package ucigame does not exists when trying to compile or an exception like java lang NoClassDefFoundError ucigame Ucigame when trying to run that s a sure sign that there s a mismatch between your CLASSPATH and the location of ucigame jar Once you have ucigame jar and the classpath squared away the steps for creating a Ucigame game application are Create a file called YourGame java with the source code for your game in it This is a big step of course Lot s of sample programs on this site can serve as models At the command prompt enter javac YourGame java This compiles your program which means that the java file is transformed into one or more class files The class files are used to actually run the game You may get compiler errors if so fix them and repeat the previous step Make sure that YourGame class is now in your folder Run your game with java YourGame YourGame The name of the game has to be repeated on the command line This is something unique to Ucigame and isn t true of Java programs in general You can stop the game by pressing the Escape key Running Ucigame games as applications and applets Java programs can run as applications or as applets Applets are Java classes that extend java applet Applet Since the Ucigame class extends JApplet which extends Applet your game extends Applet Applets usually override four methods from the Applet class init start stop and destroy the Ucigame class does this for you Applets are run inside another program typically a web browser Java applications have a public static void main String method that provides a starting point for execution Typically applications are run on the command line with java ClassName Inside an Integrated Development Environment an application can be started by a button press or a menu option Since the Ucigame class has a public static void main method and also extends Applet your game that extends Ucigame be run either way Creating and running Ucigame games with Eclipse Eclipse www eclipse org is a powerful and extendible set of tools for editing managing and running Java programs and other languages too Here are some tips for happy co existence between Ucigame and Eclipse To start from Eclipse s menu select File New Java Project The recommended choice under Project Layout is Use project folder as root for sources and class files although either option will work fine An important step is to make sure ucigame jar is available The file can be located anywhere on your disk a convenient location is the top level of your project From Eclipse s menu select Project Properties Java Build Path Libraries tab Add External JARs Then navigate to the location of ucigame jar on your computer and click Open Finally click OK in the Properties dialog box To activate Eclipse s nifty Code Completion pop up boxes you need to provide Eclipse with the JavaDocs for Ucigame Download ucigame javadocs zip perhaps to the same location as ucigame jar and unzip the file You will see a subdirectory named UcigameJavaDocs From Eclipse s menu select Project Properties Java Build Path Libraries tab Expand the tree under ucigame jar Highligh Javadoc location and click on Edit Use Browse to navigate to the location of UcigameJavaDocs on your computer and click OK Finally click OK in the Properties dialog box When you create the primary class for your game make sure that ucigame Ucigame is specified as the Superclass It is usually convenient to store image files and sound files in their own subdirectories If you do this these subdirectories should go in the same directory as the class files Eclipse will be happy to launch your game as an application or as an applet Eclipse provides a built in appletviewer that will run your Ucigame game if it is running as an applet In most cases you will need to tell the appletview what the correct width and height of the window are A call to window size is ignored when a Ucigame game is running as an applet To do this from Eclipse s menu select Run Run Configurations your class s name under Java Applet x Parameters Put the correct values in the Width and Height areas and click Apply You may prefer to run your game as an application To do this from Eclipse s menu select Run Run As Java Application Eclipse will show you a Select Java Application dialog box where you can tell Eclipse the name of the class which has the main method Choose the option which has your game class s name and press OK You will now see an error message from Ucigame Please repeat the program name For example Java MyGame MyGame Press OK From Eclipse s menu select Run Run Configurations your class s name under Java Application x Arguments In the Program arguments area type in the class name Press Apply and then Run Commonly encountered problems At the command prompt I entered javac java and got this message javac is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file The computer is not able to find the Java compiler program javac exe First make sure you have the Java Development Kit JDK installed You should have a directory with a name like C Program Files Java jdk1 6 2 bin and in that directory there should be a file named javac exe If this isn t the case see How to get started above Second the system s PATH variable needs to include that directory Enter SET PATH at the command prompt to see and not modify the current value of PATH If PATH does not include the directory containing javac exe then modify this system variable by going to the Control Panel and finding a dialog box with a button titled Environment Variables This should enable you to see and edit PATH sometimes Path You will need to restart your Command Prompt session and possibly your computer for the new PATH to take effect I am trying to change the size of the window and window size isn t working It sounds like you are running your game as an applet As an applet window size is ignored and the window size is determined by the browser or appletviewer If you are using Eclipse see the preceding section for information on adjusting the window size values in Eclipse s appletviewer If you are running in a browser the game s viewable area is controlled by the width and height parameters in the HTML applet tag What next Click on Gallery at the top of this page to see Ucigame programs including source running as applets ", "_id":

started.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Programming is in Java</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nComputer programming with Ucigame uses a very popular\r\nlanguage called Java.  Java is a versatile language\r\nwhich can be used to make all types of computer applications.\r\nJava has several features designed primarily for large\r\nsystems created by teams of many people.\r\nIn Ucigame we generally ignore those features.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMany good books on Java have been written, and you\r\nmay want to own one.  However, those books generally\r\ntell you much more about the language then your will\r\nneed for writing many Ucigame programs,\r\nso feel free to skip whatever\r\ndoesn't seem relevant or comprehensible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How to get started</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou need to have version 1.5.0 or later of Java, which can\r\nbe freely downloaded from Oracle, which now owns Sun Microsystems, the\r\ncompany which created Java.\r\nIt's also called the J2SE Development Kit (JDK)\r\n5 or 6 or 7.\r\nStart at <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\">\r\nOracle's download page</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou will also need a copy of\r\n<a href=\"ucigame.jar\">ucigame.jar</a>,\r\nwhich contains all the code necessary for Ucigame programming.\r\nDownload it by clicking on the link.\r\n(If you are using Internet Explorer, ucigame.jar may get renamed\r\nto ucigame.zip.  In this case, rename it back to ucigame.jar.)\r\nNow you need to put ucigame.jar in a place where it can be\r\nfound when you want to compile and run Java programs that use it.\r\nThere are two main options:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>This option may be best if you are running on your own computer.\r\nWhen Java was installed, its \"Java Runtime Environment\" or JRE was\r\nput on your computer.  In Windows, it might be in a folder called\r\nC:\\Program&nbsp;Files\\Java\\jre1.6.0.  (Note that it will have the\r\nversion number, such as 1.6.0, as part of the name.)\r\nInside that folder is a subfolder called lib, and inside of lib is\r\na subfolder called ext.  Look inside <em>that</em>, and you'll\r\nsee several .jar files.  Any .jar file in this folder is accessible\r\nto any Java program running the corresponding version of Java.\r\n(It's possible to have more than one version of Java on a computer,\r\nwhich can lead to much confusion.)  Copy ucigame.jar into this\r\nlib\\ext folder, and you're ready.\r\n<li>This option may be best if you are running on a shared computer.\r\nMove ucigame.jar into the folder where you will be writing your\r\ngame programs.  Now you need to tell Java to look in ucigame.jar\r\n(it knows to look in the lib\\ext folder without you telling it to,\r\nbut nowhere else). At the command prompt, type in\r\n<blockquote><tt>\r\n\tSET CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;ucigame.jar;\r\n</tt></blockquote>\r\nThis command adds to the \"classpath,\" that is, the list of places\r\nJava looks for class files.\r\n</p>\r\n<li><i>[probably need other options for non-Windows and for specific\r\n\t\tprogramming environments]</i>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you get an error message like \"package ucigame does not exists\"\r\nwhen trying to compile, or an exception like\r\n\"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:&nbsp;ucigame/Ucigame\" when trying\r\nto run, that's a sure sign that there's a mismatch between your\r\nCLASSPATH and the location of ucigame.jar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce you have ucigame.jar and the classpath squared away,\r\nthe steps for creating a Ucigame game application are:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Create a file called YourGame.java with the source code\r\nfor your game in it.  (This is a big step, of course.  Lot's\r\nof sample programs on this site can serve as models.)\r\n<li>At the command prompt, enter <tt>javac YourGame.java</tt>.\r\nThis <em>compiles</em> your program, which means that the\r\n.java file is transformed into one (or more) .class files.\r\nThe .class files are used to actually run the game.\r\n<li>You may get compiler errors; if so, fix them and repeat\r\nthe previous step.\r\n<li>Make sure that YourGame.class is now in your folder.\r\n<li>Run your game with <tt>java YourGame YourGame</tt>.\r\nThe name of the game has to be repeated on the command line.\r\nThis is something unique to Ucigame, and isn't true of Java\r\nprograms in general.\r\n<li>You can stop the game by pressing the Escape key.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Running Ucigame games as applications and applets</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJava programs can run as applications or as applets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nApplets are Java classes that extend java.applet.Applet.\r\nSince\r\nthe Ucigame class extends JApplet which extends Applet, your game\r\nextends Applet.  Applets usually override four methods from\r\nthe Applet class: init, start, stop, and destroy;\r\nthe Ucigame class does this for you.\r\nApplets are run inside another program, typically a web browser.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJava applications have a public static void main(String[]) method\r\nthat provides a starting point for execution.\r\nTypically applications\r\nare run on the command line with <tt>java ClassName</tt>.\r\nInside an Integrated Development Environment, an application can\r\nbe started by a button press or a menu option.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSince the Ucigame class has a public static void main method and\r\nalso extends Applet, your game that extends Ucigame be run\r\neither way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Creating and running Ucigame games with Eclipse</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEclipse (<a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\">www.eclipse.org</a>)\r\nis a powerful and extendible set of tools for editing, managing,\r\nand running Java programs (and other languages too).\r\nHere are some tips for happy co-existence between Ucigame and Eclipse:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>To start, from Eclipse's menu select File > New > Java Project.\r\nThe recommended choice under \"Project Layout\" is\r\n\"Use project folder as root for sources and class files\" although\r\neither option will work fine.\r\n\r\n<li>An important step is to make sure ucigame.jar is available.\r\nThe file can be located anywhere on your disk; a convenient location\r\nis the top level of your project.\r\nFrom Eclipse's menu select Project > Properties >\r\nJava Build Path > Libraries tab > Add External JARs... .\r\nThen navigate to the location of ucigame.jar on your computer and click Open.\r\nFinally, click OK in the Properties dialog box.\r\n\r\n<li> To activate Eclipse's nifty Code Completion pop-up boxes,\r\nyou need to provide Eclipse with the JavaDocs for Ucigame.\r\nDownload <a href=\"ucigame-javadocs.zip\">ucigame-javadocs.zip</a>\r\n(perhaps to the same location as ucigame.jar), and unzip the file.\r\nYou will see a subdirectory named UcigameJavaDocs.\r\nFrom Eclipse's menu select Project > Properties >\r\nJava Build Path > Libraries tab.\r\nExpand the tree under ucigame.jar.\r\nHighligh Javadoc location and click on Edit...\r\nUse Browse to navigate to the location of UcigameJavaDocs on your computer and click OK.\r\nFinally, click OK in the Properties dialog box.\r\n\r\n<li>When you create the primary class for your game, make sure\r\nthat ucigame.Ucigame is specified as the Superclass.\r\n\r\n<li>It is usually convenient to store image files and sound files\r\nin their own subdirectories.
