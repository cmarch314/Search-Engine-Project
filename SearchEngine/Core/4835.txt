Given a constraint network, we often wish to (i) find\r\na solution that satisfies the constraints and (ii) find the corresponding\r\nminimal network where the constraints are as explicit as possible. Both\r\ntasks are known to be NP-complete in the general case. Task (i) is usually \r\nsolved using a backtracking algorithm, and task (ii) is often solved\r\nonly approximately by enforcing various levels of local consistency. In this\r\npaper, we identify a property of binary constraints called row convexity\r\nand show its usefulness in deciding when a form of local consistency called\r\npath consistency is sufficient to guarantee that a network is both minimal\r\nand globally consistent. Globally consistent networks have the property\r\nthat a solution can be found without backtracking. We show that one can\r\ntest for the row convexity property effciently and we show, by examining\r\napplications of constraint networks discussed in the literature, that our\r\nresults are useful in practice. Thus, we identify a class of binary constraint\r\nnetworks for which we can solve both tasks (i) and (ii) efficiently. Finally,\r\nwe generalize the results for binary constraint networks to networks with\r\nnon-binary constraints.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r33-row-convex.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r33-row-convex.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 4835.0}
