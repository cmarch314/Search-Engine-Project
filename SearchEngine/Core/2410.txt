We show that, even in the uniprocessor case, no polynomial\ntime algorithm can test the feasibility of a task system within a\nconstant speedup bound, unless P =NP. This result contrasts with\nrecent results for  sporadic task systems. For two special cases,\nsynchronous task systems and systems with a constant number of\ndifferent task types, we provide the first polynomial time\nconstant-speedup feasibility tests for multiprocessor platforms.\nFurthermore, we show that the problem of testing feasibility is\ncoNP-hard for synchronous multiprocessor task systems. The complexity\nof some of these problems has been open for a long time.\nWe also propose a profit maximization variant of the feasibility\nproblem, where every task has a non-negative profit, and the goal is\nto find a subset of tasks that can be scheduled feasibly with maximum\nprofit. We give the first constant-speed, constant-approximation\nalgorithm for the case of synchronous task systems, together with\nrelated hardness results.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2410.0}
