It transforms the problem into an equivalent one,\r\nhaving one less variable. Unfortunately, there are many classes of problems for which it is infeasible, due to its\r\nexponential space and time complexity. However, by restricting variable elimination so that only low arity constraints\r\nare processed and recorded, it can be effectively combined with search, because the elimination of variables, reduces\r\nthe search tree size. In this paper we introduce VarElimSearch(S;k), a hybrid meta-algorithm that combines search\r\nand variable elimination. The parameter S names the particular search procedure and k controls the tradeoff between\r\nthe two strategies. The algorithm is space exponential in k. Regarding time, we show that its complexity is bounded\r\nby k and a structural parameter from the constraint graph. We also provide experimental evidence that the hybrid\r\nalgorithm can outperform state\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdart algorithms in binary sparse problems. Experiments cover the tasks of finding\r\none solution and the best solution (Max\ufffdCSP). Specially in the Max\ufffdCSP case, the advantage of our approach can be\r\noverwhelming.</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r89.ps\"><b>PostScript</b></a> |\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r89.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n", "id": 8638.0}
