Leung</a>, ICS,\nUC Irvine</h2>\n\nWe consider the scheduling of jobs that may be competing for\nmutually exclusive resources. We model the conflicts between jobs\nwith a \"conflict graph\", so that all concurrently running jobs must\nform an independent set in the graph. This model is natural and\ngeneral enough to have applications in a variety of settings;\nhowever, we are motivated by the following two specific\napplications: traffic intersection control and session scheduling\nin high speed local area networks with spatial reuse. Our goal is\nto bound the maximum completion time of any job in the system. It\nhas been previously shown that the best competitive ratio\nachievable by any online algorithm for the maximum completion time\non interval or bipartite graphs is Omega(<i>n</i>), where <i>n</i>\nis the number of nodes in the conflict graph. As a result, we study\nscheduling with conflicts under probabilistic assumptions about the\ninput. Each node <i>i</i> has a value <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> such\nthat a job arrives at node <i>i</i> in any given time unit with\nprobability <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>. Arrivals at different nodes and\nduring different time periods are independent. We focus on\ndistributions where the expected time to complete the jobs that\narrive in a single time unit is less than 1. Under these\nassumptions, we are able to obtain a bounded competitive ratio for\nan arbitrary conflict graph. In addition, if the conflict graph is\na perfect graph, we give an algorithm whose competitive ratio\nconverges to 1. \n\n<p>(Practice talk for a <a href= \n\"http://www.siam.org/meetings/da97/da97home.htm\">SODA '97</a> paper\nwith <a href=\"/~irani/\">Sandy Irani</a>.<br>\n<a href=\"/~vitus/pasc.ps.Z\">Conference proceedings version</a>\navailable from Vitus' website.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4139.0}
