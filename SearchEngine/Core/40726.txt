278263 Yes all packages are signed The signature for the tarball and bzip2 archive 279264 are provided by separate downloads The RPMs we provide are signed by either 28 Ethan Blanton Mark Doliner or

286271 287272 As of version 6 Gaim has been completely converted to using GTK 2 We 2962811 9 Can I run Gaim on IRIX 297282 298 It has been done before Please see http sourceforge net forum forum php 299 thread id 725839 forum id 665 at our SourceForge Forum 3 3 1 1 1 Can I run gaim on MacOSX 3 2 3 3 Yes you can but we do not provide a package for it The reason being is that 3 4 to use gaim on MacOSX you need to install an X server and gtk which we are 3 5 not prepared to support You can either compile gaim and its dependencies 3 6 yourself or you can use the fink installer available from http fink sf net 3 7 If you would like a native aqua interface or a user friendly installer we 3 8 suggest trying Adium http www adiumx com 3 9 31 1 11 How do I apply the patch something diff 311 312 Type patch p something diff from inside the gaim directory If that 283 Sure you can the amount of effort involved depends on which compiler you 284 use there is however no official support 285 286 GCC tested with 3 4 on IRIX 6 5 29 All but one necessary changes were 287 included in the official sources You will notice GnuTLS will not be included 288 by default even if the necessary includes and libraries are available to 289 add SSL support open the configure script in your favourite editor and 29 replace all instances of lnsl by lnsl lgnutls Ask no questions it 291 Just Works Mozilla NSS wasn t tested 292 293 MIPSPro CC tested with 7 4 4m on IRIX 6 5 29 Less trivial for obvious 294 ANSI tightness reasons There s an unofficial patch for 2 beta3 available 295 http jesuschrist be gaim gaim 2 beta3 irix patch which applies amongst 296 others the SSL hack described above You will need to configure WITHOUT the 297 Zephyr protocol plugin 298 299 NOTE Jabber crashed gaim when using TLS This is a bug inside GnuTLS that 3 might or might not be fixed by the time you read this 3 1 3 21 1 Can I run Gaim on HPUX 3 3 3 4 Yes you can with GCC 4 1 1 on HPUX 11 11 at least it worked fine There is 3 5 however no official support 3 6 3 7 The build scripts that are shipped with the official releases are 3 8 unfortunately incompatible with the HPUX linker fetching the svn version and 3 9 running autogen sh however gives you a healthy build dir Configure gaim 31 WITHOUT the X screensaver extension and disable the gtk and glibtests no 311 source hacks are needed 312 3131 11 Can I run Gaim on MacOSX 314 315 Yes you can but we do not provide a package for it The reason being that in 316 order to use Gaim on MacOSX you need to install an X server and GTK which 317 we are not prepared to support You can either compile Gaim and its 318 dependencies yourself or you can use the fink installer available from 319 http fink sf net If you would like a native aqua interface or a 32 user friendly installer we suggest trying Adium http www adiumx com 321 3221 12 How do I apply the patch something diff 323 324 Type patch p something diff from inside the Gaim directory If that 313325 doesn t work try patch p1 something diff 314326 315 1 12 Why is gaim crashing when I start it 3271 13 Why is Gaim crashing when I start it 316328 317329 First of all make sure you are using the most recent version of Gaim If you 322334 export GDK USE XFT in a terminal and then run Gaim from the same 323335 terminal 324 If gaim is not crashing but is just sitting there not displaying 336 If Gaim is not crashing but is just sitting there not displaying 325337 anything try turning off anything else that might be using the sound 326 device ie xmms and then starting gaim If this fixes the problem it is 327 a libao issue not a gaim issue and can be worked around by the use of 338 device ie xmms and then starting Gaim If this fixes the problem it is 339 a libao issue not a Gaim issue and can be worked around by the use of 32834 esd or arts 329341 Try disabling or deleting any 3rd party plugins especially anything 33 342 related to encryption 331343 If you use 75 or higher on win32 try deleting tcl dll 332 If you have ever installed 65 edit your gaimrc changing your auto 333 away preference from 1 to 334 335 1 13 Gaim non current version is buggy Gaim CVS is buggy Why 344 3451 14 Gaim non current version is buggy Gaim SVN is buggy Why 336346 337347 Non current versions have old bugs which may be fixed in the current 338 version that s why we make new releases CVS is frequently unusable because 348 version that s why we make new releases SVN is frequently unusable because 339349 of changes in the code Bugs are introduced during the development process 34 35 and are hopefully fixed before a release is made 341351 342 1 14 Why do you always say not to use CVS 3521 15 Why do you always say not to use SVN 343353 344354 That s a long story For starters see the previous question It is often the 345 case that Gaim CVS exhibits bad behavior due to features and bugfixes which 355 case that Gaim SVN exhibits bad behavior due to features and bugfixes which 346356 are in a transitory state or which are not yet well understood These bad 347357 behaviors range from the harmless maybe a graphical glitch in a dialog box 348358 to the irritating a particular protocol may not work to the downright 349 damaging recently a bug in CVS destroyed the user s buddy lists While 359 damaging recently a bug in SVN destroyed the user s buddy lists While 35 36 behaviors like this are acceptable to some users particularly developers 351 who are used to such things they tend to cause many Gaim CVS users to 361 who are used to such things they tend to cause many Gaim SVN users to 352362 contact Gaim developers and report the same usually egregious bug over and 353363 over using time which could be better spent fixing the bugs 354364 355 A second major point involves public resources a CVS checkout is not a 365 A second major point involves public resources an SVN checkout is not a 356366 cheap operation As many Sourceforge users are aware at various points in 357367 the recent past Sourceforge CVS has been less than pleasant to work with 358368 This is of course because Sourceforge hosts dozens and dozens of useful and 359 active projects which use CVS as a primary method of source code 369 active projects which use ed CVS as a primary method of source code 36 37 collaboration Unfortunately when too many users are poking around in that 361371 CVS just for the sake of poking around it prevents other users who are 362372 trying to do work to improve those very same projects from accomplishing 363 their tasks It is better for the community if an enterprising individual 364 wishing to fix a particular bug she has seen can get to the code and create a 365 patch even if this means that some users have to wait a few weeks for the 366 next release to see what new features it might hold 373 their tasks Naturally this could easily become true of Sourceforge s SVN 374 offering as well It is better for the community if an enterprising 375 individual wishing to fix a particular bug s he has seen can get to the code 376 and create a patch even if this means that some users have to wait a few 377 weeks for the next release to see what new features it might hold 367378 368379 The third point is not a problem which has yet come up but it is in the back 376387 server administrators may be forced to take action This is particularly 377388 likely if the buggy behavior is damaging in some way Gaim releases 378 represent code which the gaim developers feel is relatively well behaved and 389 represent code which the Gaim developers feel is relatively well behaved and 37939 stable This includes not only the interface seen by Gaim users but the 38 traffic seen by IM service providers Gaim CVS bears no such guarantees 381 382 In short there are a lot of good reasons to not use Gaim CVS if one does not 391 traffic seen by IM service providers Gaim SVN bears no such guarantees 392 393 In short there are a lot of good reasons to not use Gaim SVN if one does not 383394 wish to develop Gaim Gaim plugins or a codebase which interacts with Gaim 384 in some intimate way There are however only a few reasons to use Gaim CVS 395 in some intimate way There are however only a few reasons to use Gaim SVN 385396 outside of the above Please weigh these things carefully and decide whether 386 you wish to use Gaim CVS for a good reason which furthers the community or 397 you wish to use Gaim SVN for a good reason which furthers the community or 387398 for selfish reasons which are not entirely important 388399 4144252 2 How do I use AIM MSN Yahoo Jabber ICQ or any other protocol 415426 416 Use the Account Editor Tools Accounts or the Accounts button on the start 417 screen to add the account of the appropriate messaging service Use the 418 checkbox in the account editor to sign online 419 42 2 3 How do I change the font Gaim uses 427 Use the Account Editor Accounts Add Edit to add the account of the 428 appropriate messaging service Use the checkbox in the account editor to 429 enable the account 43 4312 3 How do I use Google Talk 432 433 Create a Jabber account as per Google s FAQ The Audio component is not 434 currently supported and will not be until work on it is finished We have no 435 time frame for that as yet 436 4372 4 How do I change the font Gaim uses The empty left padding The background 438 color 421439 42244 The font preference in Gaim is used only for the formatting of outgoing 423441 messages The display fonts used by the rest of Gaim are those specified by 424 GTK To change this font you need to edit your gtkrc 2 file If you need 425 help you can see our example gtkrc 2 http gaim sf net gtkrc 2 file 426 On Windows this file is located at C Documents and Settings username 427 themes Default gtk 2 gtkrc 442 GTK To change this font you need to edit your gtkrc 2 file If you 443 need help you can see our example gtkrc 2 http gaim sf net gtkrc 2 444 file On Windows this file is located at C Documents and Settings username 445 themes Default gtk 2 gtkrc If the file does not exist create it 428446 429447 You can also just switch to a different GTK theme You can find GTK themes 431449 art gnome org or searching on Google 43245 433 If you re having a problem with the font size used by a specific person you 434 can try turning on the Ignore Font Sizes preference in Preferences Message 435 Text 436 437 2 4 How do I make gaim use emacs like keybindings 438 439 You need to edit your gtkrc 2 to contain the keybindings line from http 44 gaim sf net gtkrc 2 441 442 2 5 How do I use smiley themes 451 Similarly the other font preferences are the defaults for outgoing messages 452 and gaim s global settings are controled by the gtk theme Additionally some 453 settings to specific parts of gaim can be set by a Gtk theme 454 4552 5 Where did my ability to use Ctrl Enter to send a message go 456 457 Gaim used to have an option in the preferences window which let you choose 458 whether to use Enter or Ctrl Enter to send a message This was less than 459 optimal for many reasons not least of which was because it only let you 46 choose between those two options It also caused large problems for people 461 who required an alternate input method people who were typing in Chinese or 462 Japanese for example On top of all this gtk provides an incredibly nice 463 mechanisms which allows keybindings to be set for things via the gtk theme 464 files Gaim decided to use this gtk interface as a method of allowing people 465 to use Ctrl Enter to send but to also allow people to use anything else they 466 felt like and to reduce the clutter in the User Interface The gtk interface 467 is unfortunately not as immediately obvious as a simple checkbox however 468 it is still simple The example gtkrc file seen http gaim sf net gtkrc 2 469 shows you how to do it among other things 47 4712 6 When I click the status selector I see blank space and have to scroll 472 What can I do about this 473 474 Edit your gtkrc 2 to contain the appropriate lines from http 475 gaim sf net gtkrc 2 Search for appears as list 476 4772 7 The status selector has extra padding in it How can I make it smaller 478 479 Edit your gtkrc 2 to contain the appropriate lines from http 48 gaim sf net gtkrc 2 Search for xthickness There are two examples Start 481 by trying the first one If that makes the status selector look worse then 482 try the second one 483 4842 8 How do I make gaim use emacs like keybindings or assign a custom hotkey 485 486 You need to edit your gtkrc 2 to contain the appropriate lines from 487 http gaim sf net gtkrc 2 If you are using gtk can change accels 1 488 then you hover over the menu item then press your desired key stroke 489 49 2 9 How do I make Escape close the conversation window 491 492 Sadly you can t use the hover and press technique just described for this 493 because Escape closes the menu You have to hand edit gaim accels Close 494 Gaim and open gaim accels in your favorite text editor Find 495 gtk accel path main Conversation Close something remove the 496 semi colon which is the comment character from the start of the line if it 497 is there and replace whatever is between the second pair of quote marks with 498 Escape Save and close and restart Gaim 499 5 2 1 How do I use smiley themes 4435 1 4445 2 To select a theme open Gaim s preferences to the Smiley Themes page and 4455 3 click on whichever theme you want to use To install a theme simply drag it 4465 4 into the theme selector You can find themes on the Gaim Smiley Themes http 447 gaim sf net themes php page 5 5 sourceforge net tracker atid 746976 group id 235 func browse tracker 4485 6 4495 7 You can also install themes manually by uncompressing them to their own 45 5 8 directory in gaim smileys 4515 9 452 2 6 Why are the status icons so big 51 2 11 Why are the status icons so big 453511 454512 We believe that by adding a second line of text to each buddy list entry 455513 we re able to show more information about each buddy on the buddy list The 456 Big List as we call it shows status text idle time and warning level 457 concisely and attractively It shows more than one status emblem for each 458 buddy indicating at the same time a mobile user who is away Most 459 importantly it puts the buddy icon in the list making it far easier to 46 locate buddies within a large list where names are harder to pick out than 461 images Due to the increased usability of this interface we have made it the 462 default 514 Big List as we call it shows status text and idle time concisely and 515 attractively It shows more than one status emblem for each buddy 516 indicating at the same time a mobile user who is away Most importantly it 517 puts the buddy icon in the list making it far easier to locate buddies 518 within a large list where names are harder to pick out than images Due to 519 the increased usability of this interface we have made it the default 46352 464521 We are aware that some people feel more comfortable using an interface more 465522 similar to IM clients they may have used in the past The Big List can be 466 disabled by un checking Show buddy icons in the Buddy List preferences 467 468 2 7 Why do the emblems move around the status icon 523 disabled by un checking Show buddy details in the Buddies menu 524 5252 12 Why do the emblems move around the status icon 469526 47 527 The four corners of the icon have different precedence The lower right is 477534 emblem would fit 478535 479 2 8 How do I get sound to work correctly 48 481 Gaim uses libao to play sounds Playing sounds directly through esound or 5362 13 How do I get sound to work correctly 537 538 Gaim uses gstreamer to play sounds Playing sounds directly through esound or 482539 arts is no longer supported 48354 484 Libao is a cross platform library that allows programs to output PCM audio 485 data to the native audio devices on a wide variety of platforms It currently 486 supports OSS Open Sound System ESD ESounD ALSA Advanced Linux Sound 487 Architecture Sun audio system used in Solaris OpenBSD and NetBSD aRts 488 Analog Realtime Synthesizer 489 49 To compile Gaim with support for libao you need libao devel and 491 audiofile devel To use libao you need libao and audiofile If you do not 492 wish to install these packages you can also just change your sound playing 493 method in preferences to Command and use esdplay s or artsplay s 494 495 2 9 How do I make Gaim use ALSA or OSS for playing sounds What does the 496 Automatic option do 497 498 If you choose Automatic ESD or Arts Gaim uses libao to play sounds 499 Choosing ESD or Arts forces libao to play sounds using that method while 5 choosing Automatic lets it decide for itself 5 1 5 2 If you choose Automatic you can create a file either etc libao conf or 5 3 libao and put one of the following lines in it 5 4 5 5 default driver alsa 5 6 5 7 default driver oss 5 8 5 9 Other drivers like alsa 9 arts esd irix macosx and sun might also be 51 supported depending on your platform and how libao was compiled See also 511 man 5 libao conf 512 513 2 1 Why does Gaim use the same WM CLASS for every window It makes it 541 To compile Gaim with support for gstreamer you need libgstreamer 1 dev and 542 its dependencies If you do not wish to install these packages you can also 543 just change your sound playing method in preferences to Command and use 544 esdplay s or artsplay s 545 5462 14 How do I make Gaim use ALSA or OSS for playing sounds What does the 547 Automatic option do 548 549 The Automatic option lets gstreamer pick how the sounds are played You can 55 use the gstreamer properties tool to control this 551 5522 15 Why does Gaim use the same WM CLASS for every window It makes it 514553 impossible to control window size and placement for the buddy list 515554 separately from the conversations 522561 then it should provide a WM WINDOW ROLE property 523562 524 GTK sets these WM CLASS values for us so that they are unique for Gaim 563 Gtk sets these WM CLASS values for us so that they are unique for Gaim 525564 instances and the documentation for the gtk window set wmclass function says 526565 explicitly not to use it for anything else Gaim uses the WM WINDOW ROLE hint 529568 WM WINDOW ROLE hint per the ICCCM 53 569 531 2 11 I blocked someone accidentally how can I unblock them 57 2 16 I blocked someone accidentally how can I unblock them 532571 533572 See the Privacy option under the Tools menu of the Buddy List 534573 535 2 12 What is a Buddy Pounce 5742 17 What is a Buddy Pounce 536575 537576 Gaim introduced buddy pounces a few releases before AOL came out with Buddy 546585 your buddy list who you have pounced signs on 547586 548 2 13 Where does gaim store its logs 549 55 On unix they are in gaim logs on win32 they are in the drive Documents 551 and Settings user Application Data gaim logs directory In either case new 552 logs new as of 73 are in subdirectories that correspond to protocol 553 yourscreenname theirscreenname 554 555 2 14 How can I see my own status with Gaim 556 557 Currently the only supported method to see your own status is to add yourself 558 to your buddy list This works with Aim ICQ Y M IRC and some of the 559 others and is mimiced by gaim for MSN and Jabber 56 561 2 15 Can I use Gaim for e mail blogging an RSS feed or something else that 5872 18 Where does gaim store its logs 588 589 On unix they are in gaim logs on win32 they are in the C Documents and 59 Settings user Application Data gaim logs directory NOTE Application Data 591 is a hidden directory In either case new logs new as of 73 are in 592 subdirectories that correspond to protocol yourscreenname theirscreenname 593 5942 19 Can I use Gaim for e mail blogging an RSS feed or something else that 562595 isn t IM related 563596 5766 93 1 Does Gaim support file transfer 57761 578 Somewhat yeah As of 79 the following is supported 579 58 Sending and receiving files on AIM although it might be a bit buggy 611 Somewhat yeah As of 1 2 1 The following is supported 612 613 Sending and receiving files on AIM ICQ although it might be a bit buggy 581614 Sending and receiving files on IRC 582615 Sending and receiving files on Jabber 583616 Sending and receiving files on MSN 584617 Sending and receiving files on SILC 585 Sending and receiving files on Yahoo sending is limited to 1Mb 618 Sending and receiving files on Yahoo when not using an HTTP proxy 619 sending is limited to an unknown file size 58662 587621 Most of the protocols themselves support file transfer but Gaim has not been 588622 written to support it yet If you would like file transfer to work better or 589 be more complete get CVS and submit a patch using the generic file transfer 623 be more complete get SVN and submit a patch using the generic file transfer 59 624 API 591625 592 3 2 Is there a Gaim tray icon or docklet or gnome applet or panel icon or 593 something 594 595 Yeah Gaim supports what is called a system tray icon that conforms to the 596 standards at www freedesktop org This tray icon is supported by Windows KDE 597 3 1 Gnome 2 2 and Red Hat Gnome 2 All you have to do is load the System 598 Tray Icon plugin by going to Preferences and then Plugins 599 6 If you re using Gnome you need to make sure that your panel has a 6 1 Notification Area on it To add one right click on the panel select Add To 6 2 Panel Utility Notification Area Gaim will insert the tray icon in any 6 3 System Tray implementation that conforms to these standards so feel free to 6 4 write one for your window manager of choice 6 5 6 6 Due to a flaw in these specs KDE users may experience trouble with the 6 7 background color of the docklet There is unfortunately nothing we can do 6 8 about this 6263 2 Can I turn the tray icon off 627 628 Sorry no The tray icon will load if you have a Notification Area 6 9629 61 63 3 3 What do those colors in the conversation tab mean 617637 signed off 618638 619 3 4 Will Gaim save my buddy list to the server 62 621 Yes Gaim saves your buddy list to the server for AIM ICQ Jabber MSN 622 Novell and Yahoo 623 624 3 5 Can I import or export my buddy list 625 626 Sorry no Old versions of Gaim supported this but new versions do not All 627 the code for saving and loading buddy lists was rewritten and support for 628 importing and exporting buddy lists was never re added However with all 629 major protocols storing their buddy lists on the server this feature is less 63 useful today than in the past 631 632 3 6 Does Gaim support animated smileys 633 634 Yes as of version 7 Gaim supports animated smileys 635 636 3 7 Can I make Gaim group screen names by the person that owns them You know 6393 4 Can I import or export my buddy list 64 641 The plugin pack hosted at http guifications sourceforge net PluginPack has 642 a plugin to do this 643 6443 5 Does Gaim support animated smileys 645 646 Yes but there is a bug which can cause animation to be lost if gaim has to 647 resize the image 648 6493 6 Can I make Gaim group screen names by the person that owns them You know 63765 like Trillian s Meta Contacts 638651 646659 Contacts in order to be able to edit an existing Contact 64766 648 3 8 How do I get the old logging back 649 65 The old logging was removed because it was deficient in many ways There is 651 no way in Gaim itself to revert to the old logging but the new logging is so 652 good you could implement something similar to the old logging as a plugin 653 654 3 9 How can I convert my old logs to the new format 655 656 It s not possible to perfectly convert from the old format to the new format 657 because the old format is missing some information necessary to do that eg 658 which account the messages were sent from 659 66 It shouldn t be too difficult to do a rough conversion using a small script 661 or using the old logger functions in gaim itself 662 663 Peter Johnson has written a python script to do just this it is available on 664 his website at the bottom 665 666 667 4 ICQ Protocol 668 669 67 4 1 How do I use ICQ 671 672 ICQ support is part of the OSCAR protocol labeled AIM ICQ in Gaim To use 673 it simply put your account number in the Screen Name box and your password 674 in the Password box Leave the server settings set to the default 675 login oscar aol com and port 519 676 677 4 2 Can I send SMS messages 678 679 Kind of See our answer to this for the AIM ICQ Protocol 68 681 682 5 TOC Protocol 683 684 685 5 1 What is the TOC protocol 686 687 It s an AIM protocol used by Quick Buddy and AIM Express It s recommended 688 that you don t use it You should use Gaim s OSCAR AIM ICQ protocol 689 instead We keep TOC around in case OSCAR ever stops working However we are 69 not actively supporting this code and no longer distribute it in binaries 691 692 693 6 AIM ICQ OSCAR Protocol 694 695 696 6 1 Can I set my profile 697 698 Yes you can Go to Tools Account Actions 699 7 6 2 Can I set a buddy icon 7 1 7 2 Yes Go to the Account Editor Tools Accounts from the buddy list and 7 3 click to Modify the AIM ICQ account you wish to have an icon Enter the 7 4 full path to the image you wish to use in the box labeled Buddy Icon File 7 5 The file must be below 4KB It can have any dimensions and can be in any 7 6 format However if you wish Windows users to see it it must be in a format 7 7 Windows understands such as bmp gif and jpg 7 8 7 9 6 3 Some of my buddies are not showing up as online why is that 71 711 AOL has set a limit for the maximum number of people you can have in your 712 buddy list This number is currently 2 If you don t think you are anywhere 713 near that limit it is possible that your server stored buddy list is 714 corrupt 715 716 If you think this might be the case you can try signing on with an official 717 AIM program from AOL This will usually correct any problems with the list 718 719 6 4 Can I use AIM URI s such as aim goim screenname robflynn 72 721 Yes with Gaim 6 and higher but it can be difficult to set up You need 722 to pass the entire URI to the gaim remote program included with gaim To do 723 this with Gnome 2 run gnome file types properties or File Types and 724 Programs from the preferences menu Add a service with protocol aim and 725 set the program to gaim remote uri s This will make AIM URIs work in 726 Galeon 2 Also not all types of AIM URI s are supported The ones that are 727 supported are goim addbuddy and gochat 728 729 You ll need the Remote Control plugin loaded for this to work 73 731 If you use wingaim this will not work as gaim remote has not yet been ported 732 over 733 734 6 5 I just changed my buddy icon and I can t see the new one 6613 7 What happened to my timestamps Can I change them 662 663 As of 2 timestamps follow the system locale This is a significant 664 difference from previous versions of gaim and though it was requested more 665 than once we know it will prove to be a controversial decision Fortunately 666 for all of you out there we also provide plugins to change it 667 668 As of 2 there are two plugins that relate to timestamps One the 669 Timestamp plugin has existed for some time It allows you to have iChat 67 style timestamps though implemented to behave slightly differently The 671 other plugin is new The Message Timestamp Formats plugin allows you to 672 manipulate your timestamps in a couple different ways Notably you can 673 restore the 1 x timestamp format and or cause all timestamps to have dates 674 in them 675 6763 8 How does Gaim decide which saved statuses to show in the status selector 677 678 Gaim shows six popular saved statuses in the status selector These are 679 your six most recently used statuses offset by a weight Gaim sorts all your 68 saved statuses by the timestamp when they were last used And then for each 681 time you ve used a status the timestamp is increased by one day 682 683 If you are upgrading from 1 x or lower gaim is unable to determine which are 684 the most popular states as these older releases did not save that 685 information As a result the initial contents of the menu will be somewhat 686 random It will settle over the first few uses of distinct states into the 687 behavior described above 688 6893 9 Why are no states listed when I go to set a state for Auto Away 69 691 Gaim can only use saved states for this feature You need to create and save 692 a named state first 693 694 695 4 AIM ICQ OSCAR Protocol 696 697 6984 1 Can I set my profile 699 7 In AIM yes you can Go to Accounts account name Set your ICQ profile is 7 1 not supported yet 7 2 7 34 2 Can I set a buddy icon 7 4 7 5 Yes Go to the Account Menu and click to Modify the AIM ICQ account you 7 6 wish to have an icon Enter the full path to the image you wish to use in the 7 7 box labeled Buddy Icon File The file must be smaller than 4KB It can have 7 8 any dimensions and can be in any format However if you wish Windows users 7 9 to see it it must be in a format Windows understands such as bmp gif 71 and jpg 711 7124 3 I just changed my buddy icon and I can t see the new one 735713 736714 First try IMing yourself a few times Buddy icons are checked when you IM 74272 the protocol supports it try restarting Gaim 743721 744 6 6 Does Gaim support DirectIM and IM Image 7224 4 Some of my buddies are not showing up as online why is that 723 724 AOL has set a limit for the maximum number of people you can have in your 725 buddy list This number is currently 5 for AIM if you don t think you are 726 anywhere near that limit it is possible that your server stored buddy list 727 is corrupt 728 729 If you think this might be the case you can try signing on with an official 73 AIM program from AOL This will usually correct any problems with the list 731 7324 5 Can I use AIM URI s such as aim goim screenname robflynn 733 734 Yes you need to register gaim url handler in your browser This requires 735 that Gaim be built with dbus support 736 7374 6 Does Gaim support DirectIM and IM Image 745738 746739 Yeah kind of This tends to be one of the buggier areas of Gaim If it s not 74774 working for you make sure that at least one person is not behind a firewall 748741 749 6 7 Can I send SMS messages 7424 7 Can I send SMS messages 75 743 751744 Yep just send an IM to the person s phone number For example if the phone 752 number is 919 555 1234 you would IM the screen name 19195551234 We think 753 this should work for countries with a country code of 1 the United States 754 and Canada 745 number is 919 555 1234 you would message 19195551234 We think this should 746 work for countries with a country code of 1 the United States and Canada 755747 756748 Sending SMS messages using the ICQ method is not yet supported 757749 758 6 8 Can I add SMS numbers to my buddy list 759 76 Not currently This functionality has been broken since around September 761 2 3 There is no ETA for when it will be fixed 762 763 6 9 I heard AOL is combining ICQ and AIM does that mean I can send a message 764 from an AIM account to an ICQ account and vice versa 765 766 Yes AOL is slowly letting the two messaging networks interoperate with each 767 other Messaging between the two protocols works as long as the receiver of 768 the message supports it Gaim 6 supports sending and receiving messages 769 between AIM and ICQ but the person receiving the message must support this 77 Gaim of course supports this for both ICQ and AIM accounts Windows AIM 771 version 5 2 3139 supports receiving messages from ICQ users It is unknown if 772 earlier versions of Windows AIM support this Windows ICQ build 38 does not 773 support receiving messages from AIM users Windows ICQ Lite builds 115 and 774 later support receiving messages from AIM users and sending messages to AIM 775 users MacAIM versions 4 6 beta build 1 1131 and newer support sending and 776 receiving messages to and from ICQ users 777 778 The same clients that support receiving messages from the alternate messaging 779 network will also show up in buddy lists of people using the alternate 78 network This means that if you can message an ICQ user from an AIM account 781 then the ICQ user will also show up in your AIM buddy list So an AIM user 782 using Windows AIM version 5 2 3139 will show up in an ICQ buddy list 783 784 6 1 Why can t I connect via either Oscar or TOC 785 786 If you are using Linux your kernel may be using a network option called 787 ECN It seems that the AOL servers are currently dropping packets marked as 788 ECN capable In order to turn this off run the command 789 79 echo proc sys net ipv4 tcp ecn 791 792 as root or if your distribution supports it put the line 793 794 net ipv4 tcp ecn 795 796 in the file etc sysctl conf 797 798 6 11 English is not my native language and some of my friends have trouble 799 seeing my IMs I have trouble seeing my friends IMs How do I use a 8 native language character set with ICQ 8 1 8 2 Gaim 82 and higher allow you to specify a character encoding to use when 8 3 conversing with ICQ users Use the account editor to set this encoding 8 4 8 5 6 12 Can I set myself invisible 8 6 8 7 Yes Go to Tools Away account Invisible 8 8 8 9 81 7 IRC Protocol 811 812 813 7 1 How do I join a channel with the IRC plugin 814 815 First

is the sender you can also 818 use join to connect to a new channel 819 82 7 2 Is there a way to make Gaim automatically identify me and or join IRC 75 4 8 Can I add SMS numbers to my buddy list 751 752 Yes You should be able to add phone numbers to your buddy list using the 753 same format as above 754 755 756 5 IRC Protocol 757 758 7595 1 How do I join a channel with the IRC plugin 76 761 Create an IRC account and then sign on After you have signed on you can use 762 Buddies Join A Chat on the buddy list to join a channel In any window 763 either a conversation or a chat in which your IRC user is the sender you 764 can also use join to connect to a new channel 765 7665 2 Is there a way to make Gaim automatically identify me and or join IRC 821767 chats on login 822768 827773 it and tell Gaim to auto join it 828774 829 7 3 Is it possible to change the user name that appears in username hostname 83 831 Yes Go to Tools Accounts Select your IRC account and click Modify Expand 832

normally would THIS IS A 862 REQUIRED STEP 863 4 Check the Register with server check box 864 5 Click OK 865 866 Note You are strongly recommended to check the Remember password check box 867 as well as Gaim presently does no password verification So if you don t 868 type in what you thought you did you re hosed 869 87 8 4 How do I use invisibility 871 872 Jabber invisibility support is available in Gaim version 6 and later 873 874 There are two ways to use Jabber invisibility on a per buddy and on a 875 per server basis 876 877 To use per buddy invisibility right click on the buddy on the Online buddy 878 list and select Temporarily Hide From You will appear to that buddy to be 879 off line To make yourself seen by that buddy again right click on the buddy 88 and select Un hide From Note that the menu changes based on whether you re 881 currently invisible to that buddy or not 882 883 The Temporarily part is a dead give away Your invisibility to that 884 buddy will last only until the next time you log on or until you set 885 server invisibility discussed next on and off 886 887 To use per server invisibility click Tools Away select the Jabber 888 server login for the

a 96 Chat You can also create a chat room this way although we don t support 961 setting the hidden or invite only type settings 962 963 To get a non US room list you ll need to change the Chat Room List Url in 964 the account editor under Show more options By default this field contains 965 http insider msg yahoo com ycontent You can add a country code prefix 966 to the url to fetch the list for another country For example for the German 967 list you would use http de insider msg yahoo com ycontent 968 969 This has recently stopped working we are investigating alternatives 97 971 The list of known country codes for this url is 8467 3 Can I get a list of Yahoo Chat rooms What about localized lists 847 848 Tools Room List will let you list available Yahoo Chat rooms Yahoo has 849 currently disabled user created rooms The option to create rooms still 85 exists in Gaim but is non functional unless Yahoo re enables user created 851 rooms 852 853 Please note that defaults to US localized

list and your deny list There are two ways to fix this the correct way and 1 25 the quick way The correct way is to go to Tools Privacy and manually scan 1 26 the list and remove the duplicate entries The quick way is to remove the 1 27 blist xml file from the gaim directory Be aware that this contains your 1 28 buddy list for all accounts and also stores the Contact grouping of 1 29 Buddies 1 3 1

51 You did not compile with SSL support or the SSL plugin failed to load As of 1 52 protocol version 9 the MSN protocol requires the use of SSL which Gaim 1 53 provides by either GnuTLS or the combination of NSS and NSPR from the Mozilla 1 54 project Install one or both of these and recompile Gaim and see the next 1 55 question 1 56 1 57 1 7 The MSN plugin won t load but I have Mozilla NSS

words option 1254 1255 Gaim currently only supports spell checking in your locale language This is 1256 because gtkspell 2 does not offer a good way for us to know which 1257 dictionaries are available or to switch between them This functionality has 1258 long been promised for gtkspell version 3 which has been delayed somewhat 1259 indefinitely See gtkspell sf net 126 126115 9 Can I make Gaim transparent translucent 1262 1263 You can make Gaim translucent in most versions of Windows using the 1264 Transparency plugin It is not possible to make Gaim translucent in Linux 1265 and other platforms that use X11 1266 1267 X org provides a COMPOSITE extension that allows applications to have true 1268 translucency but it is X org specific and it requires support at the GTK 1269 level if it is to be per widget We do not wish to support this form of 127 translucency until it is supported by GTK We also do not wish to implement 1271 the psuedo translucency offered by other programs by copying a section of 1272 your background image tinting it and plastering it onto a Gaim window 1273 127415 1 Can I skin Gaim 1275 1276 The UI can be customized using GTK themes Read http gaim
