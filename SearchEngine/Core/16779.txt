This presentation \nwill map the current FDA regulations for medical device software to the\nCMM. Three questions will be addressed: (1) Would a Level 3 company be \ncompliant with the FDA regulations? (2) At what CMM level(s) would an \norganization be rated if its products were compliant with the FDA \nregulations? (3) What might the CMM community leverage from the FDA \napproach?\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\n<p>\nJean Tyson has 18 years of experience in software development \nfor medical instruments at Beckman Coulter, Inc.
