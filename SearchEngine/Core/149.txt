games in a week By venita April 21st 2 11 April 13th 2 11 7 41 am 8 Comments posted by Ian Hamilton Share157 After a week spent building a computer game from scratch Justin Britch is sitting behind a laptop Monday night just five hours from an 11 p m deadline We couldn t get our levels to work for a very long time Britch tells Reza Ghassemi president of UC Irvine s Video Game Development Club For how long asks Ghassemi Are they working now Britch asks his teammates No half the levels still don t work Britch 19 and a resident of Mission Viejo is participating in his second Game Jam a week long marathon competition put on by the university s gaming club pitting teams of computer science art and informatics majors working around the clock against one another to build computer games Though the games are simple mostly two dimensional with flat maps and relatively simple multicolored animated characters the third Game Jam competition held by the club is an opportunity for budding artists game designers and programmers to add a finished product to their portfolio And they do it in just a week while experiencing what it s like to work and collaborate on a project With video game giant Blizzard Entertainment nearby UC Irvine is seeing an increase in the prominence of video game development The school introduced a new major computer game science in fall 2 1 but too late to be promoted to prospective students Britch is among around 4 students already accepted to the university who switched majors once he found out it was offered Now the degree program is being actively marketed and more than 4 applications were received for the fall 2 11 quarter according to Walt Scacchi director of research at the university s Computer Games and Virtual Worlds Center A similar major computer game design was introduced at UC Santa Cruz in 2 6 and the number of students majoring in the degree now outnumber those majoring in general computer science When we talked to undergraduate computer science majors already here in the university and asked them what they want to do when they graduate the vast majority 7 8 or 9 percent have said they d really like to get a job in the game industry said Scacchi That s without there being a Computer Game Science major The Video Game Development Club held three of these Game Jams the first only having two teams the second having four and the third with five teams Meetings for the club have gone from occupying a corner of a computer lab with a little more than a dozen people to filling a room with 3 to 4 people Some teams in the Game Jam competition work remotely using instant messaging and email to coordinate the project while others spend time a lot of time working together at the university Ryan Sharpe a 2 8 UCI alumnus was the producer for his team and spent around 11 hours with them through the course of the week much of it in a Donald Bren Hall computer lab stricken with poor ventilation as well as a bevy of heat producing laptops computers and warm bodies coding for a week He described part of his job as being about supplying food with frequent trips to nearby In N Out and avoiding the clich of Mountain Dew and pizza as well as blankets and pillows when team members got tired Four fans and propping the doors open help alleviate the heat as recycle bins filled up with empty soda cans Benches outside the lab doubled as beds for overnight work on weekends You have to put the hours in Games don t just happen when you have an idea said Sharpe A freshman Britch did level design as part of Sharpe s team during the last Game Jam on a game that ultimately won the competition He had planned to come to the university as a physics major until he realized he actually hated the subject as a senior in high school He found out UCI offered the computer game science major and picked it up as a placeholder thinking he d switch to engineering Then I realized this is what I want to do he said With the 11 p m deadline approaching Britch s team finally got the levels working at 1 3 p m one of the last things they did I walked around to each individual person and asked them Is this in the game Is this in the game And just ran down the checklist to make sure we didn t forget anything he said They did forget something Around 1 45 p m they realized the project left out sound effects three hours of Britch s work left on the cutting room floor Instead of missing the deadline they submitted as is with 1 minutes to spare There s only so much you can do said Britch Another team besieged by technical problems didn t finish in time and was disqualified Apart from the experience the grand prize is a poster on the wall of the gaming lab in Donald Bren Hall naming them as winners I plan on doing this every time they offer it said Britch You can try out the games for yourself though I can t guarantee how well any of these will work and they should only work on a PC Rainbow Dice Games
