In\naddition, it has altogether 600 edges and 280 vertices. \nThus its Euler characteristic \\chi = F - E + V  equals  -20. \nConsequently, its genus g = (1/2)(2-\\chi)  equals 11. \nThis means that it is topologically equivalent to a doughnut with\naltogether 11 holes (or, if you like it more, to a sphere endowed with\n11 [torus-like] handlebodies). \nWell, and all this is made of congruent rhombi... (thus it is\nmonohedral). Nice job! \n  \nI am afraid that facing the exercise: \"Find a monohedral (!) non-convex\npolyhedron with genus 11\" \nwould be somewhat frustrating experience to quite a number of people\n(including geometers). \n  \nCongratulations! \n  \nGG \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: unico \nTo: Gabor Gevay \nSent: Friday, September 19, 2003 4:23 AM \nSubject: prGR \n\n\nHell&oacute; G&aacute;bor, \n\nLet me show you some of my models, \nS&aacute;ndor\n</pre>\n<p align=center><img src=\"unico.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\"\nalt=\"rhombic triacosiohedron\"></p>\n", "id": 3695.0}
