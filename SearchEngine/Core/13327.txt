The time to construct this graph\nis near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to\napproximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the\nsame time bound.\n<p>\n<li><b>Planar induced subgraphs of sparse graphs</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/\">G.
