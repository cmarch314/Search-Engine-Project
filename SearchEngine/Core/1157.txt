{"text": "Informatics 117 Project in Software System Design Winter Quarter 2 9 Architecture and Module Specifications Due Date February 12 2 9 Overview Develop a design that fully satisfies the requirements for your application This deliverable consists of two elements a design specification consisting of an architecture and module specifications and an integration test plan Your document must specify the correspondence between the requirements elements and your design You may show this correspondence any way you feel is appropriate e g make notations throughout your document or using a table that cross references paragraph numbers Developing the software design will undoubtedly reveal inadequacies in previous documents Please note these problems and what was done to resolve them Don t forget to include your meeting minutes and performance appraisals with your document refer to the syllabus for the complete check list of what has to be turned in As before make sure that you post your design documents and your meeting minutes to your team web page Deliverable Objectives Quality Keep in mind that key objectives of a design document include Develop a coherent representation of software that will satisfy the requirements Identify inadequacies in requirements Decompose the system into sub systems that provide related sets of services Establish a framework for sub system control and communication Specify modules that can be assigned as coding responsibilities Document design decisions and rationale Provide a reference tool readable by developers testers and maintainers Provide a basis for integration and testing In addition keep in mind that a design document should exhibit the following qualities Complete everything that is essential is described Unambiguous expressed in a well defined notation Consistent no mismatched interfaces Modifiable this document will change just like all the others Confirmable testable you can tell when you ve met the design Document Contents Introduction Expand your previous introduction to discuss your specific approaches to the design of the system and the organization of this document This description is essentially just an updated version of the introduction you included in your previous deliverable Understanding Expand the understanding section of your previous document Include brief descriptions of actions you took to understand each technology studied during this phase If you make changes to this section add text describing why the change was necessary and why it more accurately reflects your new understanding This section need not be different if your understanding hasn t changed Project Plan This will be an iterative expansion of your previous submission Update your project plan to show what you have accomplished so far Reassess the project risks as necessary Expand your task network or work breakdown structure to include the effort expended to complete this task as necessary Based on the work you have done revise your estimates on how much your team can accomplish and deliver If you make changes add text describing why the change was necessary or why it will improve the ability of your team to accomplish the work you have proposed Design Specification Architecture Overview Architectural Style What style of architecture did you adopt Provide a reference to a defining document System Architecture Overview This is the place for your one great diagram that shows how your system is built You might want to use more than one diagram to show e g some different abstractions of the design such as a data flow view a layers of abstraction view an object view or an OS process view multiple diagrams are fine Subsystem Narrative What each subsystem means Major limitations on the current design if any Modules Objects Specification List of Modules Objects within your system For each module object provide a Module Specification Name Definition Purpose what it is does Narrative Comment how it works What are the interfaces or APIs Visibility Data What state does it keep if any Access Who has access to the module object data Requires What modules does this module depend upon Constraints what constraints are there for this object module e g must start first must be registered with must anything else necessary to fully describe the module Diagrams you could consider using in providing this specification UML class diagrams event sequence trace charts state transition diagrams package diagrams Integration Test Plan A test plan capable of demonstrating that the design meets the requirements Test cases should cover each module object interaction specified The test cases can be grouped with the design entity to which they apply otherwise a cross reference listing of some sort should be provided For each test Test ID Purpose of Test Item s being tested Input specification Output specification Expected Results or Test Oracle Mechanism Test environmental needs or special test procedures Initial Demonstration Plan What and how will you demonstrate Tracking and Control Mechanisms Configuration Management how will your modules objects be managed SVN CVS file structure sub directories Makefiles etc where is your persistent data going to live Requirements Cross Reference what modules objects satisfy what requirements a table mapping requirement to module object Modifications to Prior Documents Requirements If any requirements changed make them explicit Highlight why the requirement was changed added deleted and by whom customer developer etc If your requirements have not changed then so state Glossary Define any irregular terms used in the specifications above This portion of the document may be written as an extension to the glossary submitted with the requirements or may be a separate document that only defines terms local to the design activity Additional Documentation This section is reserved for any additional documentation developed during this phase of the project Specifically if during the course of developing the architecture your understanding of the various technologies involved in the project changed or you discovered items that were not documented but which are important include that information here Also list here the major background sources that you used during this phase or any that you plan to use during the remainder of the project This includes references to similar systems and or procedures Design Presentations See the syllabus for dates Each team should prepare a 15 minute presentation Your presentation should include the following Some context for your project very brief Current state of your project plan and comparison to the previous version of the plan Highlights of your design including an overview of your architecture this should comprise the bulk of your presentation the one great diagram one or more key module object specifications As needed Modifications to your requirements that arose as a result of your design process Overview of your integration test plan ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/classes/117/design.html", "title": "deliverable 3: design",
