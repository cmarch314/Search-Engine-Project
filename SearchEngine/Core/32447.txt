I was wondering if you\r\nmight be interested in exploring a possible LANGSAM connection. I maintain a\r\nwebsite at www.langsam.com that outlines what I know from the definitive\r\nbranches.\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n=======================================================\r\nEmail posted from Family Tree of the Jewish People\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: bachrach@mindspring.com \r\nTo: \"Moishe Miller\" <moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Re: Family Tree of the Jewish People: Gertrude LANGSAM \r\nDate: Sun, 21 Jan 2001 21:40:26 -0600 \r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Langsam,\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for writing. All I know about the Langsams is that Gertrude Langsam\r\nmarried my mother's paternal uncle, Alvin Udell. Also, that Gertie had a\r\nbrother named Martin, who was a surgeon trained at NYU. Martin's wife was\r\nnamed Bea. They lived in Hallandale Florida at the end of their lives.\r\nGertie and Martin died within a couple of weeks of one another. This was\r\napproximately 1985 (I was in medical school from 83-87 and Gertie died\r\nduring this time).  I do know that Alvin and Gertie were cremated and their\r\nashes were buried in the floor of the Udell family mausoleum in Acacia\r\nCemetery, Ozone Park (Queens), NY. Does this fit with anything you know?\r\n\r\n\r\nA NY geneologist by the name of Florence Marmor once exchanged some e mails\r\nwith me regarding Acacia Cemeterty in Queens, NY. She told me she was\r\nrelated to some Langsam's, if that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know,\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Wishes,\r\n\r\n\r\nAlan F. Bachrach, M.D.\r\n  \r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 6/22/04</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "id": 32447.0}
