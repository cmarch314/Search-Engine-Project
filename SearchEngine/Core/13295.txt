an input such that no matter which state the DFA starts in it ends up after the input in a known state These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion planning problems in fact the conference version of this paper used the title Reset sequences for finite automata with application to design of parts orienters and also in coding theory where they arise in the design of self synchronizing codes This paper considers DFAs in which the transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states and shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly It also
