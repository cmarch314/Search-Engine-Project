You may use any word processor or HTML authoring software\nthat can generate HTML documents.  \n\n<p>\nMy personal preference is simply to write the HTML using a text\neditor.  For example, here is an \n<a href=\"template/index.html\">example project writeup</a> that you \nmay use as a template.\n\n<p>\nIf you are just learning HTML, first print out the HTML source\nfor the template.  To do this, navigate to it using your browser,\nand either ask the browser to \"View Source\" or save the page to\nyour computer and open it in a text editor.  The file is called\n\"index.html\", and should begin as follows:\n\n<blockquote><pre>\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body style=\"width:750px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\nCS342 Computational Photography / Fall 2007 / Prof. Martin&lt;br&gt;\nProject Name&lt;br&gt;\n.\n.\n.\n</pre></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYou'll see that HTML \"code\" is mostly normal text, with some\nformatting commands in angle brackets.  These formatting commands\nare called <em>tags</em>.  For example,\nthe text for the page is entirely inside the \n\"<tt>&lt;body>...&lt/body></tt>\"\ntags.  \n\n<h4>Formatting Text</h4>\n\n<p>\nBegin every new paragraph with \n\"<tt>&lt;p></tt>\".  If you need to force a line break, use\n\"<tt>&lt;br></tt>\".\n\n<p>\nIn the template, you'll see that the header text for the page is within the\n\"<tt>&lt;h3>...&lt/h3></tt>\" tags.  You can use any of the\nheader tags (h1,h2,...h6) to define section headers of various sizes.\n\n<p>\nTo create an automatically numbered ordered list of items, use the\n\"<tt>&lt;ol>...&lt/ol></tt>\" tags,\nand begin each list item with a \n\"<tt>&lt;li></tt>\" tag.  You can control the type of numbers used\nwith a parameter to the ordered list tag, e.g. \n\"<tt>&lt;ol type=a>...&lt/ol></tt>\".\n\n<h4>Displaying Images</h4>\n\n<p>\nTo include an image in your writeup, use the following HTML command:\n\n<tt><blockquote>\n&lt;img src=\"imageName.png\">\n</blockquote></tt>\n\n<p> \nwhere \"imageName.png\" is in the same directory as your \"index.html\" file.\nIf your image is in a subdirectory, then include the path:\n\n<tt><blockquote>\n&lt;img src=\"someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png\">\n</blockquote></tt>\n\n<p>If your image is too large, then make sure to set its width (or height):\n\n<tt><blockquote>\n&lt;img width=300 src=\"someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png\">\n</blockquote></tt>\n\n<p>If you also want to link to the original high resolution image (which\nyou may as well always do), then wrap the \"img\" tag in an hyperlink\ntag:\n\n<tt><blockquote>\n&lt;a href=\"someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png\"><br>\n&lt;img width=300 src=\"someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png\"><br>\n&lt/a>\n</blockquote></tt>\n\n<h4>Special Characters</h4>\n\n<p> \nBecause HTML uses the less than sign to begin a tag, you need\nto use a special command to generate a less than sign.  This command\nis \"<tt>&amp;lt;</tt>\".\n\n<p> \nLikewise, because HTML uses the ampersand to begin the command for\na special character like less than, use the following command\nto generate an ampersand: \n\"<tt>&amp;amp;</tt>\".\n\n<h4>Equations</h4>\n\n<p> \nHTML is really bad for typsetting mathematics.  For this class,\nany homework problem that requires you to write equations can be\nsubmitted on paper.  If you want to use typeset equations, then\nyou have a few options.  First, you can simply use plain text,\nsuch as MATLAB syntax.  Second, you can supplement plain text\nwith the few equation commands that exist in HTML (explained more below).\nAnd third, you can generate the equations as images using some other\nprogram.  This last option is what sites such as Mathworld use.\nIf you have a Mac, I recommend any of the following great little tools:\nLaTeX Equation Editor, PDF Equation, or LaTeXiT.\n\n<p>\nThat there are a couple of HTML\ncommands that help with simple equations.  Here are some examples:\n\n<ul>\n\n<p><li> Subscripts: \"<tt>x&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></tt>\" produces x<sub>i</sub>.\n<p><li> Superscripts: \"<tt>x&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup></tt>\" produces x<sup>2</sup>.\n<p><li> Greek letters: \n\"<tt>&amp;alpha;</tt>\" produces &alpha;,\n\"<tt>&amp;beta;</tt>\" produces &beta;,\n\"<tt>&amp;gamma;</tt>\" produces &gamma;,\netc.\n<p><li> Miscellaneous math symbols:\n&plusmn;, &Sigma;, &Pi;, &radic;, &infin;, &int;, &le;,\n&ge;, &ne;, etc.  \n</ul>\n\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html\">Here\nis a more comprehensive list</a> of HTML commands for both\ngreek letters and math symbols.\n\n<h4>More Information</h4>\n\nWant to learn more?  I've discussed only a few HTML commands here.\nThere are many more commands available, all of which you may use, and\nnone of which you need to use.  \nThe web is well populated with HTML\ntutorials.  I\nfind <a\nhref=\"http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com\">http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com</a>\nto be a particularly useful reference for HTML tags.
