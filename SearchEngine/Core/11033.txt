colours suffice to have no two points on the plane at a distance of 1 inch Or prove that 4 colours do not suffice Anybody know of any references Vijay Raghavan This is indeed a long standing problem Usually stated as follows Let G be the graph with vertices the points of the plane and two points joined if they are at distance one from each other Then the question is What is the chromatic number of this graph the smallest number of colours with which the vertices can be coloured so that adjacent vertices have different colours This is one of Paul Erdos pet problems and I have heard him speak on it a couple of times The known results from memory and now at least a couple of years old are 1 The graph can be 7 coloured try a hexagonal tessellation 2 There is a configuration that requires 4 colours the one demanded by the Putnam problem will do Thus if chi is the chromatic number then 4 chi 7 Other than that the true number could be anywhere A typical combinatorial puzzler easy to state impossible to prove A further result due to Erdos is that if this graph requires k colours then some FINITE subgraph of it also requires k colours However there is no immediate reason to believe that if there IS a configuration that requires 5 colours then it is on less than billions of vertices substitute your own large number Similar problems have also been studied for the integer line where you join two integers if they differ by an amount in some fixed set say 1 2 5 or whatever This is all from memory and I have no references so anyone with more up to date info please feel free to correct
