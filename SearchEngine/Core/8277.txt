{"text": "CompSci 165 Course Grading Project Grading There is a checklist of criteria specific for each project Points are assigned to various aspects and characteristics of the submission The total points available is completely arbitrary may vary by project and it is a mere coincidence if they add to 1 The sum of the points awarded is the Point Sum for that project The Point Sum is used as a guideline to help in assigning a letter grade for that project submission The Point Sum is translated into a Grade using a non linear mapping Generally the meaning of a Grade is as follows A excellent B quite good C fair just adequate D passing because the grader was charitable F failing H below failing not a credible effort or nothing submitted Grades A thru D may have an appended or modifier Course Grading In computing course averages it is hard dealing with letters Each project letter Grade is converted into a Mark that ranges from to 1 using a linear mapping for A thru D and a non linear mapping for F and H Your Course Average is then computed as follows the worst of your 3 project Marks counts 2 the other 2 project Marks each count 4 bonus 2 given for submitting course evaluation Your course grade is the Grade closest to your Course Average applying the reverse linear mapping Last modified Mar 13 2 14", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/class/165/coursegrade.html", "title": "course grading", "html": "<HTML><HEAD>\n<TITLE>Course Grading</TITLE>\n</HEAD><BODY>\n<span style=\"color:#000000; font:16px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\n\n<H1 align=center>CompSci 165 Course Grading</H1>\n\n<H2>Project Grading</H2>\n\n<UL>\n   <LI> There is a checklist of criteria specific for each project.\n   <LI> Points are assigned to various aspects and characteristics of\n        the submission.\n     <BR> ( The total points available is completely arbitrary,\n        may vary by project, and it is a mere coincidence if they add to 100. )\n   <LI> The sum of the points awarded is the <I>Point Sum</I> for that project.\n     <BR> The Point Sum is used as a guideline to help in assigning\n        a letter grade for that project submission.\n   <LI> The Point Sum is translated into a <I>Grade</I> using a non-linear mapping.\n        Generally, the meaning of a <I>Grade</I> is as follows:\n        <UL>\n          <LI> A  excellent\n          <LI> B  quite good\n          <LI> C  fair, just adequate\n          <LI> D  passing, because the grader was charitable\n          <LI> F  failing\n          <LI> H  below failing... not a credible effort or nothing submitted\n        </UL>\n   <LI> Grades A thru D may have an appended + or - modifier.\n</UL>\n\n<H2>Course Grading</H2>\n\n<UL>\n  <LI> In computing course averages, it is hard dealing with letters.\n  <LI> Each project letter <I>Grade</I> is converted into a <I>Mark</I>\n       that ranges from 0 to 100, using a linear mapping for A thru D and a non-linear mapping for F and H.\n  <LI> Your <I>Course Average</I> is then computed as follows.\n       <UL>\n         <LI> the worst of your 3 project Marks counts 20%\n         <LI> the other 2 project Marks each count 40%\n         <LI> bonus 2% given for submitting course evaluation\n       </UL>\n  <LI> Your course grade is the <I>Grade</I> closest to your Course Average,\n       applying the reverse linear mapping.\n</UL>\n\n<P>\n\n</span>\n<HR>\nLast modified: Mar 13, 2014\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 8277.0}
