Temporal Constraint Satisfaction is an information technology useful for \r\nrepresenting and answering queries about the times of events and the temporal relations between them.\r\nInformation is represented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where variables denote\r\nevent times and constraints represent the possible temporal relations between them. The main\r\ntasks are two: (i) deciding consistency, and (ii) answering queries about scenarios that satisfy\r\nall constraints. This paper overviews results on several classes of Temporal CSPs: qualitative\r\ninterval, qualitative point, metric point, and some of their combinations. Research has progressed\r\nalong three lines: (i) identifying tractable subclasses, (ii) developing exact search algorithms, and\r\n(iii) developing polynomial-time approximation algorithms. Most available techniques are based\r\non two principles: (i) enforcing local consistency (e.g. path-consistency), and (ii) enhancing naive\r\nbacktracking search.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r66.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r66.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8723.0}
