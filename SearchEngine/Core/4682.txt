Industries with more than 4% annual productivity growth in the 1990's include tires, textiles, household appliances, and aircraft.</P>\r\n\r\n<B><P>The Innovators</B>--Widely used innovations such as wireless telephones, internet browsers, improved drug treatments for depression, and automated teller machines may not be correctly counted in the economic statistics for years.</P>\r\n\r\n<B><P>The Unmeasured</B>--In sectors such as health care, education, government, and much of financial services, economists disagree what the proper measure of productivity is, much less how to calculate it.</P>\r\n\r\n<B><P>The Laggards</B>--Many industries have low or even negative productivity gains.  For example, productivity in food stores fell at an average rate of 0.9% from 1989 to 1997 (the last year available).  Other industries showing less than 2% annual gains in the 1990's include hotels and motels, restaurants, car dealers, auto repair shops, and furniture manufacturers.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>Source:  Business Week, 29 Nov 99, p 42</P>\r\n\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=5><P>Logistics</P>\r\n<P>&#9;Sexual Harassment brochure</P>\r\n<P>&#9;project topics</P>\r\n<P>&#9;deliverable schedule</P>\r\n<P>&#9;quiz next Monday</P>\r\n<P>&#9;section assignments</P>\r\n<P>&#9;Lunch program</P>\r\n<P>&#9;Career fair</P>\r\n<P>&#9;Library briefing</P>\r\n<P>&#9;Adds-drops</P>\r\n</B></FONT><FONT FACE=\"TIMES\" SIZE=4>\r\n<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>\r\n\r\n<P>&#9;&#9;</P>\r\n\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"TIMES\"><P>&nbsp;</P></FONT></BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "id": 4682.0}
