We describe algorithms for constructing Lombardi drawings of\nregular graphs, 2-degenerate graphs, graphs with rotational symmetry,\nand several types of planar graphs.

If we are allowed to permute the children of\neach node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which\nall edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a\npolynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child\nordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show\nthat, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the\nedges as circular arcs (a style we call <a\nhref=\"p-lombardi.html\">Lombardi drawing</a>) then even with a prescribed\nchild ordering we can achieve polynomial area.\n<p>\n<li><b>Planar and poly-arc Lombardi drawings</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www2.latech.edu/~duncan/\">C.
