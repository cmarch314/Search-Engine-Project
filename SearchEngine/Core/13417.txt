Eppstein.<br>\nTutorial at\n10th Int. Meshing Roundtable, Newport Beach, 2001.\n<p>\nDelaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation\nfor a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually\npleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various\nmeasures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the\nmaximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on\nconstruction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including\nrecent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"Epp-IMR-01.pdf\">slides</a> --\n<a href=\"http://fano.ics.uci.edu/cites/Document/Global-optimization-of-mesh-quality.html\">Citations</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Diamond-kite meshes: adaptive quadrilateral meshing and orthogonal circle packing</b>.<br>\nD.
