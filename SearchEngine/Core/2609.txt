re enrolled in important since I m teaching more than one this quarter Course staff In addition to me this course is staffed by a number of folks in a couple of different roles They are listed below Teaching assistants There are two teaching assistants who will share the duties of attending the lab meetings and will be the primary points of contact with regard to the grading of projects Boyang

course s size attendance is not graded but we certainly recommend it Naturally attendance is required on the days when exams are held which are listed in the Schedule Lab Meetings While there are no scheduled lab sections in this course we will be offering informal lab meetings throughout the week beginning on Tuesday October 14 The lab meetings will all be held in ICS2 162 note that this is the

programming so it will be handy to have a place you can go to get help keep this on your calendar You re free to come and go as you d like within that time there are no sections or other formal arrangement Lab meetings are not a required part of the course and nothing will be graded in the labs this quarter but attendance does offer some significant benefits You will have a chance to consult a TA and one or more lab tutors regarding your work this kind of instant feedback and help can be invaluable as you work through your projects Some of your work this quarter will be done in pairs using a technique called pair programming The lab sections offer built in overlap in your and your partner s schedules You will be surrounded by a large group of other people facing the same problems that you re facing This kind of shared journey will build a social network that will last you in some cases for the rest of your life Don t squander that opportunity Office hours I will be available on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 45 9 15pm in ICS 225 not my office as it s in a building that will be locked during at least part of that time during which I m available to chat with you about whatever s on your mind Textbooks There is an optional textbook for the course listed below Absolute C 5th Edtionby Walter Savitch and Kenrick MockAddison Wesley 2 12ISBN 132 83 71 XOPTIONAL There are at least a couple of ways to get the textbook purchasing a hard copy from online booksellers such as Amazon or renting an electronic edition from CourseSmart with the CourseSmart option being significantly cheaper but only allowing you to view the text for six months Note that while I will be assigning readings from this textbook that correspond to our lectures the goal is to complement the lecture material and help you fill in details that you missed while listening to me speak for eighty minutes I will not be testing you on details from the textbook that were not discussed in lecture or covered on projects If you find that you d prefer to work without a textbook or even work with a different book or online supplements of your own choosing that s fine the overall goal is to learn C and I m not especially finicky about how you do it Obtaining additional assistance Asking questions of course staff You can most easily get course questions answered by coming to the lecture the lab meetings or office hours and asking them I am happy to help you in person when I m available You can also ask questions by sending email to me or your TA or both we check our email frequently throughout the day so you can usually get an answer to course related questions within a few hours and often much more quickly If the questions require a complex or lengthy response we may ask you to see one of us in person As projects approach their due date particularly on days when projects are due we begin to receive quite a bit of email all at once so we may not be able to respond to all messages before the project is due We aren t ignoring you on purpose but unfortunately it s not always possible for the relatively small course staff to answer questions from a large number of students at once A great way to mitigate this problem is to get started early and ask questions sooner in the process Accommodations for disabilities Any students who feel that they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss these specific needs Also contact the Disability Services Center online or by phone at 949 824 7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations such as alternative test taking environments or note taking services can be arranged for you in a timely way Grading Weights of graded artifacts Your course grade will be determined from the weighted combination of your scores on each of six programming projects one Midterm and one Final Exam The weights of each of these are One set up project 2 Four projects 4 weighted equally at 1 each Midterm 25 Final Exam 33 Determining final grades Course grades will be determined neither on a normal curve nor a straight scale It is guaranteed that overall scores over 9 will receive an A or better scores over 8 will receive a B or better and scores over 7 will receive a C or better However the actual cutoffs may be lowered at the end of the quarter In short it is not my intention to fail half of the students nor am I planning on giving only 2 of the students A s but I prefer not to constrain myself with either a straight scale or a formalized curve If you re curious about how you re doing in the course I m happy to discuss your estimated grade at any time It s generally best to have this conversation in person so that we can explore issues other than just the raw numbers I m happy to have this conversation at any time that I m available and I m also glad to do it via email if we can t find a mutually available time Dropping the course or changing grade option Through the end of Week 2 Friday October 17 you may drop the course by simply going to WebReg and dropping it If you wish to drop the course after that date you will need to use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request a drop I do not have the final say over those ultimately as the Dean of the Bren School and your major if you are majoring in something outside of the Bren School must approve them It is not generally the case that an exception will be accepted simply because you re not doing well in a course though extenuating circumstances are certainly considered Similarly changing your grade option to Pass NotPass or back again can be done via WebReg through the end of Week 2 Friday October 17 after which you must use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request the change As with exceptional drops you must receive approval from the appropriate Deans Academic honesty The policy As ICS 45C or CSE 45C students you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole Please take a few minutes to read the policies which can be found at this link All of your project work is expected to be completed solely by you Worker in larger groups and or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted Note that high level discussion of course material for better understanding is permitted and encouraged but when it comes time to sit down and write code that is expected to be done by you and you alone All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions even when there are superficial differences Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in or even refer to code written by a friend of yours who took the course already Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else s work Academic honesty is a two way street Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted any more than turning in someone else s code Resist the temptation to give code to your friends for reference Based on my experience I can say that your friends may very well betray you and turn it in anyway and then you ll have a lot to answer for Naturally the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors registering for computing minors joining the ICS Honors Program and graduating from a computing major with honors The lesson Okay so the moral of the story is that it s wise to avoid cheating I believe that it s relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it why come to UCI if you re not planning to get something out of the coursework So why do people cheat every quarter in every course The answers vary but here s the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I ve had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years I fell behind and couldn t figure out how to catch up Things happen and ten week quarters are unforgiving You might get sick you might have issues crop up in your family you might have misunderstood one of the earlier topics in the course on which later topics dependend you might have an off campus job that s demanding too much of your time you might be trying to decide whether you re on the path you want to be on Any of those things and many others can make it hard to keep up You fall a little behind you fall a little further behind and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless You re under pressure temptation gets the better of you and suddenly it seems better to submit someone else s work than to submit nothing It s not If you feel like you re beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control the best thing to do is to talk to us sooner rather than later We re here to help we understand But the reality of taking large sized courses at a large sized institution is that we re not going to know you re in need unless you tell us If things are happening in your life tell us you don t have to be specific if you re not comfortable with it Before the fact there s often a way to work things out After the fact it s usually too late ", "_id":

Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of your project work is expected to be completed <i>solely by you</i>.

All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system.

I believe that it's relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it; why come to UCI if you're not planning to get something out of the coursework?  So why do people cheat every quarter in every course?  The answers vary, but here's the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I've had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years: <i>I fell behind and couldn't figure out how to catch up</i>.  Things happen and ten-week quarters are unforgiving.  You might get sick, you might have issues crop up in your family, you might have misunderstood one of the earlier topics in the course on which later topics dependend, you might have an off-campus job that's demanding too much of your time, you might be trying to decide whether you're on the path you want to be on... Any of those things (and many others) can make it hard to keep up.  You fall a little behind, you fall a little further behind, and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless.  You're under pressure, temptation gets the better of you, and suddenly it seems better to submit someone else's work than to submit nothing.  It's not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel like you're beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control, the best thing to do is to talk to us <i>sooner rather than later</i>.  We're here to help; we understand.  But the reality of taking large-sized courses at a large-sized institution is that we're not going to know you're in need unless you tell us.  If things are happening in your life, tell us; you don't have to be specific if you're not comfortable with it.  Before the fact, there's often a way to work things out.
