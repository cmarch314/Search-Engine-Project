Version 3 29 June 2 734 Copyright C 2 7 Free Software Foundation Inc http fsf org 5 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies6 of this license document but changing it is not allowed 78 Preamble91 The GNU General Public License is a free copyleft license for11software and other kinds of works 1213 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed14to take away your freedom to share and change the works By contrast 15the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to16share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free17software for all its users We the Free Software Foundation use the18GNU General Public License for most of our software it applies also to19any other work released this way by its authors You can apply it to2 your programs too 2122 When we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not23price Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you24have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for25them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you26want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new27free programs and that you know you can do these things 2829 To protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you3 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights Therefore you have31certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if32you modify it responsibilities to respect the freedom of others 3334 For example if you distribute copies of such a program whether35gratis or for a fee you must pass on to the recipients the same36freedoms that you received You must make sure that they too receive37or can get the source code And you must show them these terms so they38know their rights 394 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps 41 1 assert copyright on the software and 2 offer you this License42giving you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify it 4344 For the developers and authors protection the GPL clearly explains45that there is no warranty for this free software For both users and46authors sake the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as47changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to48authors of previous versions 495 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run51modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer52can do so This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of53protecting users freedom to change the software The systematic54pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to55use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable Therefore we56have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those57products If such problems arise substantially in other domains we58stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions59of the GPL as needed to protect the freedom of users 6 61 Finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents 62States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of63software on general purpose computers but in those that do we wish to64avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could65make it effectively proprietary To prevent this the GPL assures that66patents cannot be used to render the program non free 6768 The precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and69modification follow 7 71 TERMS AND CONDITIONS7273 Definitions 7475 This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License 7677 Copyright also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of78works such as semiconductor masks 798 The Program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this81License Each licensee is addressed as you Licensees and82 recipients may be individuals or organizations 8384 To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work85in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an86exact copy The resulting work is called a modified version of the87earlier work or a work based on the earlier work 8889 A covered work means either the unmodified Program or a work based9 on the Program 9192 To propagate a work means to do anything with it that without93permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for94infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a95computer or modifying a private copy Propagation includes copying 96distribution with or without modification making available to the97public and in some countries other activities as well 9899 To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other1 parties to make or receive copies Mere interaction with a user through1 1a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying 1 21 3 An interactive user interface displays Appropriate Legal Notices 1 4to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible1 5feature that 1 displays an appropriate copyright notice and 2 1 6tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the1 7extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the1 8work under this License and how to view a copy of this License If1 9the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a11 menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion 111112 1 Source Code 113114 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work115for making modifications to it Object code means any non source116form of a work 117118 A Standard Interface means an interface that either is an official119standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of12 interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that121is widely used among developers working in that language 122123 The System Libraries of an executable work include anything other124than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of125packaging a Major Component but which is not part of that Major126Component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that127Major Component or to implement a Standard Interface for which an128implementation is available to the public in source code form A129 Major Component in this context means a major essential component13 kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system131 if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to132produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it 133134 The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all135the source code needed to generate install and for an executable136work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to137control those activities However it does not include the work s138System Libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free139programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but14 which are not part of the work For example Corresponding Source141includes interface definition files associated with source files for142the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically143linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require 144such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those145subprograms and other parts of the work 146147 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users148can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding149Source 15 151 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that152same work 153154 2 Basic Permissions 155156 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of157copyright on the Program and are irrevocable provided the stated158conditions are met This License explicitly affirms your unlimited159permission to run the unmodified Program The output from running a16 covered work is covered by this License only if the output given its161content constitutes a covered work This License acknowledges your162rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law 163164 You may make run and propagate covered works that you do not165convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains166in force You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose167of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you168with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with169the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do17 not control copyright Those thus making or running the covered works171for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction172and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of173your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you 174175 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under176the conditions stated below Sublicensing is not allowed section 1 177makes it unnecessary 178179 3 Protecting Users Legal Rights From Anti Circumvention Law 18 181 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological182measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article18311 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 2 December 1996 or184similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such185measures 186187 When you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid188circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention189is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to19 the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or191modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s192users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of193technological measures 194195 4 Conveying Verbatim Copies 196197 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program s source code as you198receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and199appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 2 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any2 1non permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code 2 2keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all2 3recipients a copy of this License along with the Program 2 42 5 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey 2 6and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee 2 72 8 5 Conveying Modified Source Versions 2 921 You may convey a work based on the Program or the modifications to211produce it from the Program in the form of source code under the212terms of section 4 provided that you also meet all of these conditions 213214 a The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified215 it and giving a relevant date 216217 b The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is218 released under this License and any conditions added under section219 7 This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to22 keep intact all notices 221222 c You must license the entire work as a whole under this223 License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy This224 License will therefore apply along with any applicable section 7225 additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts 226 regardless of how they are packaged This License gives no227 permission to license the work in any other way but it does not228 invalidate such permission if you have separately received it 22923 d If the work has interactive user interfaces each must display231 Appropriate Legal Notices however if the Program has interactive232 interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices your233 work need not make them do so 234235 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent236works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work 237and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program 238in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an239 aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not24 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users241beyond what the individual works permit Inclusion of a covered work242in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other243parts of the aggregate 244245 6 Conveying Non Source Forms 246247 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms248of sections 4 and 5 provided that you also convey the249machine readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License 25 in one of these ways 251252 a Convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product253 including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the254 Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium255 customarily used for software interchange 256257 b Convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product258 including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a259 written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as26 long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product261 model to give anyone who possesses the object code either 1 a262 copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the263 product that is covered by this License on a durable physical264 medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no265 more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this266 conveying of source or 2 access to copy the267 Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge 268269 c Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the27 written offer to provide the Corresponding Source This271 alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and272 only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord273 with subsection 6b 274275 d Convey the object code by offering access from a designated276 place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the277 Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no278 further charge You need not require recipients to copy the279 Corresponding Source along with the object code If the place to28 copy the object code is a network server the Corresponding Source281 may be on a different server operated by you or a third party 282 that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain283 clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the284 Corresponding Source Regardless of what server hosts the285 Corresponding Source you remain obligated to ensure that it is286 available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements 287288 e Convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided289 you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding29 Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no291 charge under subsection 6d 292293 A separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded294from the Corresponding Source as a System Library need not be295included in conveying the object code work 296297 A User Product is either 1 a consumer product which means any298tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family 299or household purposes or 2 anything designed or sold for incorporation3 into a dwelling In determining whether a product is a consumer product 3 1doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage For a particular3 2product received by a particular user normally used refers to a3 3typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status3 4of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user3 5actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product A product3 6is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial3 7commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent3 8the only significant mode of use of the product 3 931 Installation Information for a User Product means any methods 311procedures authorization keys or other information required to install312and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from313a modified version of its Corresponding Source The information must314suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object315code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because316modification has been made 317318 If you convey an object code work under this section in or with or319specifically for use in a User Product and the conveying occurs as32 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the321User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a322fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the323Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied324by the Installation Information But this requirement does not apply325if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install326modified object code on the User Product for example the work has327been installed in ROM 328329 The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a33 requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates331for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for332the User Product in which it has been modified or installed Access to a333network may be denied when the modification itself materially and334adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and335protocols for communication across the network 336337 Corresponding Source conveyed and Installation Information provided 338in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly339documented and with an implementation available to the public in34 source code form and must require no special password or key for341unpacking reading or copying 342343 7 Additional Terms 344345 Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this346License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions 347Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall348be treated as though they were included in this License to the extent349that they are valid under applicable law If additional permissions35 apply only to part of the Program that part may be used separately351under those permissions but the entire Program remains governed by352this License without regard to the additional permissions 353354 When you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option355remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of356it Additional permissions may be written to require their own357removal in certain cases when you modify the work You may place358additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work 359for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission 36 361 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License for material you362add to a covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of363that material supplement the terms of this License with terms 364365 a Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the366 terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License or367368 b Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or369 author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal37 Notices displayed by works containing it or371372 c Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or373 requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in374 reasonable ways as different from the original version or375376 d Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or377 authors of the material or378379 e Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some38 trade names trademarks or service marks or381382 f Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that383 material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of384 it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for385 any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on386 those licensors and authors 387388 All other non permissive additional terms are considered further389restrictions within the meaning of section 1 If the Program as you39 received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is391governed by this License along with a term that is a further392restriction you may remove that term If a license document contains393a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this394License you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms395of that license document provided that the further restriction does396not survive such relicensing or conveying 397398 If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you399must place in the relevant source files a statement of the4 additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating4 1where to find the applicable terms 4 24 3 Additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the4 4form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions 4 5the above requirements apply either way 4 64 7 8 Termination 4 84 9 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly41 provided under this License Any attempt otherwise to propagate or411modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under412this License including any patent licenses granted under the third413paragraph of section 11 414415 However if you cease all violation of this License then your416license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a 417provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and418finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright419holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means42 prior to 6 days after the cessation 421422 Moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is423reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the424violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have425received notice of violation of this License for any work from that426copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 3 days after427your receipt of the notice 428429 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the43 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under431this License If your rights have been terminated and not permanently432reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same433material under section 1 434435 9 Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies 436437 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or438run a copy of the Program Ancillary propagation of a covered work439occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission44 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance However 441nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or442modify any covered work These actions infringe copyright if you do443not accept this License Therefore by modifying or propagating a444covered work you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so 445446 1 Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients 447448 Each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically449receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and45 propagate that work subject to this License You are not responsible451for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License 452453 An entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an454organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an455organization or merging organizations If propagation of a covered456work results from an entity transaction each party to that457transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever458licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could459give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the46 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest if461the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts 462463 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the464rights granted or affirmed under this License For example you may465not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of466rights granted under this License and you may not initiate litigation467 including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that468any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for469sale or importing the Program or any portion of it 47 471 11 Patents 472473 A contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this474License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based The475work thus licensed is called the contributor s contributor version 476477 A contributor s essential patent claims are all patent claims478owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or479hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted48 by this License of making using or selling its contributor version 481but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a482consequence of further modification of the contributor version For483purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant484patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of485this License 486487 Each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free488patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to489make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and49 propagate the contents of its contributor version 491492 In the following three paragraphs a patent license is any express493agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent494 such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to495sue for patent infringement To grant such a patent license to a496party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a497patent against the party 498499 If you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license 5 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone5 1to copy free of charge and under the terms of this License through a5 2publicly available network server or other readily accessible means 5 3then you must either 1 cause the Corresponding Source to be so5 4available or 2 arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the5 5patent license for this particular work or 3 arrange in a manner5 6consistent with the requirements of this License to extend the patent5 7license to downstream recipients Knowingly relying means you have5 8actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the5 9covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work51 in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that511country that you have reason to believe are valid 512513 If pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or514arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a515covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties516receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify517or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license518you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered519work and works based on it 52 521 A patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within522the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is523conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are524specifically granted under this License You may not convey a covered525work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is526in the business of distributing software under which you make payment527to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying528the work and under which the third party grants to any of the529parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory53 patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work531conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily532for and in connection with specific products or compilations that533contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement 534or that patent license was granted prior to 28 March 2 7 535536 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting537any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may538otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law 53954 12 No Surrender of Others Freedom 541542 If conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or543otherwise that contradict the conditions of this License they do not544excuse you from the conditions of this License If you cannot convey a545covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this546License and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may547not convey it at all For example if you agree to terms that obligate you548to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey549the Program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this55 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program 551552 13 Use with the GNU Affero General Public License 553554 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License you have555permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed556under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single557combined work and to convey the resulting work The terms of this558License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work 559but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License 56 section 13 concerning interaction through a network will apply to the561combination as such 562563 14 Revised Versions of this License 564565 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions of566the GNU General Public License from time to time Such new versions will567be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to568address new problems or concerns 56957 Each version is given a distinguishing version number If the571Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General572Public License or any later version applies to it you have the573option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered574version or of any later version published by the Free Software575Foundation If the Program does not specify a version number of the576GNU General Public License you may choose any version ever published577by the Free Software Foundation 578579 If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future58 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used that proxy s581public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you582to choose that version for the Program 583584 Later license versions may give you additional or different585permissions However no additional obligations are imposed on any586author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a587later version 588589 15 Disclaimer of Warranty 59 591 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY592APPLICABLE LAW EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT593HOLDERS AND OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY594OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 595THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR596PURPOSE THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM597IS WITH YOU SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF598ALL NECESSARY SERVICING REPAIR OR CORRECTION 5996 16 Limitation of Liability 6 16 2 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING6 3WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND OR CONVEYS6 4THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES INCLUDING ANY6 5GENERAL SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE6 6USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF6 7DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD6

15 and 16 613614 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided615above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms 616reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates617an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the618Program unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a619copy of the Program in return for a fee 62 621 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS622623 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs624625 If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest626possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it627free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms 628629 To do so attach the following notices to the program It is safest63 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively631state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least632the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found 633634 one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does 635 Copyright C year name of author 636637 This program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify638 it under
