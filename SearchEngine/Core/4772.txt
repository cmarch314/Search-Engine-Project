{"text": "FALL QUARTER 2 3 Information and Computer Science UC Irvine ICS 1 A Course Reference INFORMATION PRESENTATION AND REPRESENTATION Instructor David G Kay 4 6B Computer Science kay uci edu Teaching assistant Shubha Tandon tandons ics uci edu Course goals This course will introduce you to modern computing from three perspectives Practical computing skills including word processing spreadsheets and Internet tools like electronic mail and the World Wide Web You will learn these techniques primarily in discussion section and through lab assignments Computer skills like any skills are learned mainly through practice and experience a year of lectures on riding bicycles or playing piano won t bring you much closer to doing it yourself and the same is true of using a computer productively Computer literacy a broad view of how computers work what they do how they have developed and how they may affect us now and in the future As you know technology changes rapidly By taking a broad perspective and looking at underlying principles e g what an operating system does and how it works rather than just what commands to use in Windows or on a Mac to accomplish some specific task your understanding will last you beyond next year s new models and versions Information literacy We often hear that we live in an information age and suffer from information overload You will learn how to find information what forms it may take how to evaluate it for accuracy and reliability and how to present it most effectively to others Our overall goal is to give you a basic framework for making intelligent decisions about computers and computing We don t expect most students in ICS 1 A to have careers as computer professionals but most of you will purchase computing equipment manage computing professionals and make political business and personal decisions that depend on an understanding of computing Meeting place and times Lecture meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 3 to 1 5 in Social Ecology II room 13 4 You must also enroll in the discussion section which meets Monday Wednesday Friday at 11 in Social Science Lab 29 and one of the two lab sections MWF at 12 or MWF at 1 in Computer Science 183 Office hours Starting the second week I will be in or near my office during these scheduled hours during which course related matters will have first priority Wednesdays from 2 3 to 3 3 and Thursdays from 2 15 to 3 Of course emergencies may come up but I will try to give advance notice of any change If I m not immersed in something else I ll be glad to answer short questions whenever I m in my office so feel free to drop by any time I ll also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week The quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail as described below Questions and announcements You can usually get a response to your course related questions within a few hours perhaps a bit longer on the weekends by sending electronic mail to the address ics1 a uci edu This goes to all of us and whoever reads it first can respond If you need to reach one of us individually our individual addresses are listed above We may also send course announcements by Email to the official course mailing list so you should check your Email regularly Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar has for you your UCInet ID if you prefer to read your Email on another account you should set your UCInet account to forward Email to your preferred account see http phwww cwis uci edu cgi bin phupdate This course has a home page at http eee uci edu 3f 362 which you can reach from the instructor s home page http www ics uci edu kay official course Email is archived at http eee uci edu 3f w3m3 362 and a course Note Board for student to student discussions is available when you log on to eee uci edu Labs and lab hours As shown above each student in ICS 1 A has three section meetings a week on Monday Wednesday and Friday The first hour of each meeting is in a classroom the second hour is in the computer lab CS 183 Although you are perfectly welcome to use your own machine for your lab work in this class you should take advantage of these scheduled times when your TA and classmates will be present For some assignments we will expect you and a classmate to work as a pair for any assignment you should feel free to help your classmates though of course that stops short of copying someone else s work and the person receiving the help should be sure to understand how to do the task not just what the answer is The ICS 1 A TA will be available in the lab during the scheduled lab sections TAs won t simply give you answers to your problems but they will help you find the answers yourself it s essential that you develop your own independent skills since you won t always have an expert available to help you Other useful addresses The Engineering Copy Center ECC in room 2 3 of Engineering Tower is where we may place some supplementary course materials such as a sample midterm the ECC is open 8 12 and 1 4 3 Monday through Friday Textbooks Each of these is available or will be shortly in the UCI Bookstore Fluency with Information Technology by Lawrence Snyder This text covers the main content of the course The text s web page is http www aw com snyder Visual Statistical Thinking Displays of Evidence for Decision Making by Edward R Tufte This reprint of Chapter 2 of Tufte s book Visual Explanations describes two situations where the way information was presented had life or death consequences The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint by Edward R Tufte This short monograph takes a critical look at the use of PowerPoint a pervasive means of presenting information Additional materials You will need a few diskettes standard 1 4MB floppy disks this quarter starting with the first lab assignment You can buy them at the ECC the UCI Computer Store and off campus Course structure Approximately eight assignments some with pencil and paper some on the computer in the lab typically due at the start of Wednesday s section 35 of the course grade All the assignments will be available at the following Web address where it will be up to you to find and read them http www ics uci edu kay courses 1 a hw One midterm Given in class on Tuesday October 28 25 One final exam On Thursday December 11 from 8 to 1 a m 4 Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating your work go to him or her first for any questions about grading or scoring If that does not resolve your question then see the instructor The TAs and instructor will be happy to correct any errors that do occur but we must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the item is returned the course moves quickly and we simply can t deal with assignments long past We determine final grades neither on a formal curve with equal numbers of As and Fs Bs and Ds etc nor on a fixed straight scale Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been significantly lower this means that you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates If you re concerned check with your TA or the instructor The basic scale is grades in the A range A A and in exceptional cases A 9 and above grades in the B range 8 9 grades in the C range 7 8 We re required to say that in unusual circumstances these criteria could change but we do not expect that to happen What you must do this week to get started in ICS 1 A If you do not have a UCInet ID an account on the EA system for reading electronic mail get one See http www oac uci edu computing activate html If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your UCInet account redirect your mail at http phwww cwis uci edu cgi bin phupdate On the Web go to checkmate ics uci edu log in with your UCInet ID choose Course Listing for Fall 2 3 click Go next to ICS 1 A and then click List me for this course You ll submit most of your work electronically this step is necessary to set that up If you do not have an ICS account for access to the Windows network in ICS get one See http www ics uci edu lab procedures activate html Get at least one diskette and a lab printing key card Be sure to attend your discussion and lab sections this week If necessary brush up on your basic skills for browsing the Web reading and sending Email preparing simple documents using Word and finding programs and files on the Windows system in the lab Give a snapshot of yourself with your name written on the back to your TA This will help us learn your names quickly This is not just for fun it s a course requirement Also turn in your signed Questionnaire to your TA in discussion section Good advice and helpful hints Make every effort to attend the lectures we will make important announcements and often cover material that isn t found in the textbook It s not fair to ask the TAs simply to repeat lecture material you missed though of course they will answer questions about it Attend your discussion section too assignments will be distributed discussed and collected there exams will be reviewed there and you can ask more questions there than you can in lecture Discussion section is where you will get advice and information specific to the lab assignments missing your section is like doing the assignments with both hands tied behind your back Don t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you If you find yourself having trouble or getting behind speak with your TA or the instructor But never take the shortcut of copying someone else s work and turning it in the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment ICS takes academic honesty very seriously for a more complete discussion see the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty issues http www ics uci edu ucounsel continuing students cheat html Check your electronic mail regularly this is an official channel for course announcements Be sure to read each assignment over and think about how to solve it before you come to lab The lab assignments like all technical specifications require careful and thorough reading and re reading Expect to refer back to the assignment often and check it first when you have questions about what s required or how to proceed Start early doing the lab assignments Please remember that computing assignments always take longer to complete than you think they will even if you have previous experience Pitfalls and stumbling blocks are an inevitable part of computing surely you ve seen dozens of cartoons showing people frustrated with their computers of course these problems aren t ever foreseeable so the only effective strategy is to allow more time than you think you will need By starting early you ll have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter Always keep your own copy of each assignment both on diskette and on paper if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle or if a file server in the lab should crash which has happened we ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily Keep up with the reading you ll need it to do your assignments and the quarter goes so fast that a few missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you re not careful Read the assigned sections early and quickly for the main ideas not to memorize every detail then you can ask your TA in section which parts merit closer attention Students usually receive grades of B or better when they follow this advice nearly everyone who receives lower grades has neglected one or more of these suggestions Approximate course outline Week Date Topic Readings Chapters

Read\nthe assigned sections early and quickly (for the main ideas, not to memorize\nevery detail); then you can ask your TA in section which parts merit closer\nattention.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Students usually receive grades of B or better\nwhen they follow this advice; nearly everyone who receives lower grades\nhas neglected one or more of these suggestions.</FONT></P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=1 WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=1>\n<COL WIDTH=7%><COL WIDTH=14%><COL WIDTH=50%><COL WIDTH=29%>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=7% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=2><U>Week</U></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=14% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=2><U>Date</U></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=50% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=2><U>Topic</U></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=29% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=2><U>Readings (Chapters in Snyder unless otherwise\nspecified)</U></FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=7% VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
