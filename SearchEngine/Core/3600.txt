Two weavings are equivalent if the underlying\narrangements of lines are combinatorially equivalent and the\n\"above-below\" relations are the same. An equivalence class of\nweavings is called a weaving pattern.</p>\n\n<p>In a perfect weaving pattern, along each line l of W, the lines\nintersecting it are alternately \"above\" and \"below\". This paper\ndiscusses the realization of weavings and weaving patterns in\n3-space. The authors prove that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A perfect weaving pattern of n lines is realizable iff\nn&lt;=3</li>\n\n<li>A perfect m by n (bipartite) weaving pattern of line segments\nis realizable iff min(m,n) &lt;= 3</li>\n\n<li>If n -&gt; infinity, then almost all weaving patterns are\nnonrealizable.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Based on a paper by J&aacute;nos Pach, Richard Pollack, and Emo\nWelzl, in <i>Algorithmica</i> 9:561-571, 1993.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3600.0}
