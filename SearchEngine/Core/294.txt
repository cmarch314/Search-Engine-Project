Educational and presentation tools WEB Site SPONSOR BENEFITS Product Testing Each industry sponsor will be provided with access to the lab for testing of product performance interoperability and scalability The average duration for industry usage will be 2 to 4 days Extended industry testing arrangements may be considered by the board in accordance with university research needs All testing will be completed by the industry sponsor and it is expected that the lab will be left in its original state for continuation of university research Sponsors will also have the exclusive option for additional lab usage on a fee for service basis Please note that UCI does not assume legal responsibility for assuring the accuracy of testing completed in the lab Advisory Board The board is comprised of lab faculty and representatives from industry ensuring that sponsors have direct input into activities and policy decisions The board meets on a quarterly basis Technical Reports Subscription to all technical reports published by lab faculty and the Information Computer Science Department Annual Meeting Lab faculty present research findings on an annual basis to share ideas on clustering issues Visiting Researchers Companies have the opportunity to send visiting scholars and have them participate in a faculty member s research group consistent with resource availability Recruiting Lab sponsors will have opportunities to interact with students as well as post job announcements in student labs and electronic bulletin boards LAB OVERVIEW Structure The Lab will have an industry advisory board director support staff and physical facilities such as space computing and networking Funding Industry Sponsorship is 25 Annually Sponsor donations are tax deductible gifts that will be used to enhance research programs in the lab as well as maintain the computing infrastructure Gifts can be made payable to the UCI Foundation and returned to Jennifer Stameson Director of Development UCI 444 Computer Science Bldg Irvine CA 92697 3425 No University overhead costs will be charged against sponsor gifts to the lab In addition to cash contributions the lab accepts tax
