OptimizationAdaptive Software and Hardware for Distributed Networked Embedded SystemsThe project investigates adaptive strategies to deal with dynamic application environments for distributed networked embedded systems covering diverse applications such as the Internet of Things low power mobile systems Department of Computer ScienceAlgorithmic LivingAll of the data collected about us is used to make decisions about what sort of products and financial offers we receive How does this manifest in our self image and what are the historical and legal implications Department of InformaticsApplying Machine Learning and Advanced Computation to CancerIn this project researchers have identified an elusive pocket on the surface of the p53 protein that can be targeted by cancer fighting drugs Department of Computer ScienceAsterixDB Big Data Management 2 AsterixDB is a full function open source next generation Big Data Management System that is designed to scale to very large shared clusters Department of Computer ScienceCloudProtectCloudProtect seeks to develop a middleware so users can employ encryption methods to control risk of data exposure in Cloud based applications Department of Computer ScienceCollaboration Success WizardThis online diagnostic survey looks at how to improve collaborations on projects where workers are spread out geographically The survey probes factors that may strengthen or weaken the collaboration and provides reports that help build productive collaborations Department of InformaticsFault ComprehensionWhen software fails it must be debugged a largely manual process that determines why the program failed This project is creating tools and visualizations that give an automated diagnosis to help software developers create effective and efficient software Department of InformaticsGene Regulation Network GRN InferenceIn collaboration with UCI biologists researchers will use their pioneering GRN mathematical models along with machine learning based inference methods to computationally understand the gene regulation network that determines early endoderm patterning in vertebrates Department of Computer ScienceMachine Learning for Text and Social Network Data over TimeResearchers are developing new statistical machine learning algorithms that can automatically extract useful information from both large bodies of and large social network data sets Department of Computer ScienceModeling Languages for Computational Biology and AIThis project seeks to exploit useful overlap between formally defined scientific modeling languages researchers have developed for computational biology including machine learning techniques for model reduction Department of Computer ScienceModeling and Simulation of Biologically Realistic Brain NetworksIn collaboration with neuroscientists this project develops modeling and simulation frameworks for exploring large spiking neural networks with a specific focus on visually guided motion perception learning tracking and autonomous navigation Department of Computer ScienceMulti tasking in the WorkplaceModern technology has helped create workplaces filled with interruptions influencing work flow and productivity This project studies information workers to figure out ways of mitigating the impact of constant interruptions Department of InformaticsRobust and Flexible Statistical Models for Environmental Epidemiology StudiesResearchers are developing new statistical methods to flexibly estimate the association between spatially and or temporally correlated environmental exposures and the risk of clinical outcomes in humans Department of StatisticsSatwareThis scalable data collection querying and analysis technology allows for the creation of situational awareness applications from across diverse multimodal sensors and data sources Department of Computer ScienceSherlockA pay as you go data cleaning framework Sherlock can improve data quality in near real time application contexts Department of Computer ScienceSimilarity based Program AnalysisThis project explores the idea of using program similarity to find better heuristics that require a lot less time and effort to find a solution Program similarity can be defined in a number of ways and part of this research is seeking to find intrinsic program characteristics that can be used for this purpose Department of Computer ScienceSoftware Engineering for SustainabilityThere is growing awareness that living within the Earth s means is crucial to humanity This sustainability has been focused on engineering advances to reduce waste and energy use But information and computing technology could also play a key role This project seeks to understand the potential of information technology in helping people make smarter decisions and ways in which to make IT software more sustainable Department of InformaticsStatistical Models for Brain ConnectivityUnder the context of decision making this project seeks to develop novel statistical approaches for identifying brain connectivity features from high dimensional multimodal imaging spatio temporal data that can predict human behavior Department of StatisticsTechnologies for Autism Activity CoachFor many people living with autism spectrum disorder remembering detailed schedules can be a challenge A well planned day can be disrupted by a late bus or cancelled work ActivityCoach a mobile application provides support that adapts to changing schedules Department of InformaticsThe I Sensorium ProjectParts of the UCI campus are equipped with a variety of experimental sensing networking storage and computing technologies to convert the campus into a living laboratory Data from I Sensorium infrastructure is driving experimental research on pervasive systems mobile computing situation awareness big data management data streams multimodal event detection and privacy Department of Computer ScienceTrust in Software Development TeamsTeams that are productive tend to have a great amount of trust among the team members In virtual teams trust is difficult to establish This project explores how trust is formed among team members and it s creating tools to help teams that are spread out geographically develop trust Department of InformaticsValues in DesignThis project seeks to understand the personal and cultural values we design into our technologies and how these technologies allow us to express our values For example how do we balance values of efficiency and security with a need for friendliness and fun when we design a new electronic marketplace Department of InformaticsWebRTC Benchmarking and OptimizationWebRTC is an exciting new standard being developed to provide real time communication capabilities between browsers It is a major component of the HTML5 the newest version of HTML protocol under development today This project develops methodology and software for performing multi platform browser independent performance benchmarking The benchmarking results will be used to optimize and improve WebRTC performance on mobile devices Department of Computer Science Copyright
