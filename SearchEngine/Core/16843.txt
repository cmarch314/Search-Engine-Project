CSS provides a forum for both reporting \nresearch \nresults and supporting interaction between academia and industry thereby \nproviding insight into the applicability and utility of research ideas in \ncommercial settings. Emphasis is on early dissemination of new ideas and\nempirical evaluation and on experience with software techniques on actual \nprojects. This annual event provides a unique opportunity for industry \nexposure to expertise, research, and lessons learned from a broad base of \nparticipants.\n<p>\nThe California Software Symposium is the descendant of the Irvine Software\nSymposium (ISS). The symposium series is now co-sponsored by IRUS and \nUSC's \n<A HREF=\"http://sunset.usc.edu/index.html\">\nCenter for Software Engineering (CSE)</A>. \nCSS continues in the path established the\nIrvine Software Symposium and features regional, national, and\ninternational participation.\n<p> \nThis one-day meeting features high quality peer reviewed papers and\npresentations.  A Program Committee, consisting of IRUS and CSE faculty, IRUS\nsponsors, CSE affiliates, and other regional experts, meets to review papers, \npresentations, and panel proposals, choose keynote and invited speakers, \nplan the program, and provide direction. \n<p>\nA formal bound proceedings is published each year. Proceedings of previous \nCSS and ISS have been distributed around the country and beyond, providing \nexcellent exposure.\n\n<p>\n<p>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to IRUS home page</A> \n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\nUniversity of California, Irvine  CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 16843.0}
