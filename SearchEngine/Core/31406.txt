This is an interactive system that recommends restaurants to the user based on factors such as cuisine, price, style, atmosphere, etc. or based on similarity to a restaurant in another city (e.g. find me a restaurant similar to the Patina in Los Angeles). The user can then provide feedback such as find a nicer or less expensive restaurant. \n</p>\n\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!

Data Characteristics \n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2> Data Characteristics</H2>\n\n<p>\nThis data records interactions with <A href=\"http://infolab.ils.nwu.edu/entree/\">Entree Chicago</a> restaurant recommendation system (originally <a href=\"http://infolab.cs.uchicago.edu/entree/\">http://infolab.cs.uchicago.edu/entree</a>) from September, 1996 to April, 1999. The data is organized into files roughly spanning a quarter year -- with Q3 1996 and Q2 1999 each only containing one month.\n\n<p>\nEach line in a session file represents a session of user interaction\nwith the system.  The (tab-separated) fields are as follows:\n\n<PRE>\n     Date, IP, Entry point, Rated restaurant1, ..., Rated restaurantN, End point\n</PRE>\n\n<H4>Entry point</H4>\n<UL>\n   <li> Users can use a restaurant from any city as a entry point, but\n     they always get recommendations for Chicago restaurants.  The\n     entry point therefore draws from a larger universe of\n     restaurants than the rest of the data.\n   <li> Entry points have the form nnnX, where nnn is a numeric\n     restaurant ID and X is a character A-H that encodes the city.\n</UL>\n<PRE>\n     A = Atlanta\n     B = Boston\n     C = Chicago\n     D = Los Angeles\n     E = New Orleans\n     F = New York\n     G = San Francisco\n     H = Washington DC\n</PRE>\n\n<H4>Rated Restaurant</H4>\n<UL>\n   <li> These are all Chicago restaurants.\n   <li> These entries have the form nnnX, where nnn is a numeric\n     restaurant ID and X is a character L-T that encodes the\n     navigation operation.\n</UL>\n<PRE>\n     L = browse (move from one restaurant in a list of recommendations\n     to another)\n     M = cheaper (search for a restaurant like this one, but cheaper)\n     N = nicer   (         \"               \"           , but nicer)\n     O = closer  (unused in the production version of the system)\n     P = more traditional (search for a restaurant like this, but\n         serving more traditional cuisine)\n     Q = more creative (search for a restaurant serving more creative\n         cuisine)\n     R = more lively (search for a restaurant with a livelier\n         atmosphere)\n     S = quieter (search for a restaurant with a quieter atmosphere)\n     T = change cuisine (search for a restaurant like this, but\n         serving a different kind of food) Note that with this\n         tweak, we would ideally like to know what cuisine the user\n         wanted to change to, but this information was not recorded.\n</PRE>\n\n<H4>End point</H4>\n<UL>\n   <li> Just the numeric id for the (Chicago) restaurant that the user\n     saw last.  In our experiments, we are assuming that this was a\n     good suggestion, but it is also possible that user just gives\n     up. \n</UL>\n\n\n<p>\nSome potentially useful data is missing.  In many cases, we don't know\nthe starting point because the user input a set of selection criteria\n(such as \"inexpensive traditional Mexican\") using a form submission,\nrather than starting from a known restaurant.  These queries were not\nrecorded.  This is denoted by a 0 in the entry point field.  Some\nsessions do not have a known end point.  This is marked by -1 in the\nend point field.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!  Other Relevant Information \n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2> Other Relevant Information</H2>\n<P> In addition to the user's interactions, there is also data linking the restaurant\nID with its name and features such as \"fabulous wine lists\", \"good for younger kids\", and\n\"Ethopian\" cuisine.\n\nThis data is stored by city (e.g. Atlanta, Boston, etc.) and is in the following format:\n\n<PRE>\n    restaurant id [tab] restaurant name [tab] restaurant features (3 digits ids separated by spaces)\n</PRE>\n\n\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!
