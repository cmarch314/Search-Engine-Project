{"text": "From isaacs hpcc 1 HP COM Stan Isaacs Newsgroups alt fractals Subject More on the area of the Mandelbrot Set Date 25 Feb 91 7 43 14 GMT Organization HP Corp Computing Services At the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past weekend John Ewing gave an interesting talk called Can We See the Mandlebrot Set He avoided using both the C word and the F word after the introduction to the talk It was not about either chaos or fractals but about what the M set is mathematically Anyway he discussed two results which we ve seen separately in this group in the last month or so Namely that by computing the area of the M set using lots of terms in a series Laurent Series the upper bound of the area seems to converge about at 1 72 the graph gets quite flat and seems to have an asymptote there and by counting pixals more and more accurately you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1 52 Both these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in the limit that is it is NOT the case that these numbers would get closer if a finer grid were used or more terms were taken in the series So why the difference of 1 or so No one knows One possibility is that the pixal method misses hairs around the border I know thats not described very well it was late and I wasn t taking notes There was also a vague theory for the higher number being possibly wrong But basically it is not known at present which of these numbers represents the real area although it is believed that one of them does I m afraid he didn t give references I asked

This means that the average itself almost certainly varys even less from the true area For 2 samples the standard error of the mean is about 23 of the standard deviation A safe estimate of the error would be about 1 3 of the standard deiation My old estimate from April 13th 1993 was 1 5 6595 2 That estimate was based on an average of 4 runs and used a dwell limit of 524288 I should have subtracted 5 to account for the error in using such a low dwell limit I also was a little too liberal in my calculation of the expected error Robert Munafo From edgar math ohio state edu G A Edgar

There was some discussion a while back about the area of the Mandelbrot set I just noticed the following article J H Ewing and G Schober The area of the Mandelbrot set Numer Math 61 1992 59 72 It may be of interest Jeff Shallit shallit graceland waterloo edu From edgar math ohio state edu G A Edgar The article computes the area estimate using 24 terms The result is 1 7274 The behovior of the approximations suggests that the limit is between 1 66 and 1 71 However the estimates of the area from below using pixel counting show that the area is at least 1 52 The large gap between the lower bound 1 52 and the upper bound 1 71 may possibly be an indication that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has positive area The Ewing and Schober paper cited also explains the computation of the

each period p count around the Cardioid Let s name the buds i p the i th bud with period p n for p 1 to inf do for i 1 to p do n n 1 But we find we already counted some For example 2 4 is the same bud as 1 2 The modified loop is n m for p 1 to inf do for i 1 to p do if gcd i p 1 then n n 1 else m m 1 where m will count the duplicates To count the buds on buds we must make this algorithm recursive When we are done we can also count the island Mandelbroties l They will be l 2 p n m Mandelbrotie buds Table I shows the results of this calculation We can also keep a running total of the number of buds The total for each doubling of the period is shown in Table II The last column shows the ratio of the total with each doubling which approaches 5 56 An approximate formula for the total is Total buds T 5 56 ln2 p 2 5 56 1 1 442695 ln p exp 2 46 ln p 1 7 The density of buds is approximately dT dp 45 p exp 2 46 ln p Now if we use Milnor s bud radius formula r sin pi i p p p we can estimate the area of the Cardioid plus attached buds The formula is not good for buds on buds however if I use it anyway the area approaches 1 5 7818 I must point out the formula is quite inaccurate with error as large as 1 Therefore measured radii for p less than 11 were substituted in the revised area estimate Table III which approaches 1 5 41 6 This is approximate since the bud radii area for periods beyond 2 are still unknown The importance of the bud area as a function of p can be gauged the total area of all buds and cardioids as a function of p An estimate based on pixel counting is shown in Table IV The values for p 1 2 can be compared to the exact values A 1 3 pi 8 1 178 97245 calculated 1 178 9694 A 2 pi 16 196349541 calculated 19634926 Their error is about 3e 7 The calculation used 8192x4 96 samples in region 2 1 125 5 1 125 with an iteration limit of 83886 8 Period detection was used for early exit When a period was found an additional set of iterations were used with a fuzzy period test to distinguish the real period from a multiple A simultaneous graphic display showed the errors in the period selection to be very few The undecideds after 83886 8 iterations were counted Only 73 samples out of 8987185 were unable to decide to exit or find a period We can see from Table IV that accurate estimates of bud radii will be needed up to p 48 if we want 5 or 6 digit accuracy That is

6 Organization Deja News The Leader in Internet Discussion Recently I restarted the computing effort I undertook about a year ago to compute the area of the Mandelbrot Set After reviewing the notes from that time I saw that there had been some interest in the past of computing the Mandelbrot Set s center of gravity as well I have also done some optimizations of the code in the mean time and fixed a few bugs and have started doing a long run The method I use involves counting pixels on a grid There is error in the estimate resulting from grid placement and the fact that the grid squares on the boundary get counted as completely in or completely out when in fact only part of their area is in It is hard to estimate the magnitude of this error so I use statistical methods to measure it I use a bunch of grids of slightly different grid spacings with slight vertical and horizontal offsets and take the mean and standard deviation of all the runs These are the figures I ve compiled so far Each run is the average of 2 grids for which the standard deviations are shown grid iter area and standard iterations size limit center of deviations time seconds gravity 2 runs performance MFLOPs

error of the mean is 1 sqrt 19 of the standard deviation this is called the standard error of the mean I use 1 3 as a conservative estimate So my best estimate of the center of gravity is 28676832 1 For the area we have 1 5 659173 2 The Inverse Symbolic Calculator is a resource at the URL http www cecm sfu ca projects ISC ISCmain html which can be used to guess what expression produces a given numeric value I plugged in the values 1 5 659173 and 28676832 I saw nothing interesting for the area but for the center of gravity it gives ln 3 1 3 Feig1 Feig1 is the larger Faigenbaum constant whose value is 4 6692 16 91 299 6718532 38 and shows up in the Mandelbrot Set as the ratio of the radii of successive mu atoms on the real axis Plugging in this value we get the following hypothetical precise value of the Mandelbrot Set s center of gravity 286768263382935 268529586 A few other observations My program currently runs at about 2 39 million Mandelbrot iterations per second each iteration requires 7 floating point operations The latest model Macs are about 4 times faster Intel machines get nowhere close because they don t have enough floating point registers to keep the pipeline full Each time I double the grid size it takes almost 4 7 times as long The current rate of progress in computer performance is about 1 56 per year at that rate it takes about 3 5 years to increase computing power by 4 7 Each time the gridsize is doubled the error goes down to about 4 of the previous value but it varies from 3 to 55 It would take about 8 to 1 years for personal computers to improve enough to give us one more digit in the area estimate given the same run time Robert Munafo Malden Massachusetts 4 March 1998 rpm mrob uucp spdcc com", "_id":

&amp; Services\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nAt the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past\nweekend, John Ewing gave an interesting talk called \"Can We See the\nMandlebrot Set\".  (He avoided using both the \"C\" word and the \"F\" word\nafter the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or\nfractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he\ndiscussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the\nlast month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set\nusing lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of\nthe area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,\nand seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and\nmore accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.\nBoth these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in\nthe limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get\ncloser if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the\nseries.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One\npossibility is that the pixal method misses \"hairs\" around the border.\n(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't\ntaking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number\nbeing possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,\nwhich of these numbers represents the \"real\" area (although it is\nbelieved that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references\n(I asked afterwards.)\n\n  -- Stan Isaacs\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:jasonp@wam.umd.edu\">jasonp@wam.umd.edu</A> (Jason Stratos Papadopoulos)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: centroid of the Mandelbrot's set\n<B>Date:</B>           19 Jun 1996 15:52:41 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Maryland College Park\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nZdislav V.

Gerald Edgar posted an area estimate based on\n72 terms.  Yuval Fisher pointed out that a 256-term estimate gives a\nmuch lower value, and he described how to compute coefficients in the area\nseries.\n\nUsing Yuval's suggestion, I computed over 100,000 terms of the series.\nThe estimate converges very slowly -- a summary appears below.  An\ninportant point is that every truncation of the series is an \n*upper bound* on the area of M.

(He avoided using both the \"C\" word and the \"F\" word\nafter the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or\nfractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he\ndiscussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the\nlast month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set\nusing lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of\nthe area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,\nand seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and\nmore accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.\nBoth these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in\nthe limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get\ncloser if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the\nseries.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One\npossibility is that the pixal method misses \"hairs\" around the border.\n(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't\ntaking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number\nbeing possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,\nwhich of these numbers represents the \"real\" area (although it is\nbelieved that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references\n(I asked afterwards.)\n\n  -- Stan Isaacs\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:shallit@graceland.waterloo.edu\">shallit@graceland.waterloo.edu</A> (Jeffrey Shallit)\n<B>Subject:</B>        area of the Mandelbrot set\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Waterloo\n<B>Date:</B>           Tue, 10 Mar 1992 14:52:52 GMT\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nThere was some discussion a while back about the area of the\nMandelbrot set.

We can for each period, p, count around\nthe Cardioid.  Let's name the buds (i,p), the i-th bud with\nperiod p.\n\nn:=0;\nfor p:=1 to inf do\n  for i:=1 to p do\n    n:=n+1;\n\nBut we find we already counted some. For example, (2,4) is\nthe same bud as (1,2).  The modified loop is\n\nn:=0; m:=0;\nfor p:=1 to inf do\n  for i:=1 to p do\n    if gcd(i,p)=1 then\n      n:=n+1\n    else\n      m:=m+1;\n\nwhere m will count the duplicates. To count the buds on buds,\nwe must make this algorithm recursive. When we are done, we\ncan also count the island Mandelbroties, l. They will be\n\nl = 2^p - (n+m) - Mandelbrotie buds.\n\nTable I shows the results of this calculation.  We can also\nkeep a running total of the number of buds.  The total for\neach doubling of the period is shown in Table II.  The last\ncolumn shows the ratio of the total with each doubling which\napproaches 5.56.  An approximate formula for the total is\n\n  Total buds, T = 5.56^(ln2(p/2)) = 5.56^(-1+1.442695*ln(p))\n                = exp( 2.46*ln(p)-1.7 )\n\nThe density of buds is approximately\n\n  dT/dp = (0.45/p)*exp( 2.46*ln(p) )\n\nNow if we use Milnor's bud radius formula r=sin(pi*i/p)/(p*p),\nwe can estimate the area of the Cardioid plus attached buds.\nThe formula is not good for buds on buds, however if I use it\nanyway, the area approaches 1.507818.  I must point out the\nformula is quite inaccurate, with error as large as 100%.\nTherefore, measured radii for p less than 11 were substituted\nin the revised area estimate, Table III, which approaches\n1.504106.  This is approximate since the bud radii (area) for\nperiods beyond 2 are still unknown.\n\nThe importance of the bud area as a function of p can be\ngauged the total area of all buds and cardioids as a function\nof p.  An estimate based on 'pixel counting' is shown in Table\nIV.  The values for p=1,2 can be compared to the exact values.\n\nA(1) = 3*pi/8 = 1.178097245 (calculated=1.17809694),\n\nA(2) =  pi/16 = 0.196349541 (calculated=0.19634926).\n\nTheir error is about 3e-7.  The calculation used 8192x4096\nsamples in region (-2,-1.125),(0.5,1.125) with an iteration\nlimit of 8388608.  Period detection was used for early exit.\nWhen a period was found, an additional set of iterations were\nused with a fuzzy period test to distinguish the real period\nfrom a multiple.  A simultaneous graphic display showed the\nerrors in the period selection to be very few.  The undecideds\nafter 8388608 iterations were counted.  Only 73 samples out\nof 8987185 were unable to decide to exit or find a period.\nWe can see from Table IV that accurate estimates of bud radii\nwill be needed up to p=48 if we want 5 or 6 digit accuracy.\nThat is 2417 buds on the main Mandelbrot, not an impossible\ntask.  8^)   |-0   &gt;^]   |-(  (Are we having fun yet?)  ;^)\n\n                  Table I\n\nPeriod  Buds

Mandelbrot Set center-of-gravity is -((ln(3)-1/3)^Feig)\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 04 Mar 1998 14:36:24 -0600\n<B>Organization:</B>   Deja News - The Leader in Internet Discussion\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nRecently I restarted the computing effort I undertook\nabout a year ago to\ncompute the area of the Mandelbrot\nSet. After reviewing the notes from that\ntime I saw that there had\nbeen some interest in the past of computing the\nMandelbrot Set's\n\"center of gravity\" as well. I have also done some\noptimizations of\nthe code in the mean time and fixed a few bugs, and have\nstarted\ndoing a long run.\n\nThe method I use involves counting pixels on a\ngrid. There is error\nin the estimate resulting from grid placement and the\nfact that the\ngrid squares on the boundary get counted as completely in or\ncompletely out when in fact only part of their area is in. It is hard\nto\nestimate the magnitude of this error, so I use statistical methods\nto measure\nit. I use a bunch of grids of slightly different grid\nspacings with slight\nvertical and horizontal offsets, and take the\nmean and standard deviation of\nall the runs.\n\nThese are the figures I've compiled so far. Each run is the\naverage\nof 20 grids for which the standard deviations are shown.\n\n  grid \niter  area and  standard  iterations\n  size  limit  center-of-       deviations \ntime (seconds)\n  gravity  (20 runs)  performance (MFLOPs)\n\n  256  65536 \n1.506 38  0.002 31  18,623,118\n  -0.286 741  0.000 912 9.4  13.918\n\n  512 \n131072  1.506 87  0.001 35  82,659,183\n  -0.286 881  0.000 417 40.2  14.376\n\n  1024  262144  1.506 782  0.000 493  372,533,718\n  -0.286 802    0.000 173 \n176  14.839\n\n  2048  524288  1.506 674       0.000 151  1,716,452,044\n  -0.286 811\n0  0.000 074 8  788  15.246\n\n  4096  1048576  1.506 584 0  0.000 074 4 \n7,933,339,783\n        -0.286 765 8  0.000 024 8  3,580  15.502\n\n  8192  2097152 \n1.506 593 6  0.000 027 7  36,987,339,092\n  -0.286 769 51  0.000 009 73 \n16,300  15.852\n\n 16384  4194304  1.506 588 1  0.000 012 7  171,493,547,507\n \n-0.286 767 27  0.000 003 20  74,400  16.138\n\n 32768  8388608  1.506 591 50 \n0.000 004 51  814,136,316,927\n        -0.286 768 37  0.000 001 77  347,000  16.442\n\n 65536 16777216  1.506 592 31  0.000 001 90  3,844,750,451,387\n  -0.286 768\n423  0.000 000 510  1,630,000  16.529\n\n131072 33554432 1.506 591 734  0.000\n000 624  18,173,551,931,685\n  -0.286 768 317  0.000 000 295  7,590,000 \n16.754\n\nFor each average, the standard deviation gives the expected error\nin\neach of the 20 individual grids. The expected error of the mean\nis 1/sqrt(19)\nof the standard deviation (this is called \"the standard\nerror of the mean\").\nI use 1/3 as a conservative estimate. So, my\nbest estimate of the\ncenter-of-gravity is -0.28676832 +- 0.00000010.\nFor the area, we have\n1.50659173 +- 0.00000020.\n\nThe Inverse Symbolic Calculator is a resource at\nthe URL\n\n  <A HREF=\"http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html\">http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html</A>\n\nwhich can be\nused to guess what expression produces a given numeric\nvalue. I plugged in\nthe values 1.50659173 and 0.28676832. I saw\nnothing interesting for the area\nbut for the center of gravity it\ngives\n\n  -((ln(3)-1/3) ^ Feig1).\n\nFeig1 is\nthe larger Faigenbaum constant, whose value is\n4.6692016091029906718532038,\nand shows up in the Mandelbrot Set as\nthe ratio of the radii of successive\nmu-atoms on the real axis.\nPlugging in this value we get the following\nhypothetical precise\nvalue of the Mandelbrot Set's center of gravity:\n\n-0.2867682633829350268529586\n\nA few other observations:\n\n- My program\ncurrently runs at about 2.39 million Mandelbrot iterations\n  per second (each\niteration requires 7 floating-point operations).\n  The latest model Macs are\nabout 4 times faster. Intel machines get\n  nowhere close because they don't\nhave enough floating-point registers\n  to keep the pipeline full.\n\n- Each\ntime I double the grid size it takes almost 4.7 times as long.\n  The current\nrate of progress in computer performance is\n  about 1.56 per year; at that\nrate it takes about 3.5 years\n        to increase computing power by 4.7.\n\n- Each\ntime the gridsize is doubled the error goes down to about 0.4\n        of the\nprevious value (but it varies from 0.3 to 0.55). It would take\n  about 8 to\n10 years for personal computers to improve enough to give\n  us one more digit\nin the area estimate (given the same run time).\n\n- Robert Munafo\n  Malden\nMassachusetts\n        4 March 1998\n  <A HREF=\"mailto:rpm%mrob.uucp@spdcc.com\">rpm%mrob.uucp@spdcc.com</A>\n</PRE>\n", "id": 10895.0}
