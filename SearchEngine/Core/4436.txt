information it addresses an important user centered problem this paper presents a practical user interface to make the system useful the paper includes large scale user oriented testing that demonstrates the efficacy of the system the evaluation uses both quantitative and qualitative data to make its case I think this paper is destined to be a classic because it may eventually define how people manage their files for a decade Moreover it is well written and can serve as a good model for developers doing system design and evaluation and for students learning about IR systems and evaluation 4 Simple Proven Approaches to Text Retrieval by Robertson and Jones Commentary This paper provides a brief but well informed and technically accurate overview of the state of the art in text retrieval at least up to 1997 It introduces the ideas of terms and matching term weighting strategies relevance weighting a little on data structures and the evidence for their effectiveness In my view it does an exemplary job of introducing the terminology of IR and the main issues in text retrieval for a numerate and technically well informed audience It also has a very well chosen list of

Sivakumar A Tomkins E Upfal PODS 2 Abstract The pages and hyperlinks of the World Wide Web may be viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph This graph has about a billion nodes today several billion links and appears to grow exponentially with time There are many reasons mathematical sociological and commercial for studying the evolution of this graph We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph addressing problems from Web search automatic community discovery and classification We then recall a number of measurements and properties of the Web graph Noting that traditional random graph models do not explain these observations we propose a new family of random graph models Summaries no class 1 22Slides 41 27Web Crawling 6 How Google Code Search Worked by Russ

Engine by S Brin and L Page this link is to the long version the short version was publishied in WWW1998 Commentary This paper and the work it reports has had more impact on everyday life than any other in the IR area A major contribution of the paper is the recognition that some relevant search results are greatly more valued by searchers than others By reflecting this in their evaluation procedures Brin and Page were able to see the true value of web specific methods like anchor text The paper presents a highly efficient scalable implementation of a ranking method which now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over billions of pages at about 6 queries per second It also hints at the technology which Google users now take for granted spam rejection high speed

by latent semantic analysis by Deerwester Dumais et al Commentary IR as a field hasn t directly considered the issue of semantic knowledge representation The above paper is one of the few that does in the following way LSI is latent semantic analysis LSA applied to document retrieval LSA is actually a variant of a growing ensemble of cognitively motivated models referred to by the term semantic space LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility with human information processing across a variety of information processing tasks LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads Finally the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to have increased markedly in recent years The above paper has also made an impact outside our field For example recent work on latent semantic kernels machine learning draws heavily on LSI Summaries Slides3 5 Guest lecturer 1 3 1 Matrix decompositions and latent semantic

generation of IR work that attempts to do more than build a bag of words for information retrieval but also attempts to make some sense of the information as well Summaries Slides Slides 3 12Slides Exam no exam Academic Honesty I trust all students are honest and do not cheat Those who break my trust at any point will get an F in the course no excuses or apologies will be accepted Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the university Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or expulsion from the university So don t risk it If for some reason you can t do the homework on time or can t study for the Quiz you re better off skipping it than cheating it Do the math Students with Disability Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs Also contact the Disability Services Center at 949 824 7494 as soon as possible to

There are many reasons -- mathematical,\r\n        sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph.\r\n        We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph,\r\n        addressing problems from Web search, automatic community discovery, and\r\n        classification. We then recall a number of measurements and properties\r\n        of the Web graph. Noting that traditional random graph models do not\r\n        explain these observations, we propose a new family of random graph\r\n        models.\"</p>\r\n\r\n        <p></p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\r\n\tSummaries  \r\n      </td>\r\n      <td>*no class*\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>1/22</td>\r\n      <td><a href=\"slides/WebCrawling.pdf\">Slides</a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">4</td>\r\n      <td>1/27</td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">Web Crawling</td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\r\n\t\r\n        <p>6. \"<a href=\"http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html\">How Google Code Search Worked\r\n        </a> \" by Russ Cox (January 2012) (*)<br/>\r\n        Commentary: Google code search has been a great resource for developers, but it\r\n           has just been shut down.

Page (this link is to the long version, the short version\r\n        was publishied in WWW1998)(*) </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Commentary: \"This paper (and the work it reports) has had more\r\n        impact on everyday life than any other in the IR area. A major\r\n        contribution of the paper is the recognition that some relevant search\r\n        results are greatly more valued by searchers than others. By reflecting\r\n        this in their evaluation procedures, Brin and Page were able to see the\r\n        true value of web-specific methods like anchor text. The paper presents\r\n        a highly efficient, scalable implementation of a ranking method which\r\n        now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over\r\n        billions of pages at about 6,000 queries per second. It also hints at\r\n        the technology which Google users now take for granted: spam rejection,\r\n        high speed query-based summaries, source clustering, and\r\n        context(location)-sensitive search. IR and bibliometrics researchers\r\n        had done it all (relevance, proximity, link analysis, efficiency,\r\n        scalability, summarization, evaluation) before 1998 but this paper\r\n        showed how to make it work on the web. For any non-IR engineer\r\n        attempting to build a web-based retrieval system from scratch, this\r\n        must be the first port of call.\"</p>\r\n\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">Summaries\r\n     </td>\r\n      <td><a href=\"slides/lecture17-linkanalysis.ppt\">Slides</a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>2/26</td>\r\n      <td><a href=\"slides/chap8.pptx\">Slides</a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">9</td>\r\n      <td>3/3</td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">Matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing</td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">Textbook <a\r\n        href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html\">Chapter\r\n        18</a> : Matrix Decompositions and latent semantic indexing \r\n\r\n\t<p><a\r\n\thref=\"http://www.puffinwarellc.com/index.php/news-and-articles/articles/33-latent-semantic-analysis-tutorial.html\">\r\n\tAdditional tutorial on LSA, with code</a>\r\n\r\n        <p>11. \"<a\r\n        href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.49.7546\">Indexing\r\n        by latent semantic analysis</a>\" by (Deerwester, Dumais, et.al) (*)</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Commentary: \" IR, as a field, hasn't directly considered the issue\r\n        of semantic knowledge representation. The above paper is one of the few\r\n        that does in the following way. LSI is latent semantic analysis (LSA)\r\n        applied to document retrieval. LSA is actually a variant of a growing\r\n        ensemble of cognitively-motivated models referred to by the term\r\n        \"semantic space\". LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility\r\n        with human information processing across a variety of information\r\n        processing tasks. LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way\r\n        which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads.\r\n        Finally, the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to\r\n        have increased markedly in recent years. The above paper has also made\r\n        an impact outside our field. For example, recent work on latent\r\n        semantic kernels (machine learning) draws heavily on LSI. \"</p>\r\n\r\n        <p></p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">\r\n\t<p>Summaries</p>\r\n\t\r\n     </td>\r\n      <td><a href=\"slides/LSI.pdf\">Slides</a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>3/5</td>\r\n      <td>\r\n        Guest lecturer\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">10</td>\r\n      <td>3/10</td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">Matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing</td>\r\n      <td rowspan=\"2\">Textbook <a\r\n        href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html\">Chapter\r\n        8</a> : Evaluation in Information Retrieval\r\n\r\n       <p> 12. \"<a\r\n        href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.124.8829\">\r\n\tUnsupervised\r\n        Named-Entity Extraction from the Web: An Experimental Study</a> \"\r\n        (Etzioni, et.al.)
