We show\nhow to maintain, for any positive constant d, a set of n\npoints in R^d indexed by time such that we can perform\ninsertions or deletions at any point in the timeline in \nO(log n) amortized time. We support, for any small constant epsilon>0,\n(1+ epsilon)-approximate range reporting queries at any point in the\ntimeline in O(log n + k) time, where k is the output size.\nWe also show how to answer (1+epsilon)-approximate nearest neighbor\nqueries for any point in the past or present in O(log n) time.\nJoint work with Michael Goodrich.\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2345.0}
