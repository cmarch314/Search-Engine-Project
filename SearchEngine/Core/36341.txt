If your data are in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program,\n    they should be saved as text files and delimited by tabs, commas, or spaces. \n    Make sure that your labels (gene names) do not include whatever you choose.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Comments can be inserted anywhere in the text as long as the comment lines are prefixed by a '#' because\n    the underlying R code will ignore command lines beginning with #. Column headings must be removed unless\n    they are preficed by a # sign or specifically excluded by identifying which is data start row. \n    Do note that having the # sign in the middle of a line without prefixing the line with a # will \n    result in errors. For example, please ensure that none of the gene names (in the label column) have a\n    # in them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Missing values are coded as 'NA' (not 'na' - case matters) and values below background are coded as zero\n    (&quot;0&quot;) \n  </p> \n  <p>\n    There must be at least one label column.

The Unpaired two conditions data example file from above works as an \n    example for this type of data.\n  </p>\n  <h4>Multiple conditions data</h4>\n  <p>For this type of data, the columns for each condition should be contiguous.\n    For example with three conditions having two replicates each, columns should be in the following order: </p>\n  <pre>\n    Label, Cond1Repl1, Cond1Repl2, Cond2Repl1, Cond2Repl2, Cond3Repl1, Cond3Repl2</pre>\n  <p>\n    Again, you could have more than three conditions or more than two replicates each, but columns from the same \n    condition need to be next to one another.
