Over the last decade, data locality in\na sequential setting has been addressed in part via cache oblivious\nalgorithms.  (A cache oblivious algorithm does not know or use memory\nparameters such as block or page size, the time needed for a cache\nmiss, etc. It's virtue is simplicity. The algorithmic challenge is to\nmatch the performance of parameter aware algorithms, at least up to\nmodest constant factors. This has been achieved for many problems.)\n\nThe current work explores to what extent obliviousness may be\npossible in the multicore setting. We seek algorithms that are\noblivious to both memory parameters and to the number of cores.  We\nshow this is possible by developing oblivious algorithms for this\nsetting, including a new sorting algorithm which achieves\n(asymptotically) optimal operation and cache-miss count, and a\ncritical path length of O(log n log log n) for sorting n items.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3932.0}
