Also, fitting the resulting\ndata to dynamical models requires a flexible modeling framework for\ncoupled mechanical and regulatory networks.  For these problems we develop\na mathematical foundation based on the use of a ?dynamical grammar?\ncapable of representing discrete-time events such as cell division that\nchange the number of objects and their relationships, as well as\ncontinuous-time processes arising from regulatory networks and mechanical\ninteractions.  The resulting algorithms are being used to assist\nexperimental research on mechanisms of meristem maintenance and\nphyllotaxis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJoint work with Tigran Bacarian, Pierre Baldi, Ashish Bhan, Victoria Gor,\nMarcus Heisler, Henrik J\u00f6nsson, Elliot Meyerowitz, Venu Reddy, Alex\nSadovsky, Bruce Shapiro.
