In most practical systems, resources are\nconstrained. Although one would like to probe every\ncamera at every time instant and store every frame, this is\nsimply not feasible. Constraints arise from network bandwidth\nrestrictions, I/O and disk usage from writing images,\nand CPU usage needed to extract features from the images.\nAssume that, due to resource constraints, only a subset of\nsensors can be probed at any given time unit. This paper\nexamines the problem of selecting the \u2018\u2018best\u2019\u2019 subset of\nsensors to probe under some user-specified objective\u2014e.g.,\ndetecting as much motion as possible. With this objective,\nwe would like to probe a camera when we expect motion,\nbut would not like to waste resources on a non-active\ncamera. The main idea behind our approach is the use of\nsensor semantics to guide the scheduling of resources.\nWe learn a dynamic probabilistic model of motion correlations\nbetween cameras, and use the model to guide\nresource allocation for our sensor network. Although previous\nwork has leveraged probabilistic models for sensorscheduling,\nour work is distinct in its focus on real-time\nbuilding-monitoring using a camera network. We validate\nour approach on a sensor network of a dozen cameras\nspread throughout a university building, recording measurements\nof unscripted human activity over a two week\nperiod. We automatically learnt a semantic model of\ntypical behaviors, and show that one can significantly\nimprove efficiency of resource allocation by exploiting this\nmodel.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/VaisenbergMR_JRTIP_2010/VaisenbergMR_JRTIP_2010.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nRonen Vaisenberg, Sharad Mehrotra, and Deva Ramanan.\nSemartcam scheduler - semantics driven real-time data collection from indoor camera networks to maximize event detection.\nIn <em>Journal of Real-Time Image Processing (JRTIP)</em>. 2010.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@inproceedings{<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VaisenbergMR_JRTIP_2010,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Vaisenberg, Ronen and Mehrotra, Sharad and Ramanan, Deva\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"SEMARTCam Scheduler - Semantics Driven Real-Time Data Collection from Indoor Camera Networks to Maximize Event Detection\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2010\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"Journal of Real-Time Image Processing (JRTIP)\"<br>\n}<br>\n<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2015 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2999.0}
