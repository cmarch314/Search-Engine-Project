We will then present three variant Falcon codes that\nvia judicious use of simple cryptographic tools achieve resilience to\nadversarial corruptions yet feature very fast coding times. Each such code\noffers different performance trade-offs; for instance, one variant works well\nwith small input messages (100s of KB to 10s of MB) but the other two, by\ndesign, handle much larger messages (several GBs). Finally, we will overview\nresults from an experimental analysis of the practicality of Falcon codes, as\nwell as concrete applications in cloud and network security where these codes\ncan bring improvements, including the design of faster Proof-of-Retrievability\nschemes and the full protection of the widely-used, standardized Raptor codes,\nagainst vulnerabilities recently demonstrated by Lopes and Neves (Oakland,\n2014).
