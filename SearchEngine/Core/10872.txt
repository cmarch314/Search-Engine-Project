Box in a box Date Mon 3 Jun 1997 18 12 22 7 Remember your question from a year ago about how to place a small cube inside a unit cube so that all the unit cube s faces are touched I replied with a set of solutions in which the two cubes share a long diagonal in the smallest of these solutions the small cube s size is 3 5 that of the large one Anyway I finally went through a rather ugly proof that these are the only possible solutions The method was to express the requirements that certain small cube vertices be on the planes of the large cube s faces in terms of a system of polynomial equations use Mathematica to find all families of solutions of these equations and check that each solution either has the form I already knew about with the two cubes sharing a diagonal or doesn t

touches here means that some of its vertices lie inside the cubical faces and that the small 4 cube lies entirely inside the unit 4 cube The messy symbolic algebra methods could be set up in any dimension but get progressively harder to solve and were very difficult to solve even in 3d So those methods would theoretically work but it might be very hard to carry them out in practice My 4d visualization isn t good enough for me to guess what the right solution is either which helped a lot in the 3d case Yes same here But the 4d case is perhaps more symmetric since you have 8 cubical faces and 16 vertices and for a 4d cube there is a very clear meaning to every other vertex But I don t think you can get an optimality argument from this symmetry Thank you for your remarks and

makes it very easy The convex hull of every other vertex is a 16 cell 4 dimensional analogue of an octahedron You can also get a 16 cell by taking the center point of every face of the cube So probably the correct answer is to inscribe the small cube so that every other vertex is at the center of a face of the large cube This is still guesswork I haven t even verified that the other faces of the small cube stay inside the large cube David Eppstein UC Irvine Dept of Information Computer Science eppstein ics uci edu http www ics uci edu eppstein From David Eppstein eppstein ics uci edu

the small cube at the face centers of the large cube works and that it is optimal Since each opposite pair of vertices of the small cube form a diameter of the small cube perpendicular to the large cube s faces there is no way to get a pair of vertices touching parallel planes farther apart than the large cube s faces and for similar reasons the other 8 vertices of the small cube can t touch or

inscribed cubes together with the cube 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 itself form a very nice complex of three cubes in which each pair of two cubes shares the eight vertices of a 16 cell The whole set of 24
