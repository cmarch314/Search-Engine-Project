development technology the human factors of software development and advanced program editing systems The New Age of Technical Collaboration in the Enterprise Steve Reynolds Director of Product Management StarBase sreynolds starbase com The enterprise development environment is changing in several significant ways due primarily to two factors The first factor is that development resources are becoming more and more distributed As a direct result of the Internet and the scarcity of key development resources the ability to communicate with and coordinate geographically dispersed project resources is a key development requirement The second factor is that the contributors to the development effort have increasingly diverse backgrounds not all of which are technical For example the advent of web development has directly involved sales and marketing in the development effort but these team members are often overwhelmed by the technical complexity of most Software Configuration Management products Until development tools that address these factors are deployed in the enterprise true technical collaboration will not occur StarTeam 3 which will be demonstrated during this presentation was designed to address these factors and promote enterprise wide technical collaboration Biography As one of founders of StarBase Steve has been involved in the design development and marketing of tools for technical collaboration for over five years Starting with the Windows based Versions product Steve was directly involved in the design and development of StarTeam a software configuration management tool that combines version control change management and knowledge sharing With the latest release StarTeam provides web browser interfaces Java based class interfaces and
