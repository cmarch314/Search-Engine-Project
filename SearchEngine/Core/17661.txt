Thus, the submissions cannot include\nauthor names, institutions or hints based on references to prior\nwork. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference\nand discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending\nsomeone else's research. We realize that for some papers it will still\nreveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these\nguidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Authors must\nidentify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external\nreview committee members, as defined <a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm\" target=\"text\">\nhere</a> (ACM SIGPLAN policy).\n</p>\n\n<!---\n<p><b>\nPoster submission:\n</b></p>\n<p>\nPoster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but\nmay not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not\naccepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered\nfor posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the\nposter session should indicate this in their abstract\nsubmission. Two-page summaries of posters will be included in the\nconference proceedings.\n--->\n\n<p><b>\nSubmission site: click  <a href=\"https://www.softconf.com/d/ppopp2013/\" target=\"text\">here</a>\n</b></p>\n<p>\n<font size=\"3\" color=\"red\">No extension for full paper submission.</font>\n</p>\n\n<!--\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.softconf.com/c/ppopp2012/\" target=\"text\">https://www.softconf.com/c/ppopp2012/</a>\n</p>\n--->\n\n</body> \n</html> \n \n", "id": 17661.0}
