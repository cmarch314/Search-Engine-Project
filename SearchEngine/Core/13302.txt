We show how to draw any st-planar\nlearning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the\nbottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and\none maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an\n$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these\ngraphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"Epp-GD-06-talk.pdf\">GD'06 talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Learning sequences</b>.<br>\nD.
