Given an undirected graph embedded on an orientable surface of genus g, our algorithm computes the minimum cut in g^{O(g)}*nloglogn time, matching the running time of the fastest algorithm known for planar graphs, due to .a .cki and Sankowski, for any constant g.\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3882.0}
