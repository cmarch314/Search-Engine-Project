The overall grade\nwill be determined 20% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and\n30% from the final.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted, but each\nstudent must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.\nIf a student turns in a solution without listing\nthe others who helped produce this solution,\nthis act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Exam policy.</b>\nExam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration\nis allowed on exams.
