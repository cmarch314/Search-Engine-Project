there a typo here Apparently so Try we will use a more complete anonymous 22 February 2 1 2 55 It is slightly disappointing that SVMs have been removed from the syllabus If possible it would be fun to have these kept on Hi I don t know that they will be removed but schedule hit enough flux that I just moved everything down to try to reorganize I still hope to talk a bit about SVMs but they probably won t make it into a homework Daniel Hebert 4 February 2 1 14 6 I may have missed whenever it was explained in class but what is the nature of Bonus1 as regards grades extra credit Is it purely optional to increase our grades And what is the approx value of it compared to other hw I have a very busy weekend week ahead of me and would like to better evaluate how much effort to put into Bonus1 Thanks Daniel Hebert Bonus homework values are directly added to your homework score so they can replace points lost on earlier or later homeworks or fill in to proportionally lesser value for points on the midterm or final exam oleksii 2 February 2 1 15 51 Slides from discussion section 3 Attach DS3 pdf ihler 28 January 2 1 11 23 For Bonus HW 3 I apparently have a typo in the linear regression classifier function simply transpose each usage of Xtrain and hopefully that will fix the problem I will update the homework itself when I get a chance oleksii 28 January 2 1 11 23 I am in my office on Mondays any time and Tuesdays 1 pm 6 pm You can stop by any time but it would be good if you can email me in advance if you plan to stop by My office is ICS468B Other than Mondays and Tuesdays I am available via email only oleksii 28 January 2 1 11 18 Slides from discussion section 1 Attach DS1 pdf However for introduction to Matlab I would encourage to have a look at the links posted on the class website Discussion section 2 didn t have any slides because I was showing the demonstration in matalb anonymous 27 January 2 1 14 14 It would be great if after the midterm the homework could return to being due on Wednesday Yes I would prefer that as well and will aim to do so However you can always finish the homework on Wednesday and turn it in any additional time such as with HW3 should only be helpful James 27 January 2 1 11 5 Thanks for answering my question to Homework 1 A WEEK AFTER THE ASSIGNMENT WAS DUE Perhaps you re not reloading the page according to the wiki history your HW1 question was answered on 1 14 the day after it was written And we re STILL waiting for the TA to post his slides on this site I ll ask him to take care of this but in the future it might be effective to simply ask again nicely by email anonymous 25 January 2 1 12 44 Thank you for giving us a second chance at hmw2 I just finished the additional problem and it was EXTREMELY helpful Great I m glad to hear it was useful James 13 January 2 1 13 44 Problem 1 on the homework is a problem I can t seem to sync the green and blue plots to the original data I m using the command plot X 1 2 k to plot the original data The command plot X find Y ro highlights the data correctly but the command plot X find Y 1 gt does not highlight the data correctly It s offset by 5 I m stumped What am I doing wrong You need to specify both x y coordinates e g plot X find Y 1 1 X find Y 1 2 gt You should be doing this for the other examples as well If you look at size X find Y 1 you ll see it is not Nx2 but just 1xN or so James 13 January 2 1 12 8 Will the TA post his slides on the web page Oleksii TA 11 January 2 1 11 53 If you have questions or topics which you want to be discussed during the
