You'll find that you're much better off with clear project names, so you can find them as you start to accumulate a large number of them.  (If you mix the code examples with your project work, you might want to prefix all of the example projects with a word like <b>Example</b>, so you can tell the examples apart from your own work at a glance.)</li>\n  <li>Download and unzip the example somewhere temporarily.</li>\n  <li>Copy the <b>src</b> folder into the new project's folder within your workspace folder, replacing the old (empty) <b>src</b> folder.</li>\n  <li>Right-click the project in Project Explorer in Eclipse and select Refresh.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After taking these steps, the example should be available in Eclipse!</p>\n\n<p>Note that Eclipse will collapse a large comment that I've written at the top of each .java file, so that you can only see the first line of it.  You'll want to be sure to expand these comments (by clicking the little + next to them) and read them, because that's where a lot of the useful information is.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 16751.0}
