This means that the Applets can act as \nclients in the user's environment dispite the fact that they actually can\nonly act through the Chimera website.  </p>\n\n<p><b>Note</b>:  At this time, the Applet Server automatically comes up \nwhen the Hyperweb Manager is started.  The Applet Server will automatically \nstart whenever it is deactivated by the <b>Quit</b> command in the\n<b>File</b> menu, and there is a Hyperweb Manager running at\nthe Chimera website.  </p>\n\n<p><b>Note</b>:  An Applet Server is started for each user using a \nChimera enabled applet.  </p>\n\n<H3>User-Interface</H3>\n\n<p> The Applet Server's user-interface is contained within a \nwindow that allows its status to be visible.
