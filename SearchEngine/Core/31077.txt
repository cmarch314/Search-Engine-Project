{"text": "Local Site MapOverviewViewersObjectsViewsAnchorsLinksAttributesClientsHyperwebs Clients Clients play an integral role in the Chimera architecture They provide users access to Chimera s hypermedia services While clients typically contain only one viewer Chimera places no restrictions on the number of viewers a client can contain This strict separation between the notion of client and the notion of viewer allows Chimera to efficiently model a wide variety of application architectures ranging from single threaded single purpose clients to multi threaded commercial applications The responsibilities of a client are distinct from the responsibilities of a viewer These responsibilities are Establishing and maintaining a connection with the Chimera server This includes notifying viewers of changes in the state of the connection Activating viewers as appropriate in response to a user s actions For instance requesting a chart be generated from a range of spreadsheet data will necessitate the invocation of a chart viewer Routing hypermedia events to the appropriate viewer Hypermedia events arrive from the Chimera server tagged for a particular viewer It is the client s responsibility to see that the event is delivered to the correct viewer Developer Information The operations used by clients are listed below The type concept used in some of the operations below indicates that these operations are available on all of the previous hypermedia concepts viewers objects views anchors and links For more information see the on line documentation connect String Establishes a connection to a Chimera server The string specifies the name of the client The name of the client is currently unused by the system It is here to serve as a placeholder for potential future use by the system In particular since clients can contain multiple viewers it must be possible to map viewer names to their associated client name in order to invoke the appropriate client during a delayed link traversal connectApplet String String String Establishes a connection to a Chimera server in the case where the client is a Java applet Due to the security restrictions on applets additional information is required In particular the first string specifies the name of the host from which the applet was downloaded the second string specifies the name of the applet s user which the applet may have to query its user for while the third string specifies the name of the client as before connectHyperwebManager String Once you are connected to a Chimera server the viewer needs to connect to a Chimera 2 website in order to access Chimera 2 hyperwebs This routine connects the Chimera server to the website specified by a URL passed as a string to this routine Note all of a user s clients share the same Chimera server thus this routine determines which site is accessed by all of a user s clients Thus this operation will generate an activeSite event to all of the user s other clients informing them of the change disconnect Disconnects the client from its Chimera server disconnectHyperwebManager Disconnects the Chimera server from its currently active Chimera 2 website This will generate an activeSite event to all of the user s other clients informing them of the change clearWeb Deselects the currently active hyperweb All of the user s other clients will be informed of the change via an activeWeb event getWeb Returns the name of the currently active hyperweb getWebs Returns the names of the available hyperwebs for the active Chimera 2 website These names can then be used to select hyperwebs for manipulation via the setWeb operation isHwmConnected Returns TRUE if the client is connected to a Chimera 2 website lockConcept concept A client must lock a concept before performing an operation which would change its state This prevents two different clients from modifying the concept at the same time This operation is non blocking It will either lock the concept and return TRUE or it will return FALSE If the latter the client must enter a polling loop to determine when the concept is available for locking The inadequacy of this locking mechanism is well known by its developers This mechanism is one of the primary targets for improvement in the Chimera 2 beta release locked concept Returns TRUE if the specified concept is locked setWeb String
