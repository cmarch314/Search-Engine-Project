The dimensionality of the data for these applications ranges\r\nfrom low to high. Most existing methods have focused on the execution of high-dimensional\r\njoins over large amounts of disk-based data. The increasing sizes of\r\nmain memory available on current computers, and the need for efficient processing\r\nof spatial joins suggest that spatial joins for a large class of problems can be processed\r\nin main memory. In this paper, we develop two new in-memory spatial join\r\nalgorithms, the Grid-join and EGO*-join, and study their performance. Through\r\nevaluation, we explore the domain of applicability of each approach and provide\r\nrecommendations for the choice of a join algorithm depending upon the dimensionality\r\nof the data as well as the expected selectivity of the join. We show that the\r\ntwo new proposed join techniques substantially outperform the state of the art join\r\nalgorithm, the EGO-join.  \r\n</p> \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<p> <H3>Keywords:</H3>  \r\nefficient similarity join, \r\nepsilon join, \r\nmulti-dimensional join, \r\nspatial join, \r\nhigh-dimensional join, \r\nselectivity, \r\ngrid join, \r\nmain memory join, \r\nfast join\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<p> <H3>Remarks:</H3>\r\nOne of the algorithms covered in the paper, called EGO*-join,\r\nis so <B>simple</B>, that it can be implemented from scratch\r\nliterally in one day. The paper demonstrates that that algorithm\r\nalso outperforms the state of the art, when applied to high-dimensional data. \r\nThus, EGO*-join is a good choice for an in-memory join algorithm in general, \r\nand, due to its simplicity, it is also a good choice for a <B>baseline</B> \r\njoin algorithm.  \r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3> \r\n\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/IS07_dvk_join.pdf\">IS07_dvk_join.pdf</A><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?IS07_dvk_join\" width=1 height=1> \r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@article{IS07::dvkJ,\r\n   author    = {Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Sunil Prabhakar},\r\n   title     = {Fast similarity join for multi-dimensional data},\r\n   journal   = IS,\r\n   volume    = 32,\r\n   number    = 1,\r\n   pages     = {160--177},\r\n   month     = mar,    \r\n   year      = 2007\r\n}\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage</A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR> \r\n</html>", "id": 4870.0}
