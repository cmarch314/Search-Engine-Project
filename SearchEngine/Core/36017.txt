However, we cannot conclude that\n    the gene is differentially expressed between the heart and the lung.  To make this determination, \n    we must use pairwise post-hoc tests.\n    In essence, post-hoc tests examine differences across all pairs of conditions.\n    Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (TukeyHSD) and Scheffe's Method are available \n    as post-hoc test options.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Note: the pairwise post-hoc p-values are <strong>not</strong> corrected for multiple testing.  \n    One should only examine pairwise post-hoc p-values for those measurements that are significant \n    (after multiple testing correction) at the ANOVA level.\n    Following this step-wise procedure should provide sufficient protection against Type I errors due \n    to multiplicity.\n    Low pairwise post-hoc p-values on their own are <strong>not</strong> indicitave of significant \n    differential behavior.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n", "id": 36017.0}
