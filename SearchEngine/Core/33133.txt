Some overhead transparencies will be provided to\neach team or teams can bring a disk with PowerPoint Slides for\nprojection from the instructor's laptop.  Transparencies may be hand\nwritten if neatly done. Transparencies should be turned in after the\npresentation. Grading is both on the content and the quality of the presentation.</P>\n\n<H4>Purpose and Content</H4>\n\n<P>The purpose of this exercise is to convince your client that you\ncan effectively complete the project they have\ndescribed. Effectiveness means that you can elicit further\nrequirements from them and reach a mutual agreement.  The project bid\nshould convince the hearers (primarily me) that your team has a good\nunderstanding of the problem, are anticipating questions to elicit\nfurther requirements from the client, have a rough idea of the process\nor lifecycle you will follow (remember process and lifecycle diagrams\nfrom ICS 121), have an idea of how you will test the project (perhaps\nan &quot;acceptance test&quot; or initial ideas about it), have an\nidea of the kinds of technology you will employ, and, finally, that\nyour team members provide a sufficient mix of skills and\nexperience.</P>\n\n<H4>Comments</H4>\n\n<P>Projects often begin vaguely. Clients do not have complete ideas about\nthe work that should be done. They may not fully anticipate their needs.\nTherefore your project bid will not be exact. You will have to guess about\nsome aspects of the project. You will have to struggle with ambiguities\nand uncertainties. The point however is to demonstrate that you have tried\nto understand the problem as best as possible and have begun to think about\nthe entire project lifecycle.</P>\n\n<P>You should already have contacted the potential client. I will ask about\nthis at the presentation.  Remember, it is best to select one person from the\nteam to coordinate with the (potential) client.</P>\n\n<P>You might think back to ICS 121 Assignment 3 (depdending on your\ninstructor) Lifecycle Considerations and Validation. </P>\n\n<P>\n<HR ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics125-FQ01/assignments/\">ICS125\nFQ01 Assignments<BR>\n</A><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics125-FQ01/\">ICS125\nFQ01<BR>\n</A><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
