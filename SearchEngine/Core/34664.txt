I don't want to say that just because existing\nversion control products use this terminology then the web based versioning\nmust as well.  But at least _I_ would like to be understood.\n\nMany products on the market are derived from RCS or SCCS (or are in fact\nRCS or SCCS), and share their terminology.  I'm adding our own product\n(Perforce) because its terminology is a superset of the others.\n\nJust to get going, here are the states a VC client can be in w.r.t. a \nfile/document, and who supports those states:\n\n\tA)\tDoesn't have the document in its possesion.\n\n\t\to   ClearCase doesn't state A, because with its virtual\n\t\t    filesystem clients are already soaking the filespace of\n\t\t    the repository.\n\n\tB)\tHas the document, but not the permission to change it.\n\n\t\to   CVS has no state B, because if you have a file you can \n\t\t    change it.\n\n\tC)\tHas the document, with the permission to change it.\n\n\t\to   RCS and SCCS have no state C -- if you have permission\n\t\t    to change a file, you also have the exclusive lock on it\n\t\t    (state D).\n\n\tD)\tHas the document, the permission to change it, and the\n\t\tlock on the copy in the repository.  This client has the\n\t\tright of way to create the next revision in the repository.\n\n\t\to   CVS has no state D, because it doesn't support exclusive\n\t\t    locks.\n\nThe transitions:\n\n\tA-&gt;B\tClearCase:\tnone (no state A)\n\t\tCVS:\t\tnone (no state B)\n\t\tRCS:\t\t\"unreserved checkout\" \n\t\tSCCS:\t\t\"get\"\n\t\tPerforce:\t\"get\"\n\n\tB-&gt;C\tClearCase:\t\"unreserved checkout\".\n\t\tCVS:\t\tnone (no state B)\n\t\tRCS:\t\tnone (no state C)\n\t\tSCCS:\t\tnone (no state C)\n\t\tPerforce:\t\"edit\"\n\n\tA-&gt;C\tClearCase:\tnone (no state A)\n\t\tCVS:\t\t\"checkout\"\n\t\tRCS:\t\tnone (no state C)\n\t\tSCCS:\t\tnone (no state C)\n\t\tPerforce:\t\"get\" + \"edit\"\n\n\tC-&gt;D\tClearCase:\t\"reserved checkout\"\n\t\tCVS:\t\tnone (no state D)\n\t\tRCS:\t\tnone (no state C)\n\t\tSCCS:\t\tnone (no state C)\n\t\tPerforce:\t\"lock\"\n\n\tB-&gt;D\tClearCase:\t\"reserved checkout\"\n\t\tCVS:\t\tnone (no state D)\n\t    \tRCS:\t\t\"reserved checkout\" \n\t\tSCCS:\t\t\"edit\"\n\t\tPerforce:\t\"edit\" + \"lock\"\n\nAs you can see, it's a mess: ClearCase and RCS use the same term for\ntwo entirely different transitions.  Basically, the word \"checkout\" can\nmean any progression from one state to the next, depending on which \nproduct you're using.\n\nHere's what I propose, based on a seat-of-the-pants understanding of\nwhich way the terminology is going:\n\n\tA-&gt;B\tProposed:\t\"GET\" (HTTP's, mind you)\n\tB-&gt;C\tProposed:\t\"CHECKOUT\"\n\tA-&gt;C\tProposed:\t\"CHECKOUT\"\n\tC-&gt;D\tProposed:\t\"LOCK\"\n\tB-&gt;D\tProposed:\t\"CHECKOUT\" + \"LOCK\"\n\nN.B. that \"CHECKOUT\" == \"GET for EDIT\", previously used.\n\nI'm not suggesting that these are new HTTP verbs, but rather that we\nuse these terms when hashing out our other ideas.\n\nComments?\n\nChristopher\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0143.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: An attempt at taxonomy\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0141.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0146.html\">Bruce Brown: \"Re: lock/checkout/reserve/edit\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe reply:</b> <a href=\"0146.html\">Bruce Brown: \"Re: lock/checkout/reserve/edit\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "id": 34664.0}
