Conclusions</H2>\n<P>\nThis paper has outlined a new approach to the provision of hypermedia functionality to graphical user-interface applications. The TI technique is novel in the way it provides the extensions to the user-interface toolkit. Rather than using the approach of groupware toolkits, which combine user-interface and groupware services into one system, a separation-of-concerns approach is utilized allowing the user-interface toolkit to leverage the power of an open hypermedia system. This results in a maintainable, reusable, architecture that presents a low-entry barrier to use by application developers.\n</P>\n<H2>8.
