Experience has determined that\nsuch systems can learn accurate models, but that experts in areas\nwhere those models are used in decision aids are often reluctant to\ntrust them because they do not, for instance, use the same tests\nintermediate conclusions or abstractions that the experts have grown\nto trust. Or they do not use certain factors at all that experts feel\nto be relevant. Experts also want models that are stable under small\nchanges in the data being analyzed. Psychologists have discovered\nfactors that simplify the learning, understanding, and communication\nof category and process information by humans. This research seeks to\nexplore these psychological principles in light of the output of\nexisting KDD algorithms and then go on to develop and evaluate new KDD\nalgorithms that will provide output that is easy for people to learn ,\nuse, and communicate to others. With the results of this research, it\nshould be possible to make such decision aids more \"human centered\",\nso that they will be used more often and more effectively in practice.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Project Report <a href=PazzaniIDM.html>(html)</a> <a href=PazzaniIDM.doc>(word)</a>\n</ul>\n<HR>\n\n<P>\n\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pazzani\">Michael J.
