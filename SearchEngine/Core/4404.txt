to list all the conferences for which I was serving on the program committee or the organizing committee But it was too hard to keep up Let s just say lots I joined the faculty at UCI or Ape City in September 2 after working at Xerox PARC now PARC Inc Apple Research Labs a now defunct part of Apple Computer and Rank Xerox EuroPARC later part of Xerox Research Centre Europe and now gone hmm there seems to be a trend My principal research interests are in Ubiquitous Computing Computer Supported Cooperative Work Human Computer Interaction and Social Studies of Science and Technology all of which basically means that I care not only about cool technology but also about how ordinary mortals can use it and the consequences for how they live and work Click on Research above for more information and a list of current and potential projects My book Where the Action Is The Foundations of Embodied Interaction was published in 2 1 by MIT Press It is available at all good bookstores and probably quite a few bad ones Fortunately it has not yet been remaindered These days though our lives are really defined by numbers I won t tell you my social security number but I am an official European expert number E73514L and my Erdos Number is 3 Unlike some of my terribly sporty colleagues I m someone whose idea of a whole body workout is to drink standing up However I have occasionally been spotted on a bicycle or rollerblades Watch out if you see me because I m probably not in control of my direction Click the links at the top of the page to find more information about courses I m teaching my current research activities and projects and copies of my publications Other pages you can reach from here are The ever popular Microsoft Barney hack Some photos and quotes My other home
