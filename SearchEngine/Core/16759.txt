Honesty The general policies on academic misconduct as outlined in the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty apply within the Bren School A copy of this text may be found in the UCI General Catalogue Academic Honesty Policy These policies suffice for much of our work including examinations and written assignments However they do not deal explicitly with course work involving computers thus the policies must be extended to cover those cases Definition of Academic Honesty The decision as to whether a student cheated depends on the intent of an assignment the ground rules specified by the instructor and the behavior of the student Two guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has occurred Program plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent development and implementation of a program results in two or more solutions so similar that one can be converted to another by a mechanical transformation Cheating will be suspected if a student who was to complete an assignment independently cannot explain both the intricacies of his or her solution and the techniques used to generate that solution It is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating each case is important enough to be given careful individual scrutiny It is however helpful to have guidelines and precedents Here are some examples of cases which are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating Academically Honest Turning in work done alone with the help of the course s staff Submission of one assignment for a group of students if group work is explicitly permitted or required Getting or giving help on how to operate the computer or terminal Getting or giving help on how to eliminate minor syntax errors High level discussion of course material for better understanding Discussion of assignments to understand what is being asked for Not Academically Honest Turning in some else s work as your own with or without his or her knowledge Turning in a completely duplicated assignment is a flagrant offense but even copying only a portion of the assignment and turning it in as your own is considered cheating Allowing someone else to turn in your work as his or her own Several people writing one program and turning in multiple copies all represented implicitly or explicitly as individual work Using any part of some else s work without proper acknowledgement Stealing an examination or a solution from the instructor This is an extremely flagrant offense Penalties The procedures that are followed and the sanctions that may be imposed for an incident of academic dishonesty are outlined in the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty Non Bren School majors should be aware that an incident of academic dishonesty is sufficient to cause denial of a petition to change major into the Bren School Bren School majors should be aware that an incident of academic dishonesty may be sufficient to cause denial of admission into the Bren School Honors Program All students should be aware that a recorded incident of academic dishonesty may disqualify them for consideration for honors at graduation All students should also be aware that a first incident of academic dishonesty if egregious may be sufficient to cause suspension or dismissal from the University and that a second incident likely will result in such a penalty In the event that an instructor writes a letter accusing a student of academic dishonesty the student may prepare a statement giving his her side of the case for inclusion in the student s file Back to top Account Allocation GENERAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION Most computing in the Bren School is done on either UNIX based Sun workstations or on Windows based PCs These machines have various uses research departmental administration undergraduate instruction graduate instruction but all are networked together and share a common file space In particular no matter which departmental computer you use either Windows or Sun you will use the same account with the same home directory All Bren School majors receive both UNIX and Windows accounts Non major students receive accounts only if the Bren School course they are enrolled in requires an account on a particular platform There are directions for activating instructional accounts on line at Activating Instructional Accounts and in the CS 364 lab Bren School majors and other students enrolled in certain Bren School courses have access to a variety of computers in several labs These machines allow you to read and send e mail read announcements for your classes through newsgroups and complete classwork programming assignments Unless you are involved in research these computers in the instructional labs are the only machines you will be able to use If you do become involved in research with a faculty member she may decide to give you access to her machines You can check out the Lab Hour and Lab Equipment for more information Expiration Expiration dates for accounts are taken from enrollment data provided by the Registrar When an account is about to expire an automated email notice is sent In the normal course of events if you are a Bren School major your account will be automatically extended and you will never see such messages Non Bren School majors will receive these messages as their accounts are opened and closed each quarter depending on course enrollment If you continue to enroll in a Bren School course your account will reactivate automatically If the Registrar does not list you or you fail to enroll on time you will be sent one of these notices If you receive a notice in error contact helpdesk ics uci edu Quotas Your quota is the amount of disk space you are allowed to use Undergraduate students get a quota of 1 MB For information on how to check your quota please see Account Quota Please Note When contacting support please include your Bren School login and student ID number to facilitate the processing of your request Also If you change your name or student ID number you need to notify helpdesk ics uci edu Otherwise your account may be automatically locked or your quota removed because of the way the registrar s system works For general information about what support offers undergraduate students see Student Information Back to top Applying for Part Time Status You are eligible for part time status if You are working 3 or more hours a week requires documentation or have health problems or family responsibilities Please see the Registrar s policy regarding Part Time Status The form Petition for Reduced Fee Part Time Study Program can be picked up at at the Registrar s Office or academic advising office or the ICS Student Affairs Office Signed part time petitions must be

snapshot ability available for self restore Snapshots retain data for 3 days To request something be restored from backups please contact computing support Back to top Copyright Infringement It is illegal to distribute copyrighted materials such as software movies music pictures without proper authorization If a complaint of copyright infringement is reported involving a computer assigned to a Bren School student the student s account will be locked out until Bren School support personnel have a chance to investigate the allegations If copyrighted materials are found they will be removed immediately For the initial complaint first violation the Bren School Student Affairs Office SAO staff and the appropriate Associate Dean as well as the academic advisor for grad students will be notified The student will be required to meet in person with appropriate SAO staff to review applicable campus policies and to sign a statement verifying receipt and notice of such policies This signed statement will become part of the student s file For any subsequent complaints the appropriate Associate Dean academic advisor for graduate students and SAO staff will be notified The student will then be referred to the campus Director of Student Judicial Affairs for academic suspension upon 2nd violation or expulsion from the university upon 3rd violation The above statement is based upon UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POLICIES APPLYING TO CAMPUS ACTIVITIES ORGANIZATIONS AND STUDENTS UCI CAMPUS IMPLEMENTATION August 1996 APPENDIX K Computer Use Policy Reference to Section 1 2 5 which includes Violating the terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws Please see the most current UCI Copyright Information Back to top Course Repetition Students who have failed a course twice must meet with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs to get advance permission to enroll for the 3rd time Those who enroll in the course but fail to meet with the Associate Dean will be dropped from the course by end of week 1 Be aware that this course drop may impact other areas e g financial aid housing immigration status so please plan accordingly Contact the ICS SAO office to make an appointment with the Associate Dean Back to top Ethical Use of Computing Introduction As a student you are probably aware of certain ethical responsibilities you have such as honesty in doing classwork Another area in which you have important ethical responsibilities is in your use of computing resources This document describes some of these responsibilities and explains Bren School Department policy on student use of computing resources Some of these policies might be different from what you would expect so please read over and understand this document The Bren School provides for you the student a wide range of computing resources from X Terminals to PC s to large multiuser UNIX systems These machines are expensive to buy and expensive to maintain but it is our goal to provide you with the very best computing environment that we can Many users depend on these computers for doing class assignments research and for communications We are a community of computer users and like any community we can all make the best use of our resources if we establish some guidelines for how we can use them responsibly Some computing facilities such as those which hold classified data may establish expensive and complex security systems In our department we do not do this we have some security mechanisms which greatly decrease the risk that one user will accidentally interfere with another but it does not require great ingenuity to get around these mechanisms As a result we need to trust the people who use our machines The fundamental principle behind our policies is this While using the computers you should never do anything that harms another user or prevents him or her from getting work done If you have any questions about these rules or if you suspect that an account your or someone else s has been broken into please contact the Bren School Computing Support Group To do this send mail to the address helpdesk ics uci edu or go to Support s office CS346 and explain the problem Computer Accounts The Bren School has a wide range of computers available located in several different labs Some of these labs are open only to people enrolled in certain classes some are available for general drop in use Each Bren School major is given both a Windows account and a UNIX account on the Sun workstations Different courses will require different platforms to be used Non majors will be given accounts only if required for a course in which they are enrolled All Bren School computers are to be used only by Bren School students faculty and staff People outside the Bren School who wish to use computers should go see the people in the Office of Information Technology Multipurpose Science and Technology Building Building 415 2nd Floor They provide computing for non Bren School people Any computer account created for you remains the property of the Regents of the University of California You are responsible for this account and you may not allow any other person to use it The primary purpose of your account is to allow you to carry out your computing assignments and other instructional activities You may also make modest use of these resources for other purposes such as sending electronic mail to friends on campus reading the electronic bulletin boards and playing games provided that this usage does not significantly interfere with instructional use of the machines An example of how one might significantly interfere would be to tie up a computer for game playing when no other computers are free and someone else is waiting to use the computer to do an assignment If you have a game or other program you would like to make available to other users please give it to the system administrator for public installation You can contact the system administrator by sending mail to helpdesk ics uci edu You may not use the machines for commercial purposes such as preparing bills for your company or advertising products or for work related to non UCI organizations such as an off campus political or religious group More details about this are given below If you are in doubt about whether some use of the machines is allowed ask the Support Group Ethical Behavior Here is a list of some examples of activities that the department does not allow If a student makes such unethical use of Bren School computers he she will be subject to the penalties described in the Disciplinary Procedures section You may not introduce viruses worms Trojan horses password cracking or login spoofing programs on any University computer or network In fact because of the serious damage such programs can cause the Bren School faculty have adopted a policy which forbids students even to have these types of programs in their accounts or to place them onto any Bren School computer you may not store such a program on a Bren School computer even if you only wish to study it You may not try to use equipment or accounts that have not been assigned to you You may not interfere with others ability to make use of the resources For example it might be reasonable to lock a workstation if you need to leave the room for two or three minutes but it is not reasonable to lock it while you leave to buy lunch Another example would be doing something that ties up all or a significant fraction of the machine thus preventing others from receiving their fair share You may not destroy other people s work You may not spy on people that is you may not attempt to gain information from their accounts or from their external drives when there is good reason to believe that they do not wish you to obtain that information This includes both attempting to violate the protection facilities provided by the system and also taking deliberate advantage of someone else s failure to protect sensitive information on their account This works both ways faculty staff and members of Computing Support also have the responsibility to respect the privacy of the student For example it would be unethical for a faculty member or Support Group member to browse through your personal messages just out of curiosity even if they have a security level that allows them to do so we agree to respect your privacy We do however retain the right to inspect material on your account when this is necessary to investigate a suspected violation of university rules such as a cheating incident or a violation of the rules in this document You may not send mail that appears to come from someone else You may not advertise any commercial products or use your account to earn money Non commercial things like posting your used car advertisement on ics market are permitted though If for some reason you need an account that can be used for commercial purposes see the Office of Academic Computing You may not display offensive material in any publicly accessible area There are materials available on the Internet and elsewhere that some members of the Bren School community will find offensive One example is sexually explicit graphics another is political argument on such issues as abortion Bren School and the University are committed to maintaining the free and open exchange of ideas as well as a non offensive working environment Thus Bren School does not restrict the availability of potentially offensive material but Bren School does regard as unethical conduct the display of such material in any publicly accessible area including on workstation screens in public rooms and in computer labs You may not use the computers printers as copying machines For example you may not print out one hundred copies of a report instead print out one copy of the report and use a copying machine to obtain the other 99 You may not use Bren School resources to illegally distribute copyrighted material Disciplinary Procedures What happens if you violate any of these rules It depends on the seriousness of the offense but could be one or more of the following Disciplinary procedures and sanctions will be consistent with those outlined in the UCI Implementation of Interim Policies and Procedures Applying to Campus Activities Organizations and Students Part A You may have to meet with the chair of the Computing Resources Committee CRC the Dean of the Bren School or the manager of the Bren School Support Group to discuss abuse of computing resources Your account may be locked Again we recognize an obligation to respect your rights as well No student account will be locked without discussion and approval of the Dean of the Bren School or the chair of the CRC except in the case of security violations It would not be ethical for us to lock your account capriciously for example we agree not to lock it simply because you send a message to a bboard expressing disagreement with some Department policy or action For minor infractions some form of departmental services e g cleaning a lab may be requested in exchange for unlocking the account For offenses involving abusing computing resources cheating on course related work or preventing others from working on assignments your grade may be lowered in the class or you may receive a failing grade For severe offenses or repeating minor offenses you may lose access to all Bren School computing facilities for a period of time Access to computing can be denied for a limited time e g one week the remainder of the quarter an entire quarter or permanently You may be suspended or dismissed from the University In serious cases your name and a description of the violation may be reported to the police California Penal Code Section 5 2 makes certain computer abuses a crime and penalties can range up to a 1 fine and up to three years in prison Good Citizenship Your cooperation in the following areas will help us make efficient use of the computing resources and will avoid unnecessary impositions on the time of faculty staff and other students These are not the sort of things which we can expect to enforce rigidly rather we are asking your cooperation for the benefit of the whole departmental community Violations of these guidelines would not ordinarily result in any of the penalties listed above beyond number one unless they were especially flagrant or persist after faculty or staff have asked you to stop 1 Please be careful not to use the computer to annoy people for example by sending them messages which they do not wish to receive The mail system makes it rather easy to send a message to a very large group of people please be responsible in your use of this capability In particular when you reply to a message sent to a large group avoid cc ing your reply to the entire group unless it is a matter of interest to them 2 Please do not waste anything i e paper disk space CPU time people time etc Please put your old printouts in the recycling bins Acknowledgments Some of these polices are adapted from those used by the UCLA CS Department They adapted some of their polices from Columbia University and the California Institute of Technology Back to top Remote Access Computer systems maintained by the both the UCI Office of Information Technology and Bren School computing support accept connections only from systems which have ther names correctly registered in Domain Name System DNS See OIT s Limitation of Services to non registered hosts for more details on this policy For security reasons Bren School systems always reject connections from remote hosts which do not have matching forward and reverse DNS entries If you are having trouble telnet ing or ftp ing to a Bren School system while away from UCI this may be the cause of the problem Back to top University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment Effective December 14 2 4 the Office of the President issued a revised University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment and associated Procedures for Responding to Reports of Sexual Harassment They cover all members of the University community including faculty and other academic personnel staff employees students and non student or non employee participants in University programs Revisions to the policy include an updated definition of sexual harassment clarification of the University s obligation to respond promptly and effectively to reports of sexual harassment provisions for training employees and educating the University community regarding sexual harassment and a statement that the policy shall be implemented in a manner that recognizes principles of free speech and academic freedom The Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity has developed local policy and guidelines that implement the systemwide procedures and address consensual relationships These supersede the previous UCI Policy on Sexual Harassment Section 7 17 Guidelines for Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution http www policies uci edu adm procs 7 7 17 html Section 7 16 Policy on Conflicts of Interest Created by Consensual Relationships http www policies uci edu adm pols 7 16 html The University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment can be found at http www ucop edu ucophome coordrev policy

transcript and or grades every quarter A hard copy of your transcript is available free at the Registrar s Office a few weeks after the quarter ends Grades are available online at http www reg uci edu access student welcome approximately one week after finals PLEASE CHECK YOUR TRANSCRIPT CAREFULLY EACH QUARTER If there are problems investigate and correct the situation promptly as most changes must be made within one quarter Repeating Classes If you repeat a class you will not receive grade credit for it again unless it has been approved as a course you can repeat For example dance classes are not repeatable Check the catalog or the student affairs office in that unit to see if a course is repeatable Courses in which you received a C or below are repeatable to remove a deficient grade If you took a course for a grade you must repeat it for a grade For the first 16 units repeated the old grade stays on your transcript but only the new grade is computed in your grade point average Please visit the UCI General Catalogue for more information on repition of courses Graduation Graduation is not automatic You must file an application which is available on line at http www reg uci edu access student welcome If you plan to graduate applications are due by the end of the tenth week of classes ONE 1 quarter before you intend to graduate Catalogue You are responsible for knowing

However, they do not deal explicitly with course work involving computers; thus the policies must be extended to cover those cases. </p>\n<p><strong>Definition of Academic Honesty</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&#160;</strong> The decision as to whether a student cheated depends on the intent of an assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor and the behavior of the student. Two guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has occurred: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Program plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent development and implementation of a program results in two or more solutions so similar that one can be converted to another by a mechanical transformation. </li>\n<li>Cheating will be suspected if a student who was to complete an assignment independently cannot explain both the intricacies of his or her solution and the techniques used to generate that solution. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating; each case is important enough to be given careful, individual scrutiny. </p>\n<p>It is, however, helpful to have guidelines and precedents. Here are some examples of cases which are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating. </p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"> <strong><i>Academically Honest</i></strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning in work done alone with the help of the course's staff. </li>\n<li>Submission of one assignment for a group of students if group work is explicitly permitted (or required). </li>\n<li>Getting or giving help on how to operate the computer or terminal. </li>\n<li>Getting or giving help on how to eliminate minor syntax errors. </li>\n<li>High-level discussion of course material for better understanding. </li>\n<li>Discussion of assignments to understand what is being asked for. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"> <strong><i>Not Academically Honest</i></strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning in some else's work as your own (with or without his or her knowledge). Turning in a completely duplicated assignment is a flagrant offense, but even copying only a portion of the assignment and turning it in as your own is considered cheating. </li>\n<li>Allowing someone else to turn in your work as his or her own. </li>\n<li>Several people writing one program and turning in multiple copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as individual work. </li>\n<li>Using any part of some else's work without proper acknowledgement. </li>\n<li>Stealing an examination or a solution from the instructor. This is an extremely flagrant offense. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Penalties</strong> The procedures that are followed and the sanctions that may be imposed for an incident of academic dishonesty are outlined in the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty. </p>\n<p> Non-Bren School majors should be aware that an incident of academic dishonesty is sufficient to cause denial of a petition to change major into the Bren School. </p>\n<p> Bren School majors should be aware that an incident of academic dishonesty may be sufficient to cause denial of admission into the Bren School Honors Program. </p>\n<p> All students should be aware that a recorded incident of academic dishonesty may disqualify them for consideration for honors at graduation. </p>\n<p> All students should also be aware that a first incident of academic dishonesty (if egregious) may be sufficient to cause suspension or dismissal from the University and that a second incident likely will result in such a penalty. </p>\n<p> <i>In the event that an instructor writes a letter accusing a student of academic dishonesty, the student may prepare a statement giving his/her side of the case for inclusion in the student's file.</i>&#160;</p>\n<p> <a href=\"OLD_index.php#startcontent\">&#8593; Back to top</a> </p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"account_allocation\"></a> </p>\n<h4>Account Allocation</h4>\n<p><strong>GENERAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong> </p>\n<p>Most computing in the Bren School is done on either UNIX based Sun workstations or on Windows based PCs. These machines have various uses -- research, departmental administration, undergraduate instruction, graduate instruction -- but all are networked together and share a common file space. </p>\n<p>In particular, no matter which departmental computer you use, either Windows or Sun, you will use the same account with the same home directory. </p>\n<p> All Bren School majors receive both UNIX and Windows accounts. Non-major students receive accounts only if the  Bren School course they are enrolled in requires an account on a particular platform. </p>\n<p>There are directions for activating instructional accounts on-line at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7elab/students/acct_activate.php\"> Activating Instructional Accounts</a> and in the CS 364 lab. </p>\n<p> Bren School majors and other students enrolled in certain Bren School courses have access to a variety of computers in several labs. </p>\n<p>These machines allow you to: read and send e-mail, read announcements for your classes through newsgroups, and complete classwork programming assignments. </p>\n<p>Unless you are involved in research, these computers in the instructional labs are the only machines you will be able to use. </p>\n<p>If you do become involved in research with a faculty member she may decide to give you access to her machines. </p>\n<p>You can check out the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7elab/lab_schedule/index.php\">Lab Hour</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7elab/labs_specs/index.php\">Lab Equipment</a> for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Expiration</strong> - Expiration dates for accounts are taken from enrollment data provided by the Registrar. When an account is about to expire, an automated email notice is sent. <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                  In the normal course of events, if you are a Bren School major your account will be automatically extended and you will never see such messages. <br/>\n                  <br/>\n                  Non-Bren School majors will receive these messages as their accounts are opened and closed each quarter depending on course enrollment. If you continue to enroll in a Bren School course, your account will reactivate automatically.<br/>\n                  <br/>\n                  If the Registrar does not list you, or you fail to enroll on time, you will be sent one of these notices. If you receive a notice in error, contact <a href=\"mailto:helpdesk@ics.uci.edu\"> helpdesk@ics.uci.edu</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quotas</strong> - Your quota is the amount of disk space you are allowed to use. <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                  Undergraduate students get a quota of 100 MB.

Another area in which you have important ethical responsibilities is in your use of computing resources. This document describes some of these responsibilities and explains Bren School Department policy on student use of computing resources. Some of these policies might be different from what you would expect, so please read over and understand this document. </p>\n<p> The Bren School provides for you, the student, a wide range of computing resources from X-Terminals to PC's to large multiuser UNIX systems. These machines are expensive to buy and expensive to maintain, but it is our goal to provide you with the very best computing environment that we can. Many users depend on these computers for doing class assignments, research, and for communications. We are a community of computer users, and like any community we can all make the best use of our resources if we establish some guidelines for how we can use them responsibly. </p>\n<p> Some computing facilities, such as those which hold classified data, may establish expensive and complex security systems In our department we do not do this; we have some security mechanisms which greatly decrease the risk that one user will accidentally interfere with another, but it does not require great ingenuity to get around these mechanisms. As a result, we need to trust the people who use our machines. </p>\n<p> The fundamental principle behind our policies is this: While using the computers, you should never do anything that harms another user or prevents him or her from getting work done. </p>\n<p> If you have any questions about these rules, or if you suspect that an account (your or someone else's) has been broken into, please contact the Bren School Computing Support Group. To do this, send mail to the address <a href=\"mailto:helpdesk@ics.uci.edu\"> helpdesk@ics.uci.edu</a>, or go to Support's office, CS346, and explain the problem.</p>\n<h3>Computer Accounts</h3>\n<p> The Bren School has a wide range of computers available, located in several different labs. Some of these labs are open only to people enrolled in certain classes, some are available for general drop-in use. Each Bren School major is given both a Windows account, and a UNIX account on the Sun workstations. Different courses will require different platforms to be used. Non-majors will be given accounts only if required for a course in which they are enrolled. </p>\n<p> All Bren School computers are to be used only by Bren School students, faculty, and staff. People outside the Bren School who wish to use computers should go see the people in the <a href=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/\">Office of Information Technology</a>&#160;(<span>Multipurpose Science and Technology Building (Building 415 - 2nd\n Floor)). They provide computing for non-Bren School people.</span></p>\n<p> Any computer account created for you remains the property of the Regents of the University of California. You are responsible for this account, and you may not allow any other person to use it. The primary purpose of your account is to allow you to carry out your computing assignments and other instructional activities. You may also make modest use of these resources for other purposes, such as sending electronic mail to friends on campus, reading the electronic bulletin boards, and playing games, provided that this usage does not significantly interfere with instructional use of the machines. </p>\n<p> An example of how one might \"significantly interfere\" would be to tie up a computer for game-playing when no other computers are free and someone else is waiting to use the computer to do an assignment. If you have a game or other program you would like to make available to other users, please give it to the system administrator for public installation (You can contact the system administrator by sending mail to <a href=\"mailto:helpdesk@ics.uci.edu\"> helpdesk@ics.uci.edu</a>). You may not use the machines for commercial purposes, such as preparing bills for your company or advertising products, or for work related to non-UCI organizations, such as an off-campus political or religious group. More details about this are given below. If you are in doubt about whether some use of the machines is allowed, ask the Support Group.</p>\n<h3>Ethical Behavior</h3>\n<p> Here is a list of some examples of activities that the department does not allow. If a student makes such unethical use of Bren School computers, he/she will be subject to the penalties described in the <a href=\"OLD_index.php#disciplinary\"> Disciplinary Procedures</a> section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> You may not introduce viruses, worms, Trojan horses, password cracking or login spoofing programs on any University computer or network. In fact, because of the serious damage such programs can cause, the Bren School faculty have adopted a policy which forbids students even to have these types of programs in their accounts or to place them onto any Bren School computer; you may not store such a program on a Bren School computer even if you only wish to study it.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not try to use equipment or accounts that have not been assigned to you.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not interfere with others' ability to make use of the resources. For example, it might be reasonable to lock a workstation if you need to leave the room for two or three minutes, but it is not reasonable to lock it while you leave to buy lunch. Another example would be doing something that ties up all or a significant fraction of the machine, thus preventing others from receiving their fair share.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not destroy other people's work.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not \"spy\" on people, that is, you may not attempt to gain information from their accounts or from their external drives when there is good reason to believe that they do not wish you to obtain that information. This includes both attempting to violate the protection facilities provided by the system and also taking deliberate advantage of someone else's failure to protect sensitive information on their account. This works both ways; faculty, staff and members of Computing Support also have the responsibility to respect the privacy of the student. For example, it would be unethical for a faculty member or Support Group member to browse through your personal messages just out of curiosity, even if they have a security level that allows them to do so; we agree to respect your privacy. We do, however retain the right to inspect material on your account when this is necessary to investigate a suspected violation of university rules, such as a cheating incident or a violation of the rules in this document.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not send mail that appears to come from someone else.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not advertise any commercial products or use your account to earn money. Non-commercial things like posting your used car advertisement on <kbd> ics.market</kbd> are permitted, though. If for some reason you need an account that can be used for commercial purposes, see the Office of Academic Computing.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not display offensive material in any publicly accessible area. There are materials available on the Internet and elsewhere that some members of the Bren School community will find offensive. (One example is sexually explicit graphics; another is political argument on such issues as abortion.) Bren School and the University are committed to maintaining the free and open exchange of ideas as well as a non-offensive working environment. Thus, Bren School does not restrict the availability of potentially offensive material, but Bren School does regard as unethical conduct the display of such material in any publicly accessible area, including on workstation screens in public rooms and in computer labs.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may <strong>not</strong> use the computers' printers as copying machines. For example, you may not print out one hundred copies of a report; instead, print out one copy of the report and use a copying machine to obtain the other 99.</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may not use Bren School resources to illegally distribute copyrighted material.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"disciplinary\"></a>Disciplinary Procedures</h3>\n<p> What happens if you violate any of these rules? It depends on the seriousness of the offense, but could be one or more of the following. Disciplinary procedures and sanctions will be consistent with those outlined in the UCI Implementation of ``Interim Policies and Procedures Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part A.''</p>\n<ol>\n<li> You may have to meet with the chair of the Computing Resources Committee (CRC), the Dean of the Bren School, or the manager of the Bren School Support Group to discuss abuse of computing resources.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li> Your account may be locked. (Again, we recognize an obligation to respect your rights as well. No student account will be locked without discussion and approval of the Dean of the Bren School, or the chair of the CRC, except in the case of security violations. It would not be ethical for us to lock your account capriciously; for example, we agree not to lock it simply because you send a message to a bboard expressing disagreement with some Department policy or action.)\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li> For minor infractions, some form of departmental services (e.g., cleaning a lab) may be requested in exchange for unlocking the account.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li> For offenses involving abusing computing resources, cheating on course related work, or preventing others from working on assignments, your grade may be lowered in the class or you may receive a failing grade.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li> For severe offenses, or repeating minor offenses, you may lose access to all Bren School computing facilities for a period of time. Access to computing can be denied for a limited time (e.g., one week, the remainder of the quarter, an entire quarter) or permanently.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li> You may be suspended or dismissed from the University.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li> In serious cases, your name and a description of the violation may be reported to the police. California Penal Code Section 502 makes certain computer abuses a crime, and penalties can range up to a $10,000 fine and up to three years in prison.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Good Citizenship</h3>\n<p> Your cooperation in the following areas will help us make efficient use of the computing resources and will avoid unnecessary impositions on the time of faculty, staff, and other students. These are not the sort of things which we can expect to enforce rigidly; rather, we are asking your cooperation for the benefit of the whole departmental community Violations of these guidelines would not ordinarily result in any of the penalties listed above beyond number one, unless they were especially flagrant or persist after faculty or staff have asked you to stop. </p>\n<p> 1. Please be careful not to use the computer to annoy people, for example by sending them messages which they do not wish to receive. (The mail system makes it rather easy to send a message to a very large group of people; please be responsible in your use of this capability. In particular, when you reply to a message sent to a large group, avoid cc'ing your reply to the entire group unless it is a matter of interest to them.) </p>\n<p> 2. Please do not waste anything (i.e., paper, disk space, CPU time, people time, etc.). Please put your old printouts in the recycling bins. </p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong> </p>\n<p> Some of these polices are adapted from those used by the UCLA CS Department.
