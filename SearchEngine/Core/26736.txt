With the \nadvent of EJB, server-side Java moves into the mainstream. This talk \npresents the EJB component architecture, and describes how developers can \nbuild robust, scalable server systems in Java in a platform-, database-, \nand application server-independent fashion.\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography:</strong> Bob Pasker is a chief architect and founder of \nWebLogic. Pasker has been designing and developing networking, \ncommunications, transaction processing, and database products and \napplications for 20 years.
