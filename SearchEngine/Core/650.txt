We describe\nalgorithms for solving such problems for minimum spanning trees,\nshortest paths, and other \"optimal subgraph\" problems, and discuss\napplications in multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource\nallocation, and board game programming. \n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 650.0}
