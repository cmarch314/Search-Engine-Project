The main\r\nvirtue of this representation is its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which\r\ncan translate into exponential time savings for search algorithms. In [1] we introduced\r\na linear space AND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB) search scheme that\r\nexplores the AND/OR search tree for solving optimization tasks. In this paper\r\nwe extend the algorithm by equipping it with a context-based adaptive caching\r\nscheme similar to good and nogood recording, thus it explores an AND/OR graph\r\nrather than the AND/OR tree. We also improve the algorithm by using a new\r\nheuristic for generating close to optimal height pseudo-trees, based on a well\r\nknown recursive decomposition of the hypergraph representation. We illustrate\r\nour results using a number of benchmark networks, including the very challenging\r\nones that arise in genetic linkage analysis.</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<!-- <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~csp/r125.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a> <br> -->\r\n<A href=\"r125.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8371.0}
