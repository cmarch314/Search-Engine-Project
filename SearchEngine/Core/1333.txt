{"text": "Scott Jordan Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of California Irvine Net Neutrality Case Study Net Neutrality concerns among many aspects whether and on what basis Internet traffic can be prioritized There are many sides to this issue and the folks arguing do not even agree on the definition of Net Neutrality See the wikipedia entry on Net Neutrality for an overview but beware that it does not represent all views The FCC recently passed net neutrality regulations The regulations contain a number of provisions In this case study we only consider the no unreasonable discrimination rule that is part of the FCC s Open Internet Order Net neutrality is the hottest current Internet public policy debate It is likely that these regulations will be challenged in the courts In addition Congress continues to debate the issue Here are materials to prepare for the case study My slides from lecture Read the Congressional Research Service s Access to Broadband Networks and Access to Broadband Networks The Net Neutrality Debate to get an introduction to Net Neutrality and the issues surrounding it These reports were prepared for members of Congress to learn about the issue Read Background for net neutrality case study which I wrote to give you background on technical and legal aspects underlying the issue Read parts of the FCC s Open Internet Order which implements regulations Read their justification for creating regulations on pages 4 27 The provision we will focus on is the no unreasonable discrimination rule which is discussed on pages 4 47 You can find the FCC commissioners arguments for and against the Order on pages 135 194 Here are links to media coverage The New York Times net neutrality issue page The Washington Post has frequent articles on the topic National Public Radio has frequent pieces on the topic including a primer by Planet Money Los Angeles Times Phone Cable May Charge Dot Coms That Want to Race Along the Internet There are also

position Your classmates are Senators You should argue for or against the no unreasonable discrimination rule that is part of the FCC s Open Internet Order Net neutrality Pro means you should argue for the no unreasonable discrimination rule and generally for prohibiting Internet Service Providers from unreasonable prioritization of Internet traffic Net neutrality Con means you should argue against the no unreasonable discrimination rule and generally against prohibiting Internet Service Providers from unreasonable prioritization of Internet traffic Quickly and concisely define your position Don t assume that the Senators know what the issue is or what your position is Present your most persuasive arguments in the most powerful manner you can However be accurate Include technical economic and public policy aspects You don t need to answer all of the following questions but you should have at least one technical argument at least one economic argument and at least one public policy argument Technical questions On what basis will ISPs be allowed to prioritize packets Would Skype packets be prioritized Economic questions Who could pay for prioritization Do the ISPs have market power over what Do application providers like Google have market power over what Public policy questions Does society as a whole have an interest in who provides what and who charges for what on the Internet If you are a Staffer Try to convince your Senator what is best for your constituents You can argue that they should vote for the FCC s no unreasonable discrimination rule that they should vote against the FCC s no unreasonable discrimination rule or that they should amend the rule in some specific way Quickly and concisely define your position Assume that the class has heard the Lobbyist arguments Include technical economic and public policy aspects You don t need to answer all of the following questions but you should have at least one technical argument at least one economic argument and at least one public policy argument Technical questions On what basis will ISPs be allowed to prioritize packets Would packets used in Apple s FaceTime application be prioritized Economic questions Who could pay for prioritization What approach would maximize social welfare Public policy questions Is a level playing field the right goal between whom Scott Jordanlast modified
