{"text": "Summary Create a web page giving an overview of some programming language Often you hear about some programming language and you d like to get a quick overview of that language not a whole course in how to use it but some indication of what it does what it looks like where it s used and so on This is your opportunity to pick one language and create such an overview on a web page that will be part of the ICS 141 materials on line How does this affect my course grade This project is entirely optional It doesn t have a direct effect on your course grade There aren t any course points associated with it it won t make up for weak performance on the homeworks or exams On the other hand if you do reasonably well in the course doing a good job on this project might give your course grade a small boost In addition a good job on this project lets me say something unique and positive about you if you ask me to be a job reference or to write a letter of recommendation this means much more than a simple recitation of how good a grade you got in my class Finally the main reason to do it is that it s fun to learn about something new and unusual and it s a gentle manageable introduction to doing some independent research What language should I choose You may choose any language from the list below Alphard Algol 6 Algol 68 APL AppleScript APT Autocoder Awk B BCPL BLISS CLOS CLU Dylan Forth Frontier Haskell Icon ISETL Jovial Leda Logo Mathematica Miranda ML SML Standard ML Modula Modula 2 Modula 3 nroff troff Oberon Object Pascal PL 36 PL I PL C Prograph PPL Python REXX RPG RPG II Simula Smalltalk Snobol Stagecast Creator T Tcl and Tk TeX Turing Visual Basic VBA WATFOR WATFIV If you d like to choose a language that isn t on the list check with me first Any language for this project must be a Turing equivalent programming language and it can t be a language that was done last quarter or one of these popular languages Ada Basic C C Cobol Fortran Java Pascal Prolog or Scheme Only one person in the class may choose a given language To reserve a language send Email with your request to kay on EA or at ICS if someone has already chosen your language I ll let you know and you can pick again Once you reserve a language you may not change your choice so it s a good idea to do a bit of preliminary research to make sure the language you ask for is the one you want to stay with Where can I find information A good place to start is the textbook and the references in its bibliography Most of the publications listed should be available in the Science Library These Web based resources should also be helpful but note that some of these aren t academically authoritative The Language List http cuiwww unige ch cgi bin langlist Programming Language Resources http burks brighton ac uk burks language language htm The Hello World Page http www latech edu acm HelloWorld shtml 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall http www ionet net timtroyr funhouse beer html Amazon com should point you to books on many of the languages the titles may be useful on your page even if you don t read a whole book on your language A general web search e g on google com What should I put on my page Include answers to as many of the following questions as possible Remember though that quality is more important than quantity Give short answers to the questions supplemented where possible by references to printed publications or the Web that give more detail How do you characterize the language in one sentence what kind of language is it Scheme for example is a compact lexically scoped dialect of Lisp Who designed it Where When Why was this language designed What were its unique strengths at the time What is it used for and where is it used today What variations and dialects of this language exist Distinguish this from the various implementations of the same language What other languages are good or better alternatives to this one What are the technical characteristics of the language What paradigms does it support How would you classify it in terms of the concepts we cover in the course What implementations of the language are available for what platforms What courses texts and on line resources are available Give some sample code or programs not just Hello world but something representative of the strengths of the language You can include a small sample on your page and links to something larger if possible What form or design should I use for my page Use whatever you think is most effective subject to these guidelines Even though the information is presented as questions above a question and answer organization probably isn t the best way to present your information Keep the design clean and elegant This is academic information so off subject jokes or remarks and irrelevant graphics aren t appropriate Try to make your writing comply with standard academic English At the very least run spell check on the text and take some extra time to proofread and edit your prose Don t copy text or code from another site if that information is copyrighted Anything with a copyright notice e g Copyright 1999 by Paula Programmer or some other prohibition on copying should be left where it is You may link to copyrighted information though If you copy non copyrighted information onto your site give a citation to the original It s okay if your site is just a compilation of information found elsewhere so long as you don t make it appear as if the information comes originally from you Put your name your Email address and your home page if you have one at the bottom of your page What do I do when it s done Two things Drop a folder containing the HTML source and any additional files into the ICS 141 dropbox on the Masterhit server Then send an Email to ics141 uci edu to let us know you re done Final web pages must be submitted by 5 p m on Friday of the tenth week Have fun ", "_id":
