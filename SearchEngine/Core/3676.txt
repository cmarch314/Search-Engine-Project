The\ninput of the problem is a family of pairwise commuting Hermitian operators\n<nobr><i>H</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>H<sub>r</sub></i></nobr> on a\nHilbert space (<i>C</i><sup><i>d</i></sup>)<sup>&#8855;n</sup> and a\nstring of real numbers <nobr>&#955;<sub>1</sub>, ...,\n&#955;<sub><i>r</i></sub>.</nobr> The problem is to determine whether\nthe common eigenspace specified by equalities <i>H<sub>a</sub></i>\n|&#968;> = &#955;<sub><i>a</i></sub> |&#968;> for <nobr><i>a</i> = 1,\n..., <i>r</i></nobr> has a positive dimension.

A non-trivial question is whether the\nproblems (i) or (ii) belong to NP? We show that the answer is positive\nfor some special values of <i>k</i> and <i>d</i>.
