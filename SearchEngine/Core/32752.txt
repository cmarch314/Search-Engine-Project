If you do not get a response to the email in 24 hours (except weekends), please resend it or come to office hours. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Late Penalty</p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>Generally speaking the late penalty is 1% per hour after the due date.</p>\n    <p>Due dates are usually 11:59pm on the day an assignment is due. </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Sick Policy </p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>If you find that you are unable to make it to a scheduled event (exam, presentation, etc.) of some sort due to sickness, please get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class. In the absence of such documentation, please contact the staff as soon as you realize that you are going to miss a scheduled  event. Generally sicknesses will be treated on a case by case basis. We will accommodate you as best as we can depending on the circumstances. </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Add/Drop: </p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>Electronic Add/Drop only.

This includes code you find on the web, text from books, and answers from friends. If an assignment requires you to do the work yourself, then acknowledging the source of an answer does not fulfill the requirements of the assignment. I reserve the right to fail students who do not display complete academic integrity. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Web Page and Readings:</p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p> The Web page for the class is subject to update.
