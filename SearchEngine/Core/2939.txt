In this paper, we develop a computational model for\nfigure/ground assignment in complex natural scenes. We utilize a large dataset\nof images annotated with human-marked segmentations and figure/ground labels\nfor training and quantitative evaluation.<p>\n\nWe operationalize the concept of familiar configuration by constructing\nprototypical local shapes, i.e. shapemes, from image data. Shapemes\nautomatically encode mid-level visual cues to figure/ground assignment such as\nconvexity and parallelism. Based on the shapeme representation, we train a\nlogistic classifier to locally predict figure/ground labels. We also consider a\nglobal model using a conditional random field (CRF) to enforce global\nfigure/ground consistency at T-junctions. We use loopy belief propagation to\nperform approximate inference on this model and learn maximum likelihood\nparameters from ground-truth labels.<p>\n\nWe find that the local shapeme model achieves an accuracy of 64% in predicting\nthe correct figural assignment. This compares favorably to previous studies\nusing classical figure/ground cues. We evaluate the global model using\neither a set of contours extracted from a low-level edge detector or the set of\ncontours given by human segmentations. The global CRF model significantly\nimproves the performance over the local model, most notably when using\nhuman-marked boundaries (78%).  These promising experimental results show that\nthis is a feasible approach to bottom-up figure/ground assignment in natural\nimages.<p>\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/RenFM_ECCV_2006/RenFM_ECCV_2006.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nXiaofeng Ren, Charless&nbsp;C.
