We present an \r\nimprovement to GSAT that is sensitive to the problem's structure. When the problem \r\nhas a tree structure the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution in linear time. \r\nFor non-tree networks, the algorithm designates a subset of nodes, called cutset, and\r\nexecutes a regular GSAT algorithm on this set of variables. On all the rest of the \r\nvariables it executes a specialized local search algorithm for trees. This algorithm \r\nfinds an assignment that, like GSAT, locally minimizes the sum of unsatisfied \r\nconstraints and also globally minimizes the number of conflicts in every tree-like \r\nsub-network. We will present results of experiments showing that this new algorithm \r\noutperforms regular GSAT on sparse networks whose cycle-cutset size is bounded by 30% \r\nof the nodes.</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"R46.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"R46.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8554.0}
