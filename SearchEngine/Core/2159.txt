The matrix\nstarts out with all probabilities equal, then (after loading <a\nhref=\"freqc.txt.gz\">a dictionary of English word frequencies</a>)\nrepeats the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For each word in the dictionary that matches a word of the\ncryptogram, the word's frequency is multiplied by the matrix\nentries for its individual letters, giving an overall probability\nof seeing that word in that position.</li>\n\n<li>For each pair of a code word and a possible decryption of that\nword, we build a 26x26 matrix in which the probability of finding\nthat word is as large as possible (with uniform probabilities for\nunrelated letters). We then replace our original matrix with a new\nmatrix formed as a weighted average of the word matrices, where the\nweights are the word probabilities computed in the first step.</li>\n\n<li>A minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm computes the most\nlikely decryption for the current matrix.</li>\n\n<li>We try all possible ways of swapping two letters in the\ndecryption, keeping a swap when it improves the quality (number of\nrecognized words and product of frequencies of those words). If we\nfind a good swap we also adjust the matrix to make that decryption\nmore likely in future iterations.</li>\n\n<li>For each word of the decryption, we use the dictionary to find\nall other words that could replace it without changing anything in\nthe rest of the decryption. If we find any such words, we use the\none with the highest frequency.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At each iteration, the iteration number and quality of the current\ntranslation are shown in the browser's status line. The decryption\nshown in the main window is the best one found so far, which is not\nnecessarily the one from the latest iteration.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/cryptograms.html\">Graham\nToal's cryptogram source code page</a> for alternative cryptogram-solving\nalgorithms.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"LEFT\"><small><a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cryptogram\">Return to\nCryptogram Helper</a></small></td>\n<td align=\"RIGHT\"><small><a href=\"source.html\">View source</a></small></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2159.0}
