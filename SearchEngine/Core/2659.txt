The dropbox will have a automatic deadline of 11:59 pm on the given due date. <i> No homeworks will be accepted after that time</i>. I know this is a tough requirement, but in return, I'll award extra credit for early-submitted homeworks as described below. If you are working down to the last minute, <b> please </b> make sure something is uploaded 10 minutes prior to the deadline to ensure you won't get zero credit.\n\n\n    <h3>Grading</h3>\n    \n    Each assignment has both programming and written components.  Your\n    code will be graded both on clarity and correctness.  \n    It is generally more important that your code be clear and\n    correct than fast.  Your writeup should \n    be richly illustrated with graphs and images, and your code\n    should be well commented and documented.\n\n    <h3>Extra-credit</h3>      \n      Any homework that is handed in one day early (11:59 pm on the previous day) will get 10% extra-credit. For a 100-point assignment, this is 10 extra points.      \n    \n\n    <h3>Homework Submission Instructions</h3>\n    \n    <p> Submit a pdf file with your writeup into the appropriate directory in the <tt>EEE Dropbox</tt>. \n    Also submit a zip or tar archive containing a folder with all your code.  The name of the folder\n    should be <tt>YourName</tt> so that when I unzip it, everything is nicely self contained.\n    Include everything that your code needs to run.  If I hand out code as part of the\n    assignment, please include that also.\n      \n    <p>\n      Zip or tar the <tt>YourName</tt> \n      directory and submit either <tt>YourName.zip</tt> or \n      <tt>YourName.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>YourName.tgz</tt>.\n      You can create an archive\n      of the <tt>YourName</tt> directory in various ways\n      depending on the platform:\n      \n    <p>\n    <ul>\n      <li> Right-click on the folder and select \"Create archive\".\n\tSelect either \"zip\" or \"tar.gz\" to create the archive, or\n      <li> In a terminal, cd to the directory\n\tcontaining <tt>YourName</tt> and type <tt>zip -r YourName\n\t  YourName</tt> to create <tt>YourName.zip</tt>, or\n      <li> In the terminal, type <tt>tar cfz YourName.tgz YourName</tt>\n\t\n\tto create <tt>YourName.tgz</tt>.\n    </ul>\n    \n    <p>You can list the contents of a zip archive with the command\n      <tt>unzip -l YourName</tt> and the contents of a tar archive with\n      the command <tt>tar tfz YourName.tgz</tt>.\n      \n    <h3>Homework Writeup Guidelines</h3>\n    \n    <p>\n      You must submit your writeups as as a single PDF file. \n      <em>I will not accept writeups in any word processing format\n\tsuch as MS Word or Open Office.</em>  You are welcome to create\n      the writeup in whichever word processor you like but in the\n      end you need to save it as a pdf file.\n      \n    <p>Some guidelines for your figures:\n      \n    <ul>\n      \n\t<p><li><b>Use a proper size and aspect ratio.</b>  If you are showing\n\tan image, make sure that the pixels are displayed square.  Use\n\tthe <tt>axis image</tt> command.  If the image is not too large,\n\tensure that image and screen pixels coincide with the\n\t\n\t<tt>truesize</tt> command.\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Always show the colorbar for 2D data.</b>  Whether your are\n\tshowing an image or data in the form of an image, always show the\n\tcolorbar.  If you are showing an image, this will verify that the\n\tcolor map spans the correct range (usually <tt>[0,1]</tt>).  If\n\tyou are showing data, then this will show the meaning of the colors.\n\tThe only exception is when you show RGB images; in that case, the\n\tcolorbar is meaningless because the colormap is not used.\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Use a sensible color map.</b>  There are a couple standard color\n\tmaps available in MATLAB: <tt>gray</tt>, <tt>jet</tt>,\n\tand <tt>hsv</tt>.  In the few cases where your data is periodic\n\t(such as with angles), then use <tt>colormap hsv</tt>.  Otherwise,\n\tuse <tt>gray</tt> or <tt>jet</tt>.  Which is appropriate\n\tdepends on what you are trying to show.  Use the colormap that most\n\teffectively communicates your point.\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Use a proper display range.</b>  If you are showing a\n\tgrayscale image, make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors.\n\tThe <tt>imagesc</tt> command has an optional parameter for this\n\tpurpose, e.g. <tt>imagesc(im,[0,1])</tt> will make sure the color\n\tmap spans the range <tt>[0,1]</tt>.  If you are showing data, then\n\tallowing <tt>imagesc</tt> to scale the color map to the range of\n\tthe data is usually appropriate.  If your data is mostly symmetric\n\taround zero, then consider using a display range that is symmetric\n\taround zero,\n\te.g. <nobr><tt>imagesc(im,[-1,1]*max(abs(im(:))))</tt></nobr>\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Consider screen capture for figures.</b>  There are\n\tthree ways to create images of your figures in MATLAB:  \n\t<p>\n\t<ul>\n\t  <li> Use a screen capture utility.  \n\t  <li> Select File > Save As... from the figure window, and export as\n\t    an image (PNG, TIFF, JPG, etc.).\n\t  <li> Use the <tt>print</tt> command.\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Use imwrite() for saving images.</b>  To directly export\n\tan image from Matlab, use the <tt>imwrite</tt> command.  \n\t\n\t\n    </ul>\n    \n    \n\n    <hr>\n  </body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2659.0}
