of the cases in the original USCensus199 raw data set were randomly permuted Selection of attributes The 68 attributes included in the data set are given below In the USCensus199 data set we have added a single letter prefix to the original name We add the letter i to indicate that the original attribute values are used and d to indicate that original attribute values for each case have been
