The UIDA system is able to \nquickly identify inconsistent style guide interpretations and \nUI design decisions resulting from distributed development of \nmultiple UI sub-systems. This case arises when each sub-system\nconforms to the general style guide rules, but when\nintegrated together, may appear inconsistent.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:46:18 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 25942.0}
