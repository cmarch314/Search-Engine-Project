(It should have the web bill_web.)\n    <li> The Chimera Server running. (It should be connected to bill_web\n\tand the places_to_go link should be selected as the active link.)\n    <li> Jimage running.

Note: If you \ngo to the Chimera Server and logout from the bill_web and log into \nthe flight_web, your anchors will disappear from the images.  \nThe reason for this is that\nflight_web has no information saying that the anchors exist on the images.\nThis information is stored on Chimera, not the image.
