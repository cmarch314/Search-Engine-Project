{"text": "ICS 23 CSE 23 Setting Up Java At Home A word of warning One of the advantages of programming in Java is that it s possible to set up your own computer as a Java development environment easily and cheaply On the other hand working in the lab has some genuine benefits particularly for those of you who are fairly new to programming In the lab you ll find that help is more readily available when you get stuck that your machine setup will generally be stable and designed well for the task of working on your assignments and that you re free of the distractions of your home Nevertheless I m aware that many of you either out of want or need will choose to do some percentage of your work at home What follows is enough information to turn your Windows based machine into a Java development environment at little or no cost Getting started Before you get started be aware that this document only describes how to set up Java on a Windows machine If you re using a Macintosh or running Linux I m sorry to say that you re on your own though you may find that many of the concepts here will translate fairly well to your system First and foremost you need a Java compiler and Java virtual machine There are several packages that include these tools but a great option is to download the Java 2 Standard Edition J2SE SDK from java sun com J2SE is absolutely free Remember you will need a version that is at least as recent as 1 5 which is also called 5 J2SE includes a Java compiler javac a Java virtual machine java and all of the standard Java library components in other words everything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem domains and more than enough firepower for the assignments we ll be giving you Make sure that you download the SDK not the JRE The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment which includes the necessary code to allow you to run Java programs but not to write and compile them Secondly you ll need a text editor which you ll use to write and edit your program code There are many inexpensive and or free options available In the lab we provide TextPad which you can download from www textpad com TextPad requires a modest registration fee which you should pay if you plan to use it on a continuous basis You may be able to find free text editors particularly those written in Java at shareware freeware download sites such as www download com Installation the easy part Presumably your text editor will include an installation program to set it up and make it completely ready for your use J2SE also includes an installation program which places all of the files into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts for you However after running the installation program you still won t be able to execute javac or java without making a couple of modifications under the hood of your system The not all that hard part PATH and CLASSPATH You can execute programs from a Command Prompt or as Windows 95 98 call it an MS DOS prompt by simply typing their names such as javac or java But there s a catch Windows has to know where it can find these programs This is the job of the PATH environment variable PATH is a list of folders separated by semicolons in which Windows will look for a program whenever you try to execute one Similarly whenever the Java compiler or Java virtual machine need to be able to use a Java class such as when you import a class from the Java library the compiler or virtual machine needs to be able to know where to find it This is the job of the CLASSPATH environment variable CLASSPATH is a list of folders separated by semicolons in which the Java compiler or virtual machine will look for a Java class whenever it s trying to find one So to make J2SE work you have to modify the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables on your system so that Windows will be able to find javac and java and so that javac and java will be able to find all of the necessary Java classes How you modify these variables depends on which version of Windows you re using In either case I ll assume that you ve installed J2SE into the default directory during installation which for the sake of this document let us assume is C jdk1 5 1 If you installed it somewhere else you ll need to use your installation directory instead of the one above On Windows 95 98 and probably ME I say probably because I don t have a version of ME handy to test this with On these versions of Windows you can set the PATH and CLASSPATH by modifying the file C AUTOEXEC BAT Add the following two lines to the end of this file set PATH PATH C jdk1 5 1 bin set CLASSPATH CLASSPATH C jdk1 5 1 lib You ll probably need to restart your system for these changes to take effect On Windows 2 and XP Right click the My Computer icon on your desktop and select Properties Select the Advanced tab Click the Environment Variables button Under System variables find the PATH variable and add this to the end of it C jdk1 5 1 bin Then find the CLASSPATH variable If it doesn t exist and it probably won t if you ve never used your system to develop Java code click the New button specifying CLASSPATH as its name and the following value C jdk1 5 1 lib You may need to restart your system or at least start up a new Command Prompt window in order for these changes to take effect That s it At this point you should be good to go Happy coding A few minor changes by Alex Thornton Fall 2 2 Originally written by Alex Thornton for ICS 21 and ICS 22 Summer 2 2 ", "_id":
