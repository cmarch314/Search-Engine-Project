The second part has yet to happen, but there are signs and plans which make us confident. The great need for information about information, to help us categorize, sort, pay for, own information is driving the design of languages for the web designed for processing by machines, rather than people.\u000bThe web of human-readable document is being merged with a web of machine-understandable data. The potential of the mixture of humans and machines working together and communicating through the web could be immense. \u000b\n</H2>\n</UL><UL>\n<LI><H2>W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee, May 1998</H2>\n</UL></P>\n<P></P> \n<P>\n<TABLE>\n  <TD HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100> <A HREF=\"tsld001.htm\">Previous slide</A> </TD>\n  <TD HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100> <A HREF=\"tsld003.htm\">Next slide</A> </TD>\n  <TD HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=150> <A HREF=\"tsld001.htm\">Back to first slide</A> </TD>\n  <TD HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=150> <A HREF=\"sld002.htm\">View graphic version</A> </TD>\n</TABLE>\n<BR>\n</P>\n\n\n\n</Body>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 34422.0}
