hypermedia operations which allow them to create and delete anchors Operations for adding anchors to links and initiating traversal should also be provided An advanced viewer will provide functions to search hyperwebs create and select links and modify existing anchors and Database Managers It is important to separate the notion of viewers from the related notion of clients Clients are executable programs which contain viewers Typically a client contains only a single viewer This one to one relationship often leads to confusion between the two However there is nothing preventing a client from harboring two or more viewers within itself As an example consider a client such as Microsoft Excel Excel contains viewers which manipulate and display worksheets macros charts and other data types Each viewer within Excel has to fulfill viewer responsibilities while Excel as a whole must fulfill client obligations By working together the client and its associated viewers provide the user with a hypermedia enabled application In addition to the responsibilities discussed above a viewer must fulfill the following obligations Register itself with the Chimera server Register the MIME types of the objects it displays Register its in ability to handle multiple views at once Register interest in the set of Chimera events it handles Notify the Chimera server when it is active within its client Notify the Chimera server of the views it is displaying All of the these responsibilities will be highlighted in the Chimera 2 tutorial However the notion of multiple views deserves further consideration Chimera supports a form of traversal known as delayed link traversal A delayed link traversal occurs when the Chimera server determines that a link traversal event must be sent to a viewer which is currently not available In this situation the server stores the link traversal event and invokes the desired viewer Once the viewer has initialized the Chimera server forwards the delayed event to it and the link traversal finally completes The rules for determing when a viewer is unavailable are closely related to whether a viewer supports multiple views The rules are as follows Determine if an active viewer is displaying the destination view of the link traversal If so send the event to that viewer Determine if a viewer which can display the destination view is active If so check to see if it has any active views If not send the event to that viewer If so only send the event to the viewer if it supports multiple views Repeat step two for all such potential viewers until the event is sent If all potential active viewers have been exhausted delay the event and invoke the desired viewer The upshot of these rules is to underscore the importance of a viewer indicating whether or not it can display multiple views Viewers which can support multiple views improve the overall efficiency of the system since operating system resources are saved from the burden of invoking multiple instances of the same viewer Developer Information The available operations on views are listed below For more information see the on line documentation activeViewer viewer
