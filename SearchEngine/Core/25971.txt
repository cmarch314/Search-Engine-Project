{"text": "Ancestry Chart Explanation These charts also known as Pedigree charts list a person s ancestors in graphic branching form Each person has a listing showing that person s name and vital dates In addition there are vertical lines connecting a child to known parents The person s father is listed above and the mother is listed below the person s listing Ahnentafel Chart Explanation Ahnentafel is a German word Ahnen meaning ancestors and tafel meaning chart These charts list a person s ancestors in lineal form rather than in graphic branching form as in Pedigree charts Except for the first person 1 all males are even numbered while all females are odd numbered The father of any person is double that person s number The mother of any person is one more than double that person s number So the father of person 1 is numbered 2 and the mother of person 1 is numbered 3 This same formula continues on through all ascending generations To determine the relationship of an ancestor to person 1 or to determine the descending lineage from any ancestor the formula is in reverse Simply divide the ahnentafel number by 2 for a male and subtract 1 and divide by 2 for a female If you want to determine the descendancy of the person whose ahnentafel number is 85 subtract one since this person is odd numbered we know it is a female and divide 84 by 2 to equal 42 So 85 is the mother of 42 42 is the father of 21 Again an odd number which tells us that 21 is the mother of 1 who is the father of 5 who is the mother of 2 who is the father of 1 Dan Hirschberg dan at ics uci edu Last modified Mar 21 2 14", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Krakow/explain.html", "title": "genealogy term explanations", "html": "<HTML><HEAD>\n<TITLE>Genealogy Term Explanations</TITLE>\n</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#90E0FF FGCOLOR=\"#000000\">\n\n<center>\n<a name=\"ancestry\"><H2>Ancestry Chart Explanation</H2></a>\n</center>\n\nThese charts (also known as Pedigree charts)\nlist a person's ancestors in graphic branching form.<P>\n\nEach person has a listing showing that person's name and vital dates.\nIn addition, there are vertical lines connecting\na child to known parents.\nThe person's father is listed above\n(and the mother is listed below)\nthe person's listing.\n\n<HR>\n\n<center>\n<a name=\"ahnen\"><H2>Ahnentafel Chart Explanation</H2></a>\n</center>\n\n<center>\nAhnentafel is a German word--<EM>Ahnen</EM> meaning ancestors,\nand <EM>tafel</EM> meaning chart.\n</center><p>\n\nThese charts list a person's ancestors in lineal form, rather than in\ngraphic branching form as in Pedigree charts.\nExcept for the first person (#1), all males are even-numbered,\nwhile all females are odd-numbered.<p>\n\nThe father of any person is double that person's number.\nThe mother of any person is one more than double that person's number.\nSo, the father of person #1 is numbered #2,\nand the mother of person #1 is numbered #3.\nThis same formula continues on through all ascending generations.<p>\n\nTo determine the relationship of an ancestor to person #1,\nor to determine the descending lineage from any ancestor,\nthe formula is in reverse.\nSimply divide the ahnentafel number by 2 for a male,\nand subtract 1 and divide by 2 for a female.<p>\n\nIf you want to determine the descendancy of the person whose\nahnentafel number is 85, subtract one\n(since this person is odd-numbered we know it is a female)\nand divide 84 by 2 to equal 42.\nSo #85 is the mother of #42;\n#42 is the father of #21.\nAgain, an odd number, which tells us that #21 is the mother of #10,\nwho is the father of #5, who is the mother of #2,\nwho is the father of #1.<p>\n\n<HR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan\"><I>Dan Hirschberg</I></a><br>\n<tt>dan at ics.uci.edu</tt><br>\n\nLast modified: Mar 21, 2014\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 25971.0}
