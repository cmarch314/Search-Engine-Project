{"text": "Project Guidelines CS 277 Data Mining Winter 2 14 The goal of your project is to give you hands on experience of applying data mining techniques to one or more large data sets going through the following steps identifying a data set and problem domain deciding on what you want to achieve with data mining choosing appropriate methods and algorithms implementing and testing your methods evaluating your techniques on your data sets reporting conclusions Here are the project deliverables and due dates Project DeliverableDue Date 1 Project Proposal Written proposal due in class Monday Jan 27th 2 Progress Report 1 Written report due in class Monday February 1 th Also submit electronic copy to EEE 3 Progress Report 2 Written report due in class Wednesday February 26th Also submit electronic copy to EEE 5 Final Project Report Submit to EEE dropbox by 8am Monday March 17th Data Sets You are strongly encouraged to use a data set from one of the Web sites listed below If there is a different data set that you would prefer to use please email me to request permission it should be a large data set for a problem area that you know something about or are interested in learning about Note that most data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are too small and too simple for a CS 277 project One or more of several well known text categorization data sets text with labels All or part of Wikipedia Web pages with links and category labels and other metadata The Million Song data set with audio features and metadata for 1 million songs music recommendation data Several million US patents from 198 to 2 12 text metadata time series Several million US trademark applications from 187 to 2 12 text metadata time series MIMIC II data set for intensive care patients time series metadata Google syntactic ngrams over time text time series Global Event Data Set with 25 million georeferenced events from 1979 to the present spatial temporal relational data of political events worldwide Any of the larger network data set available on the Stanford SNAP site relational network data temporal spatial Microsoft Learning to Rank data sets search engine result ranking for 3 k queries It is fine and even encouraged to combine any of the data sets above with 1 or more other data sets e g data sets not listed above that are of interest to you for example an interesting project would be to see if you can use information from Wikipedia to improve a text classification algorithm Note that you are not allowed to work on a data set you have worked with or are working with outside this class e g for a different class project for research etc unless you obtain approval from me first by explaining why this data is not being double counted for other purposes Types of Projects Here are some typical types of projects Focus on the data and a particular task e g prediction clustering and use multiple different algorithms from the literature to address this task The focus here might be more on the data set and the task than on the algorithms Focus on the algorithms compare one or more baseline algorithms with a new recently published algorithm the focus here might be to see if the new algorithm really works as well as described in the paper where it is published Develop a new algorithm method and implement it and apply it to a task and data set its important here to evaluate how your approach compares to existing baseline methods at least one Another example would be to take a well known technique such as logistic regression or SVD decomposition and carefully evaluate and compare a variety of different ways for fitting such models to data evaluating perhaps on multiple data sets rather than just on one This might require using more data sets than those I have listed above but you should try to include at least 1 of the data sets above if you can Note that a critically important part of any project is that you conduct careful empirical evaluations for example by using appropriate train test partitions of different approaches Also note that your project grade will not necessaily be correlated with the accuracy of your results for example a project developing a classification algorithm that achieves high accuracy on some classification task could receive a low score if you do not provide any insight into why the algorithm did well Conversely a project on classification with relatively low accuracies could get a very high score if you can provide insight and understanding into why the accuracies are not high Software You must use either R or Python or Matlab as the primary environment for your project You can call other code from within these environments or use other code in your pipeline but at a minimum for data visualization and analysis of model results you must use one of these 3 environments You can use any library functions toolboxes publicly available code as long as you clearly indicate this in your reports You are of course also encouraged to write your own custom software A typical project might involve a pipeline of data anlaysis processing steps some of which you write yourself and others where you use existing software Teaming Students can work on projects individually or in teams of 2 or 3 people For multi person teams I will expect to see the work of 2 or 3 people so you will need to think clearly about who will do what on the project and how to make sure that your project has enough work to justify having 2 or 3 people work on it For 2 or 3 person teams your progress report and final report will be a single report consisting of one common section for the project and then a seperate section briefly describing the work of each individual team member on the project Grades will be assigned individually 2 people on the same project might get different grades depending on their contributions but clearly they will be correlated with the overall quality of the project So you should think carefully and choose partners carefully before signing up for a team project Progress Report and Final Report More details will be provided closer to the dates that these are due Your reports should be clearly written and comprehensive Your final project report should be of the quality that is at the level of a conference or workshop paper The following outline from Professor Ray Mooney on a possible project report format may be helpful ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/courses/cs277/project_guidelines.html", "title": "cs 277: project guidelines", "html": "<!DOCTYPE
