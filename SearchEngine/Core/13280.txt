We define a variant of\nconfluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path\nbetween two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.\nWe show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,\nin contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.\nAdditionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points\nare on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed\ncyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.\nWe use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which\nall tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.\n<p>\n<li><b>Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines</b>.<br>\nD.

As a\nconsequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane\nwith each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with\nat most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a\nlinear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.\n<p>\n<li><b>Distance-sensitive point location made easy</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://cis.poly.edu/~aronov/\">B.
