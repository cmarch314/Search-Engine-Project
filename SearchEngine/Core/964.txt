Your proposal should be at least 2 pages and no more\r\nthan 3 pages long. &nbsp;Note that this template is intended to help\r\nyou in thinking about and organizing the different aspects of your\r\nproject - if you need to add an additional section in the template for\r\nyour project, that is fine - it is intended as a guideline. </span>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Project proposals will be graded like a homework assignment and\r\nreceive a weight of 20% of your overall grade.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> Proposals will primarily be graded\r\non (a) clarity (is it clear what will be done in this project?) and\r\n(b) completeness (does the proposal address all of\r\nthe important aspects of the proposed project?)</p>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">All students need to be part of a\r\nproject team. 2-person or 3-person teams are allowed. Only one project\r\nproposal should be uploaded per project (include\r\nall team member names in the proposal) - all team members will get the same grade for\r\nthe proposal.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Important:</span>\r\nat this stage of the quarter it will be impossible for you to plan out\r\nevery detail of the project - there are likely to be surprises and\r\nunanticipated changes to the plan along the way. &nbsp;For example, you\r\nmight find that the initial data set you chose is not really suitable\r\nand need to change data sets. Or that the algorithm you planned to\r\ninvestigate is not really suitable to the task and need to change to\r\nanother algorithm. Or that the problem you are addressing is too\r\ndifficult and that you need to pick a simpler one. This is all\r\nunderstandable and to be expected. Given this, your project proposal\r\nshould be your best estimate at this time of what your project will be\r\nabout - with the realization that there may need to be changes and\r\nadjustments along the way.<br /></span>&nbsp;<br /><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><big><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Project Topics</span></big><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">For\r\nadditional suggestions on project topics see the lecture slides from\r\nweek 2 and refer to the \"background reading and links\" pages on the\r\nclass Web site. <br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"></span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><br />&nbsp;</span><big style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><font style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><small><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What and where to submit:&nbsp;</span> <br />Please submit your project report in Word or rtf format to the EEE project proposal dropbox, by 5pm Friday January 30th. </small></font></big><br /><big style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><font style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><small>&nbsp;</small></font></big><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-family: Calibri;\"> </span><br /><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-family: Calibri;\">&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"></span><ul><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"></font></font></font></font></ul></body></html>", "id": 964.0}
