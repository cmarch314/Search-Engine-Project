{"text": " Current research projects Multi tasking in the workplace Over the last several years I have been studying the different ways that information workers experience disruptions in their work due to multi tasking and interruptions With students we have done field studies in the workplace where people s actions have been carefully measured to the second Not only do information workers switch continually among multiple tasks every three minutes on average but they also switch continually among interactions in varied organizational contexts These results challenge the traditional way that most IT is designed to organize information i e in terms of distinct tasks Instead we are exploring how IT can support information organization in a way consistent with a more natural way of organizing work in terms of thematically connected units of work or working spheres Some selected publications Bored Mondays and Focused Afternoons The Rhythm of Attention and Online Activity in the

Proceedings of ACM CHI 2 4 with Victor Gonzalez Technology use in disrupted environments When there is a major environmental disruption such as a natural disaster or war it is not only the technical infrastructure that needs to be repaired but also the human infrastructure I am currently studying collaboration resilience the extent to which people continue to work and socialize despite such a disruption In this project we are examining the role that information technology plays in helping people repair their human infrastructure We are focusing on the use of Web 2 technologies blogs wikis social networking sites video sharing and others that people use to be resilient in their work and lives during an environmental disruption Some selected publications Narco Emotions Affect and

and distributed interaction new organizational forms Collaboration is becoming ubiquitious at the same time the emergence of new technologies have been changing the landscape of interaction and collaboration I am interested in the effect that information technologies have on collaboration and the development of new organizational practices such as network centricity group to group collaboration nomadic work and large scale collaboration I am also very interested in how Web 2 technologies blogs wikis social networking sites etc are used in collaboration and how they can be

These results challenge the traditional way that most IT is designed to organize information, i.e. in terms of distinct tasks. Instead, we are exploring how IT can support information organization in a way consistent with a more natural way of organizing work, in terms of thematically connected units of work, or working spheres. <br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\">Some selected publications:<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_2\"><a title=\"Research_files/Focus .pdf\" href=\"Research_files/Focus%20.pdf\">Bored Mondays and Focused Afternoons: The Rhythm of Attention and Online Activity in the Workplace</a><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Proceedings of ACM CHI 2014 (with Shamsi Iqbal, Mary Czerwinski and Paul Johns) <span style=\"line-height: 25px; \" class=\"style_2\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Honorable Mention for Best Paper.\u00a0 <span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_3\">New</span><span style=\"line-height: 25px; \" class=\"style_2\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_4\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_5\"><a title=\"Research_files/Millennial Camera-Ready Submission4.pdf\" href=\"Research_files/Millennial%20Camera-Ready%20Submission4.pdf\">Stress and multitasking in everyday college life: An empirical study of online activity<span style=\"line-height: 25px; \" class=\"style_4\"><br /></span></a></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Proceedings of ACM CHI 2014 (with Yiran Wang and Melissa Niiya)<span style=\"line-height: 25px; \" class=\"style_2\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Honorable Mention for Best Paper.\u00a0 <span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_3\">New</span><span style=\"line-height: 25px; \" class=\"style_2\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><a title=\"Research_files/WorkSense final camera-ready.pdf\" href=\"Research_files/WorkSense%20final%20camera-ready.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\">Capturing the Mood: Facebook and Face-to-Face Encounters in the Workplace. </a><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\">Proceedings of CSCW 2014 (with Shamsi Iqbal, Mary Czerwinski and Paul Johns\u00a0 </span><span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_5\">New</span><span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_6\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_6\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_6\"><a title=\"Research_files/Most Liked Fewest Friends.pdf\" href=\"Research_files/Most%20Liked%20Fewest%20Friends.pdf\">Most Liked, Fewest Friends: Patterns of Enterprise Social Media Use<br /></a></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\">Proceedings of CSCW 2014 (with Ido Guy, Shiri Kramer-Davidson, Michal Jacovi)\u00a0 </span><span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_6\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Honorable Mention for Best Paper.\u00a0 <span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_3\">New</span><span style=\"line-height: 21px; \" class=\"style_6\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><a title=\"Research_files/CHI 2012.pdf\" href=\"Research_files/CHI%202012.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\">\u201cA Pace not dictated by electrons\u201d: An empirical study of work without email </a><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_1\">\u00a0 <br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">Proceedings of ACM CHI 2012\u00a0 (with Stephen Voida and Armand Cardello)<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Honorable Mention for Best Paper.\u00a0<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_8\"><a title=\"Research_files/CHI 2011 Self-interruption.pdf\" href=\"Research_files/CHI%202011%20Self-interruption.pdf\">Why do I keep interrupting myself?

In this project we are examining the role that information technology plays in helping people repair their human infrastructure. We are focusing on the use of Web 2.0 technologies: blogs, wikis, social networking sites, video-sharing, and others that people use to be resilient in their work and lives during an environmental disruption.<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px;
