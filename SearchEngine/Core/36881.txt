X-Score was formerly known as X-CScore.</p>\n\n<p>X-Score estimates binding free energies for protein-ligand complexes with \nknown 3D structures.

Then, X-Score can be \napplied to give more accurate estimation of the binding free energies of these \nmolecules and re-rank them accordingly..</p>\n\n<p>The correct way to refer this program is either X-Tool/Score or the shorter \nform, X-Score.&nbsp;The following reference is required to be cited in any \nresulting publication.</p>\n\n<p> <font color=\"#0000FF\"><a href=\"xscore.pdf\">Wang, R.; Lai, L.; Wang, S. \n<em style=\"font-style: normal\">Further \nDevelopment and Validation of Empirical Scoring Functions for Structure-Based \nBinding Affinity Prediction. </em> <em>J.
