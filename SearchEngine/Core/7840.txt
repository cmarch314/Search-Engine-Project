However, people's information needs are often\n\t\t    context specific. In this project, we aim to improve the understanding of roles that context-awareness plays in information management.\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t    <div class=\"subTitle\">Personal Rules in Diabetes Self-management</div>\n\t\t    <div>Website: <a href=\"http://informatics-study.ics.uci.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">HealthWatch</a></div>\n\t\t    <div>One important part of diabetes self-management is to see the patterns between diet, exercise and glucose levels. Experienced patients apply this knowledge to control their sugar levels and minimize the use of insulin injection. In this project, we aim to create systems that assist such a practise. This ongoing project is supervised by Professor Alfred Kobsa, Professor Yunan Chen (both from Informatics, UC Irvine), and Professor Dara Sorkin (School of Medicine, UC Irinve). I am actively involved in designing the study, developing the software prototypes, data collection, and data analysis. </div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t    <div class=\"subTitle\">Clinical Information on a Timeline</div>\n\t\t    <div>Accumulated patient information from various sources over time can be hard to decode. Clinicians need to see the relation among events to hypothesize or verify theories. Temporal relations are useful clues for such an analysis. In this project, we conducted user studies and participatory design to explore requirements for a web system that visualizes temporal events. This ongoing project is supervised by Professor Wendy Chapman and Professor Robert El-Kareh (both from iDash, UC San Diego). As a 2012 summer intern, I was involved in the design and development of a prototype web system used in the study. </div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t    </ul>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <div class=\"sectionHeader\" id=\"teaching\">Teaching</div>\n        <p>\n\t    <ul>\n\t    <li>2013 Summer 1: TA for IN4MATX 131: Human-Computer Interaction</li>\n\t\t<li>2012 Spring: TA for IN4MATX 45: Patterns of Software Construction</li>\n\t\t<li>2012 Spring: TA for IN4MATX 123: Software Architecture</li>\n\t\t<li>2012 Winter: TA for IN4MATX 117: Project in Software System Design</li>\n\t\t<li>2011 Fall: TA for ICS 10: How Computers Work</li>\n\t    </ul>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <div class=\"sectionHeader\" id=\"working\">Working Experience</div>\n        <p>\n\t    <ul>\n\t\t<li>2008 - 2011\tDatacom (www.datacom.co.nz), Auckland, New Zealand</li>\n\t\t<li>2007 - 2008\tHyro (www.hyro.com), Auckland, New Zealand</li>\n\t\t<li>2005 - 2007\tIntergen (www.intergen.co.nz), Auckland, New Zealand</li>\n\t    </ul>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <div class=\"sectionHeader\" id=\"interests\">Other Interests</div>\n        <p>Love travelling (who doesn't!).
