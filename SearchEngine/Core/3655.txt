We\ngeneralize hyperplane regression depth to k-flats for any k between\n0 and d-1. The k=0 case gives the classical notion of center\npoints. We prove that for any k and d, deep k-flats exist, that is,\nfor any set of n points there always exists a k-flat with depth at\nleast a constant fraction of n. As a consequence, we derive a\nlinear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the deepest\nflat.</p>\n\n<p>(To appear at SCG'00; full paper available in <a href= \n\"http://arXiv.org/abs/cs.CG/9912013\">ACM Computing Research\nRepository, cs.CG/9912013</a>.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3655.0}
