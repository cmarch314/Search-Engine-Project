Both of\nthese data structures can support efficient search operations as well as\nrange queries.  The talk will include definitions of the two data\nstructures, an outline of their fundamental routines, and a discussion of\ntheir theoretical performance.  \n\n<p>\nThe content of the talk is taken from the following two papers:<br>\n\"Skip Graphs\" by James Aspnes and Gauri Shah, appeared in SODA 2003<br>\n\"Family Trees\" by Kevin C.
