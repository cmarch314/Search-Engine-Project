to continue on the next line E g A 1 2 3 4 A semicolon at the end of a statement means that Matlab will not display the result of the evaluated statement If the is omitted then Matlab will display the result This is also useful for printing the value of variables e g A Matlab s command line is a little like a standard shell Use the up arrow to recall commands without retyping them and down arrow to go forward in the command history C a moves to beginning of line C e for end C f moves forward a character and C b moves back equivalent to the left and right arrow keys C d deletes a character C k deletes the rest of the line to the right of the cursor C p goes back through the command history and C n goes forward equivalent to up and down arrows Tab tries to complete a command Simple debugging If the command dbstop if error is issued before running a script or a function that causes a run time error the execution will stop at the point where the error occurred Very useful for tracking down errors 2 Basic types in Matlab A The basic types in Matlab are scalars usually double precision floating point vectors and matrices A 1 2 3 4 Creates a 2x2 matrix B 1 2 3 4 The simplest way to create a matrix is to list its entries in square brackets The symbol separates rows the optional separates columns N 5 A scalar v 1 A row vector v 1 2 3 A column vector v v Transpose a vector row to column or column to row v 1 5 3 A vector filled in a specified range v pi 4 4 4 start stepsize end brackets are optional v Empty vector B Creating special matrices 1ST parameter is ROWS 2ND parameter is COLS m zeros 2 3 Creates a 2x3 matrix of zeros v ones 1 3 Creates a 1x3 matrix row vector of ones m eye 3 Identity matrix 3x3 v rand 3 1 Randomly filled 3x1 matrix column vector see also randn But watch out m zeros 3 Creates a 3x3 matrix of zeros C Indexing vectors and matrices Warning Indices always start at 1 and NOT at v 1 2 3 v 3 Access a vector element m 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 8 9 1 11 12 13 14 15 16 m 1 3 Access a matrix element matrix ROW COLUMN m 2 Access a whole matrix row 2nd row m 1 Access a whole matrix column 1st column m 1 1 3 Access elements 1 through 3 of the 1st row m 2 3 2 Access elements 2 through 3 of the 2nd column m 2 end 3 Keyword end accesses the remainder of a column or row m 1 2 3 4 5 6 size m Returns the size of a matrix size m 1 Number of rows size m 2 Number of columns m1 zeros size m Create a new matrix with the size of m who List variables in workspace whos List variables w info about size type etc 3 Simple operations on vectors and matrices A Element wise operations These operations are done element by element If two vectors matrices are to be added subtracted or element wise multiplied or divided they must have the same size a 1 2 3 4 A column vector 2 a Scalar multiplication a 4 Scalar division b 5 6 7 8 Another column vector a b Vector addition a b Vector subtraction a 2 Element wise squaring note the a b Element wise multiplication note the a b Element wise division note the log 1 2 3 4 Element wise logarithm round 1 5 2 2 2 3 1 Element wise rounding to nearest integer Other element wise arithmetic operations include e g floor ceil B Vector Operations Built in Matlab functions that operate on vectors a 1 4 6 3 A row vector sum a Sum of vector elements mean a Mean of vector elements var a Variance of elements std a Standard deviation max a Maximum min a Minimum If a matrix is given then these functions will operate on each column of the matrix and return a row vector as result a 1 2 3 4 5 6 A matrix mean a Mean of each column max a Max of each column max max a Obtaining the max of a matrix mean a 2 Mean of each row second argument specifies dimension along which operation is taken 1 2 3 4 5 6 1x3 row vector times a 3x1 column vector results in a scalar Known as dot product or inner product Note the absence of 1 2 3 4 5 6 3x1 column vector times a 1x3 row vector results in a 3x3 matrix Known as outer product Note the absence of C Matrix Operations a rand 3 2 A 3x2 matrix b rand 2 4 A 2x4 matrix c a b Matrix product results in a 3x4 matrix a 1 2 3 4 5 6 A 3x2 matrix b 5 6 7 A 1x3 row vector b a Vector matrix product results in a 1x2 row vector c 8 9 A 2x1 column vector a c Matrix vector product results in a 3x1 column vector a 1 3 2 6 5 4 7 8 9 A 3x3 matrix inv a Matrix inverse of a eig a Vector of eigenvalues of a V D eig a D matrix with eigenvalues on diagonal V matrix of eigenvectors Example for multiple return values U S V svd a Singular value decomposition of a a U S V singular values are stored in S Other matrix operations det norm rank D Reshaping and assembling matrices a 1 2 3 4 5 6 A 3x2 matrix b a Make 6x1 column vector by stacking up columns of a sum a Useful sum of all elements a reshape b 2 3 Make 2x3 matrix out of vector elements column wise a 1 2 b 3 4 Two row vectors c a b Horizontal concatenation see horzcat a 1 2 3 Column vector c a 4 Vertical concatenation see vertcat a eye 3 rand 3 Concatenation for matrices b eye 3 ones 1 3 b repmat 5 3 2 Create a 3x2 matrix of fives b repmat 1 2 3 4 1 2 Replicate the 2x2 matrix twice in column direction makes 2x4 matrix b diag 1 2 3 Create 3x3 diagonal matrix with given diagonal elements 4 Control statements vectorization Syntax of control flow statements for VARIABLE EXPR STATEMENT STATEMENT end EXPR is a vector here e g 1 1 or 1 5 1 or 1 4 7 while EXPRESSION STATEMENTS end if EXPRESSION STATEMENTS elseif EXPRESSION STATEMENTS else STATEMENTS end elseif and else clauses are optional the end is required EXPRESSIONs are usually made of relational clauses e g a b The operators are almost like in C Warning Loops run very slowly in Matlab because of interpretation overhead This has gotten somewhat better in version 6 5 but you should nevertheless try to avoid them by vectorizing the computation i e by rewriting the code in form of matrix operations This is illustrated in some examples below Examples for i 1 2 7 Loop from 1 to 7 in steps of 2 i Print i end for i 5 13 1 Loop over given vector if i 1 Sample if statement disp Larger than 1 Print given string elseif i Parentheses are optional disp Negative value else disp Something else end end Here is another example given an mxn matrix A and a 1xn vector v we want to subtract v from every row of A m 5 n 1 A ones m n v 2 rand 1 n Implementation using loops for i 1 m A i A i v end We can compute the same thing using only matrix operations A ones m n repmat v m 1 This version of the code runs much faster We can vectorize the computation even when loops contain conditional statements Example given an mxn matrix A create a matrix B of the same size containing all zeros and then copy into B the elements of A that are greater than zero Implementation using loops B zeros m n for i 1 m for j 1 n if A i j B i j A i j end end end All this can be computed w o any loop B zeros m n ind find A Find indices of positive elements of A see help find for more info B ind A ind Copies into B only the elements of A that are 5 Saving your work save myfile Saves all workspace variables into file myfile mat save myfile a b Saves only variables a and b clear a b Removes variables a and b from the workspace clear Clears the entire workspace load myfile Loads variable s from myfile mat 6 Creating scripts or functions using m files Matlab scripts are files with m extension containing Matlab commands Variables in a script file are global and will change the value of variables of the same name in the environment of the current Matlab session A script with name script1 m can be invoked by typing script1 in the command window Functions are also m files The first line in a function file must be of this form function outarg 1 outarg m myfunction inarg 1 inarg n The function name should be the same as that of the file i e function myfunction should be saved in file myfunction m Have a look at myfunction m and myotherfunction m for examples Functions are executed using local workspaces there is no risk of conflicts with the variables in the main workspace At the end of a function execution only the output arguments will be visible in the main workspace a 1 2 3 4 Global variable a b myfunction 2 a Call myfunction which has local variable a a Global variable a is unchanged c d myotherfunction a b Call myotherfunction with two return values 7
