{"text": "JEWS IN CRACOW AT THE TIME OF THE CONFEDERACY OF BAR 1768 72 By MAJER BALABAN Originally published in Yivo Hijtorijbe Shrifin ii 1937 One of the saddest chapters in the history of Cracow is the period of the Confederacy of Bar 1768 72 For decades afterwards old people used to recall those terrible days when the city frequently changed hands and the soldiers both Russian and Bar plundered shops set fire to the suburbs and even to the houses in the city took as prisoners either real or supposed followers of the enemy and through oppressive extortions and forced deliveries squeezed the last pennies out of merchants artisans and even clergy For Jews this period was even more terrible than for the other citizens Both the Russians and the Confederates considered the Jews as enemies from the start Without mercy they hung Jews on branches of trees Both sides demanded heavy deliveries of bread and meat quartering of soldiers and also armed help and espionage service Even before this confederacy i e during the time of the Radom Confederacy and before the time that the Warsaw Sejm upon the order of Repnin had decided to give equal rights to the dissenters the followers of the old order attempted to prevent this through various means Priests denounced equal rights from their pulpits as the act of the devil and attempted through defamatory pamphlets to undermine Repnin s aims One such satire is the Manifesto of the Confederated Israelite Nobility of the Foreign Nations of the Former Inhabitants of Jerusalem It was distributed by special messengers among various cities and was also copied from hand to hand In this manifesto the Jews supposedly complain that while the rights of nobility and equal rights are being given to Lutherans and Orthodox they the ancient Jerusalem nobility older than any other are omitted In order to provide a semblance of veracity to this complaint the author depicts the Jews as complaining of their unhappy condition and the way in which they are despised by various circles among the people No one has respect for us they say On the contrary only too frequently does each one of us have a stone from a Christian lad fly by our head The pamphlet is set in the chancery style of the Polish documents of the Jewish councils even though the Councils of the Lands had ceased to exist since 1764 This pamphlet was only a political anecdote Following it came the tragic reality the Confederacy of Bar Immediately after it was started in Bar the news reached Cracow Specially manufactured newspapers dated Warsaw were distributed throughout the city Residents read with gusto of the victories of the Confederates over the Russians of the triumphs of Pulawski over Padgorichanin Kretchnikov and Apraksin and readily believed them They inwardly suppressed their enmity to their age old enemies and their allies on the Polish throne In time the nobility of the Cracow region was divided into supporters and opponents of the Confederation and they battled with each other in the Proszow Sejmik The townspeople and the Jews stood in between and awaited whatever time and the future would bring Soon the report came to the Cracow Town Hall that the Confederates were routed and that Bar and Berdichev were captured To the Jewish town hall in Kazimierz came the report of the slaughter at Urnan in which almost all the Jews of the town were killed There was not too much time to meditate on these happenings On June 2 1768 the wojewodztwo of the Confederation of Cracow was organized and it selected as marshall the well known play boy and profilgate Michal Czarnocki the owner of Secymin The very next day the Confederates took over the Cracow garrison The town administration thereupon swore allegiance without hesitation to Czarnocki Only the town mayor Piotr Szaster laid down his post These formalities were hardly completed when Russian troops appeared outside the city and shooting began at the Slawkowska gate In order to protect the city from sudden attack Czarnocki ordered the city gates to be closed during the day and he introduced special passes for those who had business outside the city gates This immediately affected the Jews who lived in Kazimierz but had their stores and warehouses in Cracow Only a few succeeded in securing passes The great majority could not get into Cracow and the Jewish shops therefore remained closed for a long period Meanwhile the Russians under Apraksin and Prozorovski encircled the city with an increasingly tight cordon They cut off the supply of food and captured the small groups of Confederates who had rushed to the aid of their comrades Nevertheless the siege lasted for eight weeks The orders of Repnin intended to hasten the end of the war were of no avail He advised the use of spies and Jews In order to force the Jews into submission he suggested that they be threatened with exile deep into Russia or hanging upon the first suitable branch Soon hunger began to be felt in Cracow The burghers demanded that the city surrender The Confederates losing more and more every day attributed all their defeats to treason and searched for spies everywhere Several spies were hung in the market place among them also Jews Among those hung was Ciszek the officer of the town garrison who was accused of being in contact with the Russians The go between was alleged to be Isaac of Kazimierz a Jew from Sacz who used to meet with a Cossack officer in the Kazimierz synagogue This allegation was reported by a memoir writer of the time and has been repeated uncritically by all subsequent historians who did not stop to reflect that in July 1768 Kazimierz was still in the hands of the Confederates When Czarnocki saw that he would not be able to hold Cracow he ordered the Jews to supply 6 men Weeping they told him that there were altogether only 1 5 souls in the empty Jewish city and he ordered them to pay 8 zlotys within a week The Jews began to bargain with him and he became impatient He ordered the parnes of the community Fayvush Giesser to be seized and his head beard and ear locks to be shaved He threatened to do the same to others if one penny were missing from the sum he set The Jews temporarily paid several thousand zlotys they were relieved of paying the rest by the Russians who captured Kazimierz and the Jewish quarter on August 1 1768 The Russians used Kazimierz as operations base to storm Cracow during the following two weeks During this period they used Jews to build trenches and bury their dead They also quartered their soldiers in Jewish homes On August 17 the Russians entered Cracow After they had driven the Confederates deep into Russia they made themselves comfortable in the city They imposed heavy tribute upon the population and threatened hanging for the slightest provocation Drevich carried on more wildly than any other He would continue to dispatch contingents of troops to capture the fortresses in the neighborhood Tyniec Lanckorona and Czestochowa The permanent Cracow commandant Lobry was more humane The townspeople became intimate with him and Jews also had access to him They served as purveyors for him and sought his help in their struggle with their own co religionists for control of the community The rich Cracow Jew Israel Aronovich purveyor of the mint became a factor for Lobry He loaned huge sums to Lobry as well as to the later commandants and these loans were at the expense of the Cracow Jewish community The Russians remained in Cracow a whole year On September 3 they liquidated their command and left the city in order to storm Czgstochowa the strongest fortress of the Confederates Before they retired they ordered the Jews to pay 7 zlotys for the supplies they were leaving behind in the Wawel warehouse These supplies had been delivered by Jewish purveyors who had not been paid for them Now the Jewish community had to pay the required sum and the supplies thereupon were taken over by the Confederates who occupied Cracow on September 13 A new series of requisitions and forced deliveries of goods grain and wood now began Marshal Dzierzanowski had captured the Wieliczka mines without a shot and he imposed upon the merchants craft guilds clergy and Jews the obligation to buy 1 barrels of salt at a very high price On the very first day he extracted 18 zlotys from various individuals Others paid for the salt later In return however they only received paper money which lost its value when the Confederates again abandoned Cracow On November 9 1769 the Confederates abandoned the city The Russians returned and remained there until June 1772 when the first partition of Poland took place For two full years the impoverished and sacked city had to support the Muscovite troops who continued to carry out attacks in various directions At the same time the inhabitants also suffered from diversionary attacks made from time to time by the Confederates Thus on November 26 1769 the hussars of Trzebinski and Paszkowski attacked the Jewish quarter The Russian soldiers were then in the Jewish bathhouse Many were hacked to death and others taken away as prisoners The Jews because they had taken care of the Russians paid for it with the plundering of their shops and warehouses Such attacks were repeated many times during the course of the winter of 1769 7 as on January 17 177 March 1 and March 4 On each occasion the Confederates plundered the Jews or took them as prisoners The summer of 177 was relatively calm But the diversions and attacks were renewed in the winter of 177 71 On January 13 the Confederates attacked Kazimierz managed to reach the house of the commandant Major Orszakow killed some of his men and took others prisoner Then they attacked Cracow They were not successful and therefore also abandoned Kazimierz They thereupon plundered the Jewish homes and dealt with the Jews in so godless a manner that it seemed incredible to the correspondent of the Hildesheimer Relationskurrier The same correspondent estimated the Jewish damage of that day at 3 zlotys Even though this sum is obviously exaggerated it does testify to the great damage suffered by the Jews A few days later Paszkowski s and Schutz s divisions repeated the attack on Kazimierz They caught many Jews and dragged them off Many of them were hung on the way Twelve others among them the parnes Gutman Rakowski were incarcerated in Lanckorona and Wieliczka and 12 zlotys were demanded as ransom money Rakowski could not endure the beating he was subjected to upon his arrest on the way When he felt he was dying he called Israel Davidovich and Levi Jakhimovich and dictated his will in their presence From this we learn of the sufferings he endured in prison how his home in the Jewish quarter was destroyed papers worth more than 2 zlotys torn up and how by whips they extracted from him the bit of cash he had taken with him on the road Rakowski died in Lanckorona on June 18 1771 When his wife learned of the death of her husband she gathered together her last pennies and at great risk came to Lanckorona in order to redeem his body The Confederates however refused to lower the price they had previously set They released only several of the Jews and kept the others in prison It is also very interesting that during this time there was a Jew who instead of helping his brothers sought to make a fortune out of the Jewish tragedy This was Nakhman of Kalwarja the factor of Korytowski and purveyor to Prince Czartoryski The families of the captured Jews addressed a request to him that he intervene with the Confederates in their behalf Through him too they sent food and money for their unfortunate relatives Nakhman mercilessly took the money for himself and in addition he persuaded Korytowski to increase the rental fee for his grey house in Cracow notwithstanding the explicit prohibition by the Prince The last heroic act of the Confederates was the capture of the Wawel Castle Here they remained several months During this period one of their divisions again plundered the Jewish quarter and dragged off a number of Jews as prisoners These were kept for several months in the Wieliczka prison in hunger and cold A Jew Aron Wielitchker who allied himself with the Confederates helped make their lot worse On May 5 1772 at the end of the Confederate period the Cracow Jewish community excommunicated Nakhman But the unfortunate prisoners continued to be held At this time the partition treaty of the three great powers had already been signed The foreign troops pecked at the living body of the Polish state like birds of prey Because of the vague formulation of the treaty the Austrians took over Kazimierz and with it the Jewish quarter while the Poles retained Cracow The Jews of Cracow suddenly became subjects of Her Royal Majesty Maria Theresa They submitted to their new rulers a list of the damages they had suffered at the hands of the Russians and the Confederates Jewish individuals suffered damages to the amount of 288 131 zlotys The community according to the oath of the parnosim also had incurred expenses These they estimated at 13 zlotys Together the sum amounted to 418 131 zlotys This was the flag under which the history of Cracow Jews proceeded in those days of plagues when every month if not every day brought with it new restrictive orders and troubles and when the Jewish quarter was a battlefield commanded now by the Russians now by the Confederates Not one house in the city emerged intact Most of the stores were plundered and the community itself including its parnosim was oppressed and disgraced These parnosim and their syndics lived as on a volcano Every minute they were called or dragged to another officer To each one they had to bow their heads appease him and stuff him with gold unless they wanted to be hung on the first good branch of a tree or be hacked to death in the gateway of their own house It is therefore no wonder that the parnosim took money from whatever source they could They would extort some from members of the community some they would borrow at exorbitant rates of interest often up to 4 percent During the early period of the Confederacy of Bar the following parnosim stood at the head of the community without interruption and without elections Fayvush Giesser Gutman Rakowski Dr Mendl Kalahora all allied with the well known Jekeles family This family was represented in the council of the community by the old Moyshe Jekeles who was looked upon as the head of the community The Jekeles family and their allies ruled over the Cracow community for over 15 years Jewish families declined and new ones rose to power Jews became rich and Jews became poor but the Jekeles family continued to hold communal power They had to endure more than one battle to maintain their control which they looked upon as a hereditary power The fortune of the family came to be divided up There were rich members of the family and poor ones Our Moyshe was of the poor ones Notwithstanding his modest fortune and his old age which made him bent and hunch backed he possessed a firm spirit and the pride of an aristocrat and he stood up courageously against the machinations of his opponents Gutman Rakowski occupied the leading place in the Jekeles faction Rakowski s grandfather had occupied a communal post In 1745 his father Berl Rakowski was among the tuvim and he himself became that year one of the community councilors mezy or dziewiecmezy During the years 1756 61 in the struggle between the Jewish and non Jewish merchants Berl was also one of the tuvim and all his goods were confiscated at that time This affected him so deeply that he became ill and soon died His son Gutman took over his business as well as his debts It was this Gutman who died in Lanckorona as a prisoner of the Confederates Dr Mendl Kalahora came from a well known Sephardic family His father Dr Aron Kalahora was the first Jew to receive a diploma from the Cracow Academy Fayvush Giesser was a new figure in Cracow He came from Zolkiew He married in Cracow and thanks to his family connections soon became parnes In 1767 we find him in this post together with Hershl Stobnitzki one of the most powerful of the Cracow Jews These two had attempted to smooth over the trouble between the arrendator of liquor taxes Leizer Melekhiovich and the trustee of the hekdesh i e the head of the charity committee Jonah Rabinovich The incident was trivial but it created a great stir Melekhovich was arrendator of liquor taxes and he prevented the Jews from selling liquor in their taverns That is why he was hated in the towns Because he feared revenge Leizer induced the provincial government to take him out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish community court and to provide him with a letter of protection The community wanted to play a prank on him in return and it permitted one of its members Jonah Rabinovich to rent Leizer s pew in the old synagogue Leizer became infuriated at the community and went to the officer of the Kazimierz garrison Antoni Eismond who brought back to Jonah the money he paid for Leizer s pew Jonah in turn turned the money over to the trustees of the hekdesh the pew belonged to them and then Eismond with military escort came to the meeting of the trustees read them the letter of the wojewoda and demanded to know if they were ready to obey the commands of the wojewoda and respect the protective documents he issued The trustees were not overawed by the officer s threats and immediately turned the case over to the Jewish court The latter excommunicated Leizer and ordered him jailed The sextons took Leizer to the jail next to the synagogue while Eismond s soldiers took Jonah Rabinovich into custody and put him into the wojewoda jail i e in the local prison Fayvush Giesser parnes of the community saw the danger in the situation and intervened He invited Eismond to the home of the rabbi where Hershl Stobnitzki and Dr Kalahara were already waiting Unexpectedly Jonah arrived too He had gotten out of jail He punched Eismond in the nose several times The latter fainted and was revived by the rabbi s wife The whole affair was so strange that it came to the wojewoda court After listening to testimony the court decreed that Jonah Rabinovich was to be imprisoned for six months and was not to occupy any public post for six years Hershl Stobnitzki was sentenced to two weeks in prison and was barred from public office for three years Jonah was so broken up by this sentence that he never again served as a parnes Stobnitzki emerged again a few years later Both however could not be selected at the next communal election and they were replaced by in addition to Kalahora and Giesser Rakowski Israel Aronovich and as usual by one of the Jekeles family Moyshe Jekeles Even before the arrival of the Confederates these parnosim had had great difficulties in collecting taxes and in covering the communal debts that had reached astronomical proportions When the Confederates arrived pillaging and hanging again set in Soon the Russians came and Capt Lobry assumed command of the Cracow garrison Aronovich also known as Menashe s became an intimate of his He was made a purveyor for the Russian army and came to have a powerful influence in the Jewish community and even in the city of Cracow Israel it is true used his influence for the benefit of the Jewish population but he did not mind spending communal money in order to satisfy the military He made loans at high interest rates and imposed increasingly high consumers taxes which poisoned the life of the already impoverished Cracow Jewry By these methods Israel managed to win over Lobry to his side and also his successors Oebelschwitz and Stahremberg and together with his four friends automatically occupied the posts of parnosim for four continuous years without rendering account to anyone over this long period Against Jekeles five and his plunder economy protests came from the Stobnitzkis officially the father Moyshe and behind the scenes his son Hersh Shimen Bass Moyshe Braciejowski and later the purveyor of the Warsaw mint Fayvush Abrahamovich who thanks to his position was relieved of payments and had the right to buy up silver coins throughout the country Fayvush Abrahamovich came from Przedborz and was apparently a relative or in law of the famous Landau family Around 175 he came to Cracow and there married the daughter of a rich Jew Avigdor ben Moyshe Gumprecht Avigdor had been a parnes for several years but he had a bad reputation His father had also been a parnes in the second decade of the 18th century but he was unable to give proper accounting of the public funds and he landed in the wojewoda prison in 1728 In order to secure his release he extorted from the community secretary Joshua Horowitz a written declaration that he had returned to him all accounts and receipts as well as the 4 zlotys cash which he had been accused of appropriating Horowitz gave Moyshe such a declaration but on March 21 1728 he withdrew it in the presence of the syndic and vice syndic and had his withdrawal recorded in the wojewoda books Avigdor was no better than his father But a more interesting type was his son in law Fayvush Abrahamovich He won the sympathy of the opposition elements in the community The enemies of the Jekeles faction authorized him to induce the Russian authorities to set the drawing of lots for the intermediate days of Passover Faysush began with a clever trick He took advantage of the fact that Moyshe Jekeles was old that Israel Aronovich was away on business to Warsaw and that others were absent from the city or were imprisoned by the Confederates so that only Dr Mendl Kalahora could come to the community house and called together a meeting of some fifty Jews of the town on February 2 1772 They passed the following resolution In view of the fact of the oppression and the sad state of the community of Kazimierz near Cracow because of the times of plagues because of all kinds of armies everywhere and just because of this we endure suffering every minute and every hour that cannot be recorded on paper and especially because our city has become empty and we can no longer bear the burdens and there is no help or support to come from anywhere we therefore have with God s help decided not to allow that the Jews be scattered from the city and we have decided to select several people to complete the number of roshim heads missing on the kahal board inspectors of accounts roei heshbonot hekdesh trustees and nine kahal men These newly selected men must be ready at any moment to help the tuvim optimates control the schedule of duties and take measures to collect them It seems likely that the opposition was more interested in control than in aid But the incumbent parnosim did not want to agree to this and luck was with them the very same day the Confederates captured the Wawel Castle shooting began and there was no opportunity for discussion Fayrush Abrahamovich did not give up Thirsting for revenge against the Jekeles faction he paid no attention to personal dangers nor to material damages and he determined to crush all obstacles in order to carry through new elections and secure the kahal mandates for himself and for his supporters Since Rzewuski the Cracow wojewoda was a prisoner of the Russians it was necessary to appeal to the highest authorities in Warsaw to get permission to carry through the elections Fayvush therefore went to Warsaw He succeeded in winning over the chancellor Father Mlodziejowski and the latter invited the Russian General Waynmarn and several staff officers to dinner several times in order to get them to permit the elections for the Cracow kahal Waynmarn issued the appropriate order to the Cracow commandant Oebelschwitz and the latter immediately gave his consent to issue such a permit He only expressed his unofficial opinion that the new kahal council would be adapted to the demands of the Russian army both in respect to loyalty and in respect to supplies transport spies and the like In order to assure the commandant of his loyalty Fayvush gave him as he later testified 5 zlotys Before he received the rescript for the elections however Oebelschwitz left his post and was succeeded by Capt Stahremberg Stahremberg also adhered to the view of his predecessor regarding the benefits which the Russian command had derived from the old kahal and had planned to make such a report to his superiors But Fayvush anticipated this and sent him a present certainly not out of his own pocket of 2 ducats In his notes on this Fayvush added the interesting comment that Stahremberg had yielded only after much pleading and importuning But when he took the 2 ducats he had done him a great favor because he could have had he wanted taken three times as much from the old parnosim Armed with Stahremberg s permit Fayvush now played the role of a formalist and decided to carry out the drawing of lots in accordance with law with the assistance of the Jewish judge The Jewish judge Kurdwanowski a well known adherent of the Confederates lived in hiding outside Cracow Fayvush turned to Sebastjan Badeni the judge of the Cracow castle and inspector of the mint to get him into the Jewish quarter in Kazimierz and to intervene with the commandant of the city Badeni undertook the mission for the price of 1 ducats He invited Stahremberg to lunch and secured from him a safe conduct for a short term Protected by such a safe conduct the Jewish judge arrived in Kazimierz He collected 1 ducats however for his expenses and labors New elections were now held for the kahal The old council was deposed and Fayvush Abrahamovich Hershl Stobnitzki and their supporters were elected as the new parnosim As soon as it was constituted the new kahal carried out an examination of the accounts of the preceding four years At the same time it issued an announcement calling upon all who had any information to declare on oath in what ways they had been wronged by Israel Aronovich and his friends In order to annoy him further Fayvush had Israel put into the pillory in the old synagogue and then he issued a very severe sentence upon him which was pronounced in the same synagogue with black candles and with the call of the shofar While listening to the verdict Israel stood bound in heavy chains and his pew in the synagogue was draped in black as for one who had died After the ceremony Israel was paraded through the city to the jail When his mother an old lady of 7 tried to approach him Fayvush pushed her away with such force that she fell to the earth and fainted Israel remained in prison for several weeks Only when his wife brought Fayvush cash and securities valued at 3 ducats was he released and he had to swear that he would not seek satisfaction in the state courts At the same time he signed a declaration that he had given Fayrush the 3 ducats of his own good will and without pressure No sooner had Israel left the walls of the jail than he proceeded immediately to Cracow dispatched a thundering protest to the regional court and hired horses to go to Warsaw to seek the aid of his protectors Fayvush heard of all this immediately and he ordered Israel s wife to summon her husband to the Jewish quarter When she refused he ordered Israel to be excommunicated the following Sabbath and had the ban proclaimed in six synagogues To wreak his vengeance still further he had Israel s wife roused out of bed and with an escort of 15 night watchmen carrying lanterns taken to the old synagogue to hear the excommunication proclaimed against her husband Fayvush also vented his rage on Israel s daughter he took away from her fiance the securities which her father had deposited for her dowry Israel knew of all that was going on His good friends informed him how Fayvush was maltreating his wife and daughter and insulting him and his near ones He therefore spared no money or energy to gain access to the occupying powers With the aid of friends among the nobility he secured an order to Stahremberg from the Russian General Bibikov that the investigation of the quarrel between the former and present parnosim of the kahal be reopened Bibikov also ordered that two ranking Russian officers participate in the investigation Fayvush Abrahamovich was afraid of the reopening of the investigation especially since he did not know how the Russian officers would behave Through the intervention of Badeni he secured permission to have two Polish officers at the hearing of testimony The commission thus included Major Artzybashev and a captain name unknown from the Russian side the Jewish judge Kurdwanowski and the sub delegate from Cracow Krowicki for the Polish side Fayvush bribed them all He even sent gifts to the investigators and the secretaries He derived little benefit from it however Major Artzybashev sent the record of the proceedings to Stahremberg and the latter sent it immediately to General von Roenne at Lublin No one in Cracow knew who was in charge of civil affairs in the Russian command in Lublin Fayvush therefore sent a special messenger to secure this information It turned out that the civil commissioner was Major Hoshan Lobry s former aide and a good friend of Fayvush Fayvush despatched 2 ducats to win him over to his side Without even reading the records Hoshan returned them to Cracow with an order to Stahremberg that he deal with the matter himself Stahrenberg turned the dossier over to the reporter Piotr Szaster the former mayor of Cracow and now an official in the commandatura Szaster examined the whole case recognized Fayvush s guilt and ordered him to pay 2 ducats to Israel and 1 to the Jewish community Fayvush was not successful this time in making an appeal He was immediately taken into custody and forced to pay the above mentioned sums He was detained even after payment until further word came from higher channels first from Moscow then from Prussia and finally from Austria Just at this time the Russians left Cracow and Kazimierz and turned the cities over to the Prussians The latter also left soon and on June 11 1772 both cities were occupied by Austrian troops Later the Austrians left Cracow but retained Kazimierz which is on the right bank of the Vistula General D Alton set up his command headquarters first in Wieliczka later in Tarnow Only the district office was left in Wieliczka and the commanding officer there was Joseph von Baum The members of the former kahal quickly oriented themselves to the situation Taking advantage of the fact that Fayvush was still in jail they sent Israel to Wieliczka to sound out the new rulers Israel was able to reach D Alton and he gave him his version of the whole matter D Alton not having the slightest notion of what had been going on in the city for years immediately dispatched his lieutenant auditor Mansack to Cracow and gave him Dobrowolski as aide The latter soon became the Jewish judge for the Austrians Mansack treated Fayvush as a criminal He was kept in jail and sent to court and to the investigating magistrate under guard The gifts which Fayvusli sent to both officials were of no avail Mansack assembled all the Jews in the synagogue ordered the old kahal deposed and a new one elected The new one consisted for the most part of the Jekeles faction Finally Fayvush got out of jail He immediately charged Mansack with taking bribes and bringing harm to the Austrian authority D Alton had Mansack arrested but he took no action on the matter itself but transferred it to Lemberg To Lemberg therefore went Avigdor the father in law of Fayvush and he succeeded in having the matter directed temporarily to Wieliczka for further investigation In the meantime Shloyme Rabinovich son in law of Moyshe Jekeles delivered to Emperor Joseph ein alluntertanigstes Immediatgesuch in which he described in detail the robberies and bribes of the incumbent kahal elders Joseph II turned over the request to the Lemberg authorities and the governor appointed a commission to investigate the charges This was the beginning of Austrian rule in Kazimierz During this terrible period a time of civil war and of conflicts between Jewish factions the fight also continued between the Jews and the Kazimierz magistrates concerning the right to trade in the Jewish town and also with the Cracow magistrates concerning trade and work in Cracow The constitution of 1768 had declared that in those cities where there were no agreements with the Jews commercial agreements be made with them It did not indicate however who was to take the initiative what sort of agreements they were to be and what was to be done if the authorities did not want to make such an agreement The matter was given some attention in Cracow and in Kazimierz but no progress was made because just at that time in 1768 Cracow was occupied first by the Confederates and then by the Russians When the Russian occupation continued on however and the Jews in Cracow once again opened their shops and warehouses and some of them did quite well with military supplies the municipal authorities remembered their old headache and once again entered charges against the Jews in the Assessor s Court in Warsaw On June 3 1769 the trial opened The municipal authorities were represented by Jan Nepomucen Slominski the Jewish community by Antoni Opelewski The court postponed the case because both sides had failed to present their documents in time The case was resumed over a year later on November 7 177 This time the municipality was represented by Pawel Bialobrzeski and the Jews again by Opelewski Opelewski proposed the agreement of 16 9 which Wladyslaw IV had confirmed in 163 and which stipulated that in case of conflict the Jews were to come not under the jurisdiction of the Assessors Court but under that of the wojewoda Bialobrzeski appealed to the constitution of 1764 and claimed that the Assessors Court was competent to try the case The court agreed with the conclusions of the lawyer for the Jews and sent the case to the Cracow wojewoda with the comment that he should see to it that the litigants arrange a commercial agreement between them with the right of appeal to the Assessor s Court Unfortunately for the Jews the Cracow wojewoda Rzewuski was a prisoner of the Russians and the Jewish judge Kurdwanowski a supporter of the Confederates was in hiding in the suburbs of the city There was no authority therefore that could take the case in hand and the officials took advantage of this and began on their own to shut down Jewish shops and to confiscate the goods The Jews thereupon hastened to Commandant Oebelschwitz and he in turn sent a letter to his superior General Waynmarn in Warsaw inquiring what he should do in the matter Waynmarn forbade the Cracow commandant to interfere in a matter which was not his concern Meanwhile the municipal officials were able to secure from King Stanislaw August December 8 177 a confirmation of the decree of 175 of August III which forbade the Jews from carrying on trade in Cracow The city officials immediately called the Jewish elders to the Town Hall read the decree to them and ordered them immediately to close up their shops and cease their trade On December 17 177 the Jews entered a protest and on December 29 they submitted a memorandum that the city officials had again begun to confiscate Jewish property as in the years 1742 1761 The city officials paid scant attention to the protests and on January 3 1771 they publicly proclaimed the royal decree and continued to confiscate Jewish goods although a bit more cautiously They were cautious because they did not know how the occupying power would view the matter and Waynmarn s instructions to Oebelschwitz were not known in the city There was a series of protests and counter protests until the matter came back to the Assessor s Court The Christian party sought to hasten the trial the Jews to delay it The Russian army in Kazimierz was forcing the Jews to repair the city and at the same time the Jews could not gain access to their archives and get the needed documents The Jewish parnosim could not leave the city to go to intervene in Warsaw They had to stand guard over their person and property The Jewish community appealed on February 26 1771 to the chancellor Father Mlodziejowski and he intervened by asking the Cracow magistrate to conclude any sort of peace with the Jews The Jews also addressed themselves to the town president that out of respect for the letter of protection of the chancellor he should be inclined toward peace The president was persuaded and he called upon the Jews to present their trade proposals He set the condition however that the basis for the negotiations should be the sacramental agreement of 1485 Finally on July 31 and August 1 1771 the kahal parnosim submitted an extensive memorial In it they described their critical financial situation the debts of the kahal and of individual merchants and also the various imperial and kahal taxes all of which weighed most heavily upon them From this memorial it appears that the Jews owed the shlakhta and the Polish townsmen about 85 zlotys The debt to the foreign merchants amounted to over 1 thaler In order to meet the kahal obligations they indicated that they needed 13 8 zlotys annually which they derived from the members of the community by direct taxes and consumer taxes In order to carry this burden they had to have a source of income and only trade could serve as such The Jews of Cracow had engaged in trade since the most ancient times notwithstanding the interference of the gentile merchants They asked therefore not for new rights or liberties but only that sanction be given to the actual condition At the same time they wished to restrict their trade only to the most necessary goods and they yielded the trade in luxury goods to the Christian merchants The Jews demanded the right to trade in the following wares 1 white goods linen canvass etc 2 woolen goods cloth Dutch

to all that no changes were involved in the trade relations in the city The deliberations dragged on and they diligently studied the agreements of 16 9 and 1615 and analogous agreements in Lemberg and Posen Finally they sent an agreement to the lawyer in Warsaw It was signed by Feistmantel Florkowski Bajer and others The agreement set forth that Jews were permitted to trade with the following wares in Cracow shops and warehouses being forbidden however to distribute them to courts of nobles churches and to the suburbs The list included 1 foreign linens of various kinds white striped cotton tick coarse linen Silesian Fustian to be sold only by the piece and not by the yard since there were many stores that bought by the piece and sold at a profit by the yard 2 muslins table cloths napkins

the cap makers gild stood on its rights 2 the wares must be first inspected in the municipal warehouses and only thereafter be taken to their own shops and warehouses This time the magistracy seemed more liberal than before This was due to influence from Warsaw and also of the occupying power But this time too the magistracy sought to retain in its jurisdiction whatever they could They retained almost entirely petty trading in articles of daily use excluding thereby a whole series of products from Jewish trade Some gilds like those of the tailors and capmakers did not want to relinquish their historic privileges even though the Jewish tailors and capmakers were twice or thrice as numerous as the gentile artisans The various proposals were returned to the Assessors Court for final decision At the same time the court also took up the controversy between the Kazimierz magistracy and the Jews concerning previous Jewish misdeeds such as ruining the city brick buildings trading with beer of foreign breweries etc The Kazimierz matter was turned over by the Assessors Court on November 7 177 to the Cracow wojewoda But since Rzewuski was still a prisoner in Moscow nothing was done about it until August 1 1772 when Kazimierz was in the hands of the Austrians Since this time too the Jews were not able to produce the necessary documents and since the Polish rule was temporarily in abeyance the Assessors Court postponed action until the return of the native government In the meantime however the occupying power began to consider the matter in its own way and in the light of its own interests APPENDIX THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF GUTMAN RAKOWSKI MADE WHILE PRISONER OF THE CONFEDERATES IN LANCKORONA AMK fasc Zydzi V Copy of the last will and testament of Gutman Rakowski head

which I was parnes They perpetrated the worst deeds upon me They tore up valuable papers important bills and notes of various nobles and churches and some from the leaders of the Confederates too These had been given to me for various goods They were taken by force from my shop and they amounted to 2 zlotys or more I also had five notes from the deceased Prince Jordan the elder of Siedmiochow

AT THE TIME OF THE\n<BR> CONFEDERACY OF BAR (1768-72)\n</H3>\n<P>\nBy MAJER BALABAN\n<BR>Originally published in Yivo Hijtorijbe Shrifin, ii (1937)\n<P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the saddest chapters in the history of Cracow\nis the period of the Confederacy of Bar (1768-72).\nFor decades afterwards old people used to recall those terrible days\nwhen the city frequently changed hands and the soldiers, both Russian\nand Bar, plundered shops, set fire to the suburbs and even to the\nhouses in the city, took as prisoners either real or supposed followers\nof the \"enemy\" and, through oppressive extortions and forced deliveries,\nsqueezed the last pennies out of merchants, artisans\nand even clergy.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">For Jews this period was even more terrible than for\nthe other citizens.  Both the Russians and the Confederates considered\nthe Jews as enemies from the start.  Without mercy they hung Jews on\nbranches of trees.  Both sides demanded heavy deliveries of bread and\nmeat, quartering of soldiers and also armed help and espionage service.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Even before this confederacy, i.e. during the time\nof the Radom Confederacy and before the time that the Warsaw Sejm,\nupon the order of Repnin, had decided to give equal rights to the\ndissenters, the followers of the old order attempted to prevent this\nthrough various means.  Priests denounced equal rights from their\npulpits as the act of the devil and attempted through defamatory\npamphlets to undermine Repnin's aims.  One such satire is the\n\"Manifesto of the Confederated Israelite Nobility,\nof the Foreign Nations, of the Former Inhabitants of Jerusalem.\"\nIt was distributed by special messengers among various cities and was\nalso copied from hand to hand.  In this manifesto, the Jews supposedly\ncomplain that while the rights of nobility and equal rights are being\ngiven to Lutherans and Orthodox, they, the ancient Jerusalem nobility,\nolder than any other, are omitted.  In order to provide a semblance of\nveracity to this complaint, the author depicts the Jews as complaining\nof their unhappy condition and the way in which they are despised by\nvarious circles among the people.  \"No one has respect for us,\" they\nsay.  \"On the contrary, only too frequently does each one of us have\na stone from a Christian lad fly by our head.\" The pamphlet is set in\nthe chancery style of the Polish documents of the Jewish councils, even\nthough the Councils of the Lands had ceased to exist since 1764. . . .</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This pamphlet was only a political anecdote.  Following\nit came the tragic reality--the Confederacy of Bar.  Immediately after\nit was started in Bar the news reached Cracow.  Specially manufactured\nnewspapers, dated Warsaw, were distributed throughout the city.  Residents\nread with gusto \"of the victories of the Confederates over the Russians,\nof the triumphs of Pulawski over Padgorichanin, Kretchnikov and\nApraksin\" and readily believed them.\nThey inwardly suppressed their enmity to their age-old enemies and their\nallies on the Polish throne.  In time the nobility of the Cracow region\nwas divided into supporters and opponents of the Confederation and they\nbattled with each other in the Proszow Sejmik.  The townspeople and the\nJews stood in between and awaited whatever time and the future would\nbring.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Soon the report came to the Cracow Town Hall that\nthe Confederates were routed and that Bar and Berdichev were captured.\nTo the Jewish town hall in Kazimierz came the report of the slaughter\nat Urnan, in which almost all the Jews of the town were killed. There\nwas not too much time to meditate on these happenings.  On June 20,\n1768 the wojewodztwo of the Confederation of Cracow was organized and\nit selected as marshall the well-known play-boy and profilgate, Michal\nCzarnocki, the owner of Secymin.  The very next day the Confederates\ntook over the Cracow garrison.  The town administration thereupon swore\nallegiance, without hesitation, to Czarnocki.  Only the town-mayor,\nPiotr Szaster, laid down his post.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">These formalities were hardly completed when Russian\ntroops appeared outside the city and shooting began at the Slawkowska\ngate.  In order to protect the city from sudden attack Czarnocki ordered\nthe city gates to be closed during the day and he introduced special\npasses for those who had business outside the city gates.  This immediately\naffected the Jews, who lived in Kazimierz but had their stores and\nwarehouses in Cracow.  Only a few succeeded in securing passes.  The\ngreat majority could not get into Cracow and the Jewish shops, therefore,\nremained closed for a long period.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Meanwhile the Russians, under Apraksin and Prozorovski,\nencircled the city with an increasingly tight cordon.  They cut off\nthe supply of food and captured the small groups of Confederates who\nhad rushed to the aid of their comrades.  Nevertheless the siege lasted\nfor eight weeks.  The orders of Repnin, intended to hasten the end\nof the war, were of no avail.  He advised the use of spies and Jews.\nIn order to force the Jews into submission he suggested that they be\nthreatened with exile deep into Russia or hanging upon the first suitable\nbranch.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Soon hunger began to be felt in Cracow. The burghers\ndemanded that the city surrender.  The Confederates, losing more and\nmore every day, attributed all their defeats to treason and searched\nfor spies everywhere.  Several \"spies\" were hung in the market place,\namong them also Jews.  Among those hung was Ciszek, the officer of\nthe town garrison, who was accused of being in contact with the Russians.\nThe go-between was alleged to be Isaac of Kazimierz, a Jew from Sacz,\n\"who used to meet with a Cossack officer in the Kazimierz synagogue.\"\nThis allegation was reported by a memoir writer of the time and has\nbeen repeated uncritically by all subsequent historians who did not\nstop to reflect that in July 1768, Kazimierz was still in the hands\nof the Confederates.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">When Czarnocki saw that he would not be able to hold\nCracow, he ordered the Jews to supply 600 men.  Weeping, they told\nhim that there were altogether only 1,500 souls in the empty Jewish\ncity and he ordered them to pay 80,000 zlotys within a week.  The Jews\nbegan to bargain with him and he became impatient.  He ordered the\nparnes of the community (Fayvush Giesser) to be seized, and his head,\nbeard and ear-locks to be shaved.  He threatened to do the same to\nothers if one penny were missing from the sum he set.  The Jews temporarily\npaid several thousand zlotys; they were relieved of paying the rest\nby the Russians, who captured Kazimierz and the Jewish quarter on August\n1, 1768.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Russians used Kazimierz as operations base to\nstorm Cracow during the following two weeks.  During this period they\nused Jews to build trenches and bury their dead.  They also quartered\ntheir soldiers in Jewish homes.  On August 17, the Russians entered\nCracow.  After they had driven the Confederates deep into Russia, they\nmade themselves comfortable in the city.  They imposed heavy tribute\nupon the population and threatened hanging for the slightest provocation.\nDrevich carried on more wildly than any other.  He would continue to\ndispatch contingents of troops to capture the fortresses in the neighborhood,\nTyniec, Lanckorona and Czestochowa. The permanent Cracow commandant,\nLobry, was more humane.  The townspeople became intimate with him and\nJews also had access to him.  They served as purveyors for him and\nsought his help in their struggle with their own co-religionists for\ncontrol of the community.  The rich Cracow Jew, Israel Aronovich, purveyor\nof the mint, became a factor for Lobry.  He \"loaned\" huge sums to Lobry\nas well as to the later commandants, and these \"loans\" were at the\nexpense of the Cracow Jewish community.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Russians remained in Cracow a whole year.  On\nSeptember 3, they liquidated their command and left the city in order\nto storm Czgstochowa, the strongest fortress of the Confederates.\nBefore they retired they ordered the Jews to pay 7,000 zlotys for the\nsupplies they were leaving behind in the Wawel warehouse.  These supplies\nhad been delivered by Jewish purveyors who had not been paid for them.\nNow the Jewish community had to pay the required sum and the supplies\nthereupon were taken over by the Confederates who occupied Cracow on\nSeptember 13.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">A new series of requisitions and forced deliveries\nof goods, grain and wood now began.  Marshal Dzierzanowski had captured\nthe Wieliczka mines without a shot and he imposed upon the merchants,\ncraft guilds, clergy and Jews the obligation to buy 1,000 barrels of\nsalt at a very high price.  On the very first day he extracted 18,000\nzlotys from various individuals.  Others paid for the salt later.\nIn return, however, they only received paper money, which lost its\nvalue when the Confederates again abandoned Cracow.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">On November 9, 1769, the Confederates abandoned the\ncity.  The Russians returned and remained there until June, 1772, when\nthe first partition of Poland took place.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">For two full years the impoverished and sacked city\nhad to support the Muscovite troops, who continued to carry out attacks\nin various directions.  At the same time the inhabitants also suffered\nfrom diversionary attacks made from time to time by the Confederates.\nThus on November 26, 1769, the hussars of Trzebinski and Paszkowski\nattacked the Jewish quarter.  The Russian soldiers were then in the\nJewish bathhouse.  Many were hacked to death and others taken away\nas prisoners.  The Jews, because they had \"taken care of\" the Russians,\npaid for it with the plundering of their shops and warehouses. Such\nattacks were repeated many times during the course of the winter of\n1769-70, as on January 17, 1770, March 1, and March 4. On each occasion\nthe Confederates plundered the Jews or took them as prisoners.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">&#9;The summer of 1770 was relatively calm.  But\nthe diversions and attacks were renewed in the winter of 1770-71.\nOn January 13, the Confederates attacked Kazimierz, managed to reach\nthe house of the commandant, Major Orszakow, killed some of his men\nand took others prisoner.  Then they attacked Cracow.  They were not\nsuccessful and therefore also abandoned Kazimierz.  They thereupon\nplundered the Jewish homes and dealt with the Jews in \"so godless a\nmanner\" that it seemed incredible to the correspondent of the <I>Hildesheimer</I>\n<I>Relationskurrier. </I>The same correspondent estimated the Jewish\ndamage of that day at 300,000 zlotys.  Even though this sum is obviously\nexaggerated it does testify to the great damage suffered by the Jews.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">A few days later Paszkowski's and Schutz's divisions\nrepeated the attack on Kazimierz.  They caught many Jews and dragged\nthem off.  Many of them were hung on the way.  Twelve others, among\nthem the <I>parnes, </I>Gutman Rakowski, were incarcerated in Lanckorona\nand Wieliczka and 12,000 zlotys were demanded as ransom money.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Rakowski could not endure the beating he was\nsubjected to upon his arrest on the way.  When he felt he was dying\nhe called Israel Davidovich and Levi Jakhimovich and dictated his will\nin their presence.  From this we learn of the sufferings he endured\nin prison, how his home in the Jewish quarter was destroyed, papers\nworth more than 2,000 zlotys torn up, and how, \"by whips\" they extracted\nfrom him the bit of cash he had taken with him on the road.  Rakowski\ndied in Lanckorona on June 18, 1771.  When his wife learned of the\ndeath of her husband she gathered together her last pennies and, at\ngreat risk, came to Lanckorona in order to redeem his body. The Confederates,\nhowever, refused to lower the price they had previously set.  They\nreleased only several of the Jews and kept the others in prison.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">It is also very interesting that during this time\nthere was a Jew who, instead of helping his brothers, sought to make\na fortune out of the Jewish tragedy.  This was Nakhman of Kalwarja,\nthe factor of Korytowski and purveyor to Prince Czartoryski.  The families\nof the captured Jews addressed a request to him that he intervene with\nthe Confederates in their behalf.  Through him, too, they sent food\nand money for their unfortunate relatives.  Nakhman mercilessly took\nthe money for himself and in addition he persuaded Korytowski to increase\nthe rental fee for his \"grey house\" in Cracow, notwithstanding the\nexplicit prohibition by the Prince.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The last heroic act of the Confederates was the\ncapture of the Wawel Castle.  Here they remained several months.\nDuring this period one of their divisions again plundered the Jewish\nquarter and dragged off a number of Jews as prisoners.  These were\nkept for several months in the Wieliczka prison in hunger and cold.\nA Jew, Aron Wielitchker, who allied himself with the Confederates,\nhelped make their lot worse.  On May 5, 1772, at-the end of the Confederate\nperiod, the Cracow Jewish community excommunicated Nakhman.  But the\nunfortunate prisoners continued to be held.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">At this time the partition treaty of the three great\npowers had already been signed.  The foreign troops pecked, at the\nliving body of the Polish state like birds of prey.  Because of\nthe vague formulation of the treaty, the Austrians took over Kazimierz\nand with it the Jewish quarter, while the Poles retained Cracow.  The\nJews of Cracow suddenly became subjects of Her Royal Majesty, Maria\nTheresa.  They submitted to their new rulers a list of the damages\nthey had suffered at the hands of the Russians and the Confederates.\nJewish individuals suffered damages to the amount of 288,131 zlotys.\nThe community, according to the oath of the <I>parnosim, </I>also had\nincurred expenses . . . . These they estimated at 130,000 zlotys.\nTogether the sum amounted to 418,131 zlotys.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This was the flag under which the history of Cracow\nJews proceeded in those days of plagues, when every month, if not every\nday, brought with it new restrictive orders and troubles, and when\nthe Jewish quarter was a battlefield commanded now by the Russians,\nnow by the Confederates.  Not one house in the city emerged intact.\nMost of the stores were plundered and the community itself, including\nits <I>parnosim, </I>was oppressed and disgraced.  These <I>parnosim\n</I>and their syndics lived as on a volcano.  Every minute they were\ncalled or dragged to another officer.  To each one they had to bow\ntheir heads, appease him and stuff him with gold unless they wanted\nto be hung on the first good branch of a tree or be hacked to death\nin the gateway of their own house.  It is, therefore, no wonder that\nthe <I>parnosim </I>took money from whatever source they could.  They\nwould extort some from members of the community; some they would borrow\nat exorbitant rates of interest, often up to 40 percent.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">During the early period of the Confederacy of Bar,\nthe following <I>parnosim </I>stood at the head of the community without\ninterruption and without elections: Fayvush Giesser, Gutman Rakowski,\nDr. Mendl Kalahora, all allied with the well-known Jekeles family.\nThis family was represented in the council of the community by the\nold Moyshe Jekeles, who was looked upon as the head of the community.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jekeles family and their allies ruled over the\nCracow community for over 150 years.  Jewish families declined and\nnew ones rose to power, Jews became rich and Jews became poor, but\nthe Jekeles family continued to hold communal power.  They had to endure\nmore than one battle to maintain their control which they looked upon\nas a hereditary power.  The fortune of the family came to be divided\nup.  There were rich members of the family and poor ones.  Our Moyshe\nwas of the poor ones.  Notwithstanding his modest fortune and his old\nage, which made him bent and hunch-backed, he possessed a firm spirit\nand the pride of an aristocrat and he stood up courageously against\nthe machinations of his opponents.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Gutman Rakowski occupied the leading place in the\nJekeles faction.  Rakowski's grandfather had occupied a communal post.\nIn 1745 his father, Berl Rakowski, was among the <I>tuvim </I>and he\nhimself became that year one of the community councilors (<I>mezy</I>\nor <I>dziewiecmezy). </I>During the years 1756-61, in the struggle\nbetween the Jewish and non-Jewish merchants, Berl was also one of the\n<I>tuvim </I>and all his goods were confiscated at that time. This\naffected him so deeply that he became ill and soon died.  His son Gutman\ntook over his business as well as his debts.  It was this Gutman\nwho died in Lanckorona as a prisoner of the Confederates.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Dr. Mendl Kalahora came from a well-known Sephardic\nfamily. His father, Dr. Aron Kalahora, was the first Jew to receive\na diploma from the Cracow Academy.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush Giesser was a new figure in Cracow.  He came\nfrom Zolkiew.  He married in Cracow and thanks to his family connections\nsoon became <I>parnes.  </I>In 1767 we find him in this post together\nwith Hershl Stobnitzki, one of the most powerful of the Cracow Jews.\nThese two had attempted to smooth over the trouble between the arrendator\nof liquor taxes, Leizer Melekhiovich, and the trustee of <I>the hekdesh,\ni.e. </I>the head of the charity committee, Jonah Rabinovich.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The incident was trivial but it created a great stir.\nMelekhovich was arrendator of liquor taxes and he prevented the Jews\nfrom selling liquor in their taverns.  That is why he was hated in\nthe towns.  Because he feared revenge, Leizer induced the provincial\ngovernment to take him out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish community\ncourt and to provide him with a letter of protection.  The community\nwanted to play a prank on him in return and it permitted one of its\nmembers, Jonah Rabinovich, to rent Leizer's pew in the old synagogue.\nLeizer became infuriated at the community and went to the officer of\nthe Kazimierz garrison, Antoni Eismond, who brought back to Jonah the\nmoney he paid for Leizer's pew.  Jonah, in turn, turned the money over\nto the trustees of the <I>hekdesh </I>(the pew belonged to them) and\nthen Eismond, with military escort, came to the meeting of the trustees,\nread them the letter of the wojewoda and demanded to know if they were\nready to obey the commands of the wojewoda and respect the protective\ndocuments he issued.  The trustees were not overawed by the officer's\nthreats and immediately turned the case over to the Jewish court.\nThe latter excommunicated Leizer and ordered him jailed.  The sextons\ntook Leizer to the jail next to the synagogue while Eismond's soldiers\ntook Jonah Rabinovich into custody and put him into the wojewoda\njail, <I>i.e. </I>in the local prison.  Fayvush Giesser, <I>parnes\n</I>of the community, saw the danger in the situation and intervened.\nHe invited Eismond to the home of the rabbi, where Hershl Stobnitzki\nand Dr. Kalahara were already waiting.  Unexpectedly Jonah arrived\ntoo.  He had gotten out of jail.  He punched Eismond in the nose several\ntimes.  The latter fainted and was revived by the rabbi's wife.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The whole affair was so strange that it came to the\nwojewoda court.  After listening to testimony, the court decreed that\nJonah Rabinovich was to be imprisoned for six months and was not to\noccupy any public post for six years.  Hershl Stobnitzki was sentenced\nto two weeks in prison and was barred from public office for three\nyears.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Jonah was so broken up by this sentence that he never\nagain served as a <I>parnes.  </I>Stobnitzki emerged again a few years\nlater.  Both, however, could not be selected at the next communal election\nand they were replaced by (in addition to Kalahora and Giesser) Rakowski,\nIsrael Aronovich and, as usual, by one of the Jekeles family-- Moyshe\nJekeles.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Even before the arrival of the Confederates these\n<I>parnosim </I>had had great difficulties in collecting taxes and\nin covering the communal debts that had reached astronomical proportions.\nWhen the Confederates arrived, pillaging and hanging again set in.\nSoon the Russians came and Capt. Lobry assumed command of the Cracow\ngarrison.  Aronovich, also known as Menashe's, became an intimate of\nhis.  He was made a purveyor for the Russian army and came to have\na powerful influence in the Jewish community and even in the city of\nCracow.  Israel, it is true, used his influence for the benefit of\nthe Jewish population but he did not mind spending communal money in\norder to satisfy the military.  He made loans at high interest rates\nand imposed increasingly high consumers taxes which poisoned the life\nof the already impoverished Cracow Jewry.  By these methods Israel\nmanaged to win over Lobry to his side and also his successors, Oebelschwitz\nand Stahremberg, and, together with his four friends, automatically\noccupied the posts of <I>parnosim </I>for four continuous years, without\nrendering account to anyone over this long period.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Against \"Jekeles' five\" and his plunder-economy,\nprotests came from the Stobnitzkis (officially the father, Moyshe,\nand behind the scenes, his son Hersh), Shimen Bass, Moyshe Braciejowski\nand later the purveyor of the Warsaw mint, Fayvush Abrahamovich, who,\nthanks to his position, was relieved of payments and had the right\nto buy up silver coins throughout the country.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush Abrahamovich came from Przedborz and was\napparently a relative or in-law of the famous Landau family.  Around\n1750 he came to Cracow and there married the daughter of a rich\nJew, Avigdor ben Moyshe Gumprecht.   Avigdor had been a <I>parnes\n</I>for several years but he had a bad reputation.  His father had\nalso been a <I>parnes </I>in the second decade of the 18th century,\nbut he was unable to give proper accounting of -the public funds and\nhe landed in the wojewoda prison in 1728.  In order to secure his release,\nhe extorted from the community secretary, Joshua Horowitz, a\nwritten declaration that he had returned to him all accounts and receipts\nas well as the 400 zlotys cash which he had been accused of appropriating.\nHorowitz gave Moyshe such a declaration but on March 21, 1728, he withdrew\nit in the presence of the syndic and vice-syndic and had his withdrawal\nrecorded in the wojewoda books.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Avigdor was no better than his father.  But a more\ninteresting type was his son-in-law, Fayvush Abrahamovich.  He won\nthe sympathy of the opposition elements in the community.  The enemies\nof the Jekeles faction authorized him to induce the Russian authorities\nto set the drawing of lots for the intermediate days of Passover.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Faysush began with a clever trick.  He took advantage\nof the fact\nthat Moyshe Jekeles was old, that Israel Aronovich was away on business\nto Warsaw and that others were absent from the city or were imprisoned\nby the Confederates so that only Dr. Mendl Kalahora could come to the\ncommunity house, and called together a meeting of some fifty Jews of\nthe town on February 2, 1772.  They passed the following resolution:</P>\n<DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In view of the fact of the oppression and the sad\nstate of the community of Kazimierz near Cracow ... because of the\ntimes of plagues, because of all kinds of armies everywhere . . . and\njust because of this we endure suffering every minute and every hour\nthat cannot be recorded on paper, and especially because our city has\nbecome empty, and we can no longer bear the burdens, and there is no\nhelp or support to come from anywhere--we therefore have, with God's\nhelp, decided not to allow that the Jews be scattered from the city\nand we have decided to select several people to complete the number\nof <I>roshim </I>[heads] missing on the <I>kahal board:</I> inspectors\nof accounts <I>(roei heshbonot), hekdesh </I>trustees, and nine <I>kahal\n</I>men. These newly selected men must be ready at any moment to help\nthe <I>tuvim </I>[optimates], control the schedule of duties and take\nmeasures to collect them.</P></DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">It seems likely that the opposition was more interested\nin control than in aid.  But the incumbent <I>parnosim </I>did not\nwant to agree to this and luck was with them; the very same day the\nConfederates captured the Wawel Castle, shooting began and there was\nno opportunity for discussion.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayrush Abrahamovich did not give up.  Thirsting\nfor revenge against the Jekeles faction, he paid no attention to personal\ndangers nor to material damages and he determined to crush all obstacles\nin order to carry through new elections and secure the <I>kahal</I>\nmandates for himself and for his supporters.  Since Rzewuski, the Cracow\nwojewoda, was a prisoner of the Russians, it was necessary to appeal\nto the highest authorities in Warsaw to get permission to carry through\nthe elections.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush, therefore, went to Warsaw.  He succeeded\nin winning over the chancellor, Father Mlodziejowski, and the latter\ninvited the Russian General Waynmarn and several staff-officers to\ndinner several times in order to get them to permit the elections for\nthe Cracow <I>kahal. </I>Waynmarn issued the appropriate order to the\nCracow commandant Oebelschwitz, and the latter immediately gave his\nconsent to issue such a permit.  He only expressed his \"unofficial\nopinion that the new <I>kahal </I>council would be adapted to the demands\nof the Russian army both in respect to loyalty and in respect to supplies,\ntransport, spies and the like\"</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In order to assure the commandant of his loyalty,\nFayvush gave him, as he later testified, 500 zlotys.  Before he received\nthe rescript for the elections, however, Oebelschwitz left his post\nand was succeeded by Capt.  Stahremberg. Stahremberg also adhered to\nthe view of his predecessor regarding \"the benefits which the Russian\ncommand had derived from the old <I>kahal\" </I>and had planned to make\nsuch a report to his superiors.  But Fayvush anticipated this and sent\nhim a present (certainly not out of his own pocket.) of 200 ducats.\nIn his notes on this, Fayvush added the interesting comment that \"Stahremberg\nhad yielded only after much pleading and importuning . . . But [when\nhe took the 200 ducats] he had done him a great favor, because he could\nhave, had he wanted, taken three times as much from the old <I>parnosim.\"</P>\n</I><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Armed with Stahremberg's permit, Fayvush now\nplayed the role of a formalist and decided to carry out the drawing\nof lots, in accordance with law, with the assistance of the Jewish\njudge.  The Jewish judge, Kurdwanowski, a well-known adherent of the\nConfederates, lived in hiding outside Cracow.  Fayvush turned to Sebastjan\nBadeni, the judge of the Cracow castle and inspector of the mint, to\nget him into the Jewish quarter in Kazimierz and to intervene with\nthe commandant of the city.  Badeni undertook the mission for the price\nof 100 ducats. He invited Stahremberg to lunch and secured from him\na safe-conduct for a short term. Protected by such a safe-conduct,\nthe Jewish judge arrived in Kazimierz.  He collected 100 ducats, however,\nfor his expenses and labors.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">New elections were now held for the <I>kahal.  </I>The\nold council was deposed and Fayvush Abrahamovich, Hershl Stobnitzki\nand their supporters were elected as the new <I>parnosim. </I>As soon\nas it was constituted, the new <I>kahal </I>carried out an examination\nof the accounts of the preceding four years.  At the same time it issued\nan announcement calling upon all who had any information to declare\non oath in what ways they had been wronged by Israel Aronovich and\nhis friends.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In order to annoy him further, Fayvush had Israel\nput into the pillory in the old synagogue and then he issued a very\nsevere sentence upon him which was pronounced in the same synagogue\nwith black candles and with the call of the shofar.  While listening\nto the verdict, Israel stood bound in heavy chains and his pew in the\nsynagogue was draped in black as for one who had died.  After the ceremony\nIsrael was paraded through the city to the jail.  When his mother,\nan old lady of 70, tried to approach him, Fayvush pushed her away with\nsuch force that she fell to the earth and fainted.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Israel remained in prison for several weeks.  Only\nwhen his wife brought Fayvush cash and securities valued at 300 ducats\nwas he released and he had to swear that he would not seek satisfaction\nin the state courts.  At the same time he signed a declaration that\nhe had given Fayrush the 300 ducats of his own good will and without\npressure.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">No sooner had Israel left the walls of the jail than\nhe proceeded immediately to Cracow, dispatched a thundering protest\nto the regional court and hired horses to go to Warsaw to seek the\naid of his protectors.  Fayvush heard of all this immediately and he\nordered Israel's wife to summon her husband to the Jewish quarter.\nWhen she refused he ordered Israel to be excommunicated the following\nSabbath and had the ban proclaimed in six synagogues.  To wreak his\nvengeance still further he had Israel's wife roused out of bed and,\nwith an escort of 15 night-watchmen carrying lanterns, taken to the\nold synagogue to hear the excommunication proclaimed against her husband.\nFayvush also vented his rage on Israel's daughter; he took away from\nher fiance the securities which her father had deposited for her dowry.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Israel knew of all that was going on.  His good friends\ninformed him how Fayvush was maltreating his wife and daughter and\ninsulting him and his near ones.  He therefore spared no money or energy\nto gain access to the occupying powers.  With the aid of friends among\nthe nobility he secured an order to Stahremberg from the Russian General\nBibikov that the investigation of the quarrel between the former and\npresent <I>parnosim </I>of the <I>kahal </I>be reopened.  Bibikov also\nordered that two ranking Russian officers participate in the investigation.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush Abrahamovich was afraid of the reopening\nof the investigation, especially since he did not know how the Russian\nofficers would behave.  Through the intervention of Badeni, he secured\npermission to have two Polish officers at the hearing of testimony.\nThe commission thus included Major Artzybashev and a captain (name\nunknown) from the Russian side; the Jewish judge, Kurdwanowski, and\nthe sub-delegate from Cracow, Krowicki, for the Polish side.  Fayvush\nbribed them all.  He even sent gifts to the investigators and the secretaries.\nHe derived little benefit from it, however.  Major Artzybashev sent\nthe record of the proceedings to Stahremberg and the latter sent it\nimmediately to General von Roenne at Lublin.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">No one in Cracow knew who was in charge of civil\naffairs in the Russian command in Lublin.  Fayvush, therefore, sent\na special messenger to secure this information.  It turned out that\nthe civil commissioner was Major Hoshan, Lobry's former aide, and a\ngood friend of Fayvush.  Fayvush despatched 200 ducats to win him over\nto his side.  Without even reading the records, Hoshan returned them\nto Cracow with an order to Stahremberg that he deal with the matter\nhimself.  Stahrenberg turned the dossier over to the reporter, Piotr\nSzaster, the former mayor of Cracow and now an official in the commandatura.\nSzaster examined the whole case, recognized Fayvush's guilt and ordered\nhim to pay 200 ducats to Israel and 100 to the Jewish community.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush was not successful this time in making an\nappeal.  He was immediately taken into custody and forced to pay the\nabove-mentioned sums. He was detained even after payment until further\nword came from higher channels, first from Moscow, then from Prussia,\nand finally from Austria.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Just at this time the Russians left Cracow and Kazimierz\nand turned the cities over to the Prussians.  The latter also left\nsoon and on June 11, 1772, both cities were occupied by Austrian troops.\nLater the Austrians left Cracow but retained Kazimierz, which is on\nthe right bank of the Vistula.  General D'Alton set up his command\nheadquarters first in Wieliczka, later in Tarnow.  Only the district\noffice was left in Wieliczka and the commanding officer there was Joseph\nvon Baum.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The members of the former <I>kahal </I>quickly oriented\nthemselves to the situation.  Taking advantage of the fact that Fayvush\nwas still in jail, they sent Israel to Wieliczka to sound out the new\nrulers.  Israel was able to reach D'Alton and he gave him his version\nof the whole matter.  D'Alton, not having the slightest notion of what\nhad been going on in the city for years, immediately dispatched his\nlieutenant-auditor, Mansack, to Cracow and gave him Dobrowolski as\naide.  The latter soon became the Jewish judge for the Austrians.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Mansack treated Fayvush as a criminal.  He was kept\nin jail, and sent to court and to the investigating magistrate under\nguard.  The gifts which Fayvusli sent to both officials were of no\navail.  Mansack assembled all the Jews in the synagogue, ordered the\nold <I>kahal de</I>posed and a new one elected.  The new one consisted\nfor the most part of the Jekeles faction.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Finally, Fayvush got out of jail.  He immediately\ncharged Mansack with taking bribes and bringing harm to the Austrian\nauthority.  D'Alton had Mansack arrested but he took no action\non the matter itself but transferred it to Lemberg.  To Lemberg, therefore,\nwent Avigdor, the father-in-law of Fayvush and he succeeded in having\nthe matter directed \"temporarily\" to Wieliczka for further investigation.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In the meantime Shloyme Rabinovich, son-in-law of\nMoyshe Jekeles, delivered to Emperor Joseph <I>ein alluntertanigstes\nImmediatgesuch, </I>in which he described in detail the \"robberies\nand bribes\" of the incumbent <I>kahal </I>elders.  Joseph II turned\nover the request to the Lemberg authorities and the governor appointed\na commission to investigate the charges.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This was the beginning of Austrian rule in Kazimierz.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">During this terrible period, a time of civil war\nand of conflicts between Jewish factions, the fight also continued\nbetween the Jews and the Kazimierz magistrates concerning the right\nto trade in the Jewish town and also with the Cracow magistrates concerning\ntrade and work in Cracow.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The constitution of 1768 had declared that in those\ncities where there were no agreements with the Jews, commercial agreements\nbe made with them.  It did not indicate, however, who was to take the\ninitiative, what sort of agreements they were to be and what was to\nbe done if the authorities did not want to make such an agreement.\nThe matter was given some attention in Cracow and in Kazimierz but\nno progress was made because just at that time, in 1768, Cracow was\noccupied first by the Confederates and then by the Russians.  When\nthe Russian occupation continued on, however, and the Jews in Cracow\nonce again opened their shops and warehouses and some of them did quite\nwell with military supplies, the municipal authorities remembered their\nold headache and once again entered charges against the Jews in the\nAssessor's Court in Warsaw.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">On June 30, 1769, the trial opened.  The municipal\nauthorities were represented by Jan Nepomucen Slominski, the Jewish\ncommunity by Antoni Opelewski.  The court postponed the case because\nboth sides had failed to present their documents in time.  The case\nwas resumed over a year later, on November 7, 1770.  This time the\nmunicipality was represented by Pawel Bialobrzeski and the Jews again\nby Opelewski.  Opelewski proposed the agreement of 1609, which Wladyslaw\nIV had confirmed in 1630 and which stipulated that in case of conflict\nthe Jews were to come not under the jurisdiction of the Assessors Court\nbut under that of the wojewoda.  Bialobrzeski appealed to the constitution\nof 1764 and claimed that the Assessors Court was competent to try the\ncase.  The court agreed with the conclusions of the lawyer for the\nJews and sent the case to the Cracow wojewoda with the comment that\nhe should see to it that the litigants arrange a commercial agreement\nbetween them, with the right of appeal to the Assessor's Court.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Unfortunately for the Jews, the Cracow wojewoda,\nRzewuski, was a prisoner of the Russians and the Jewish judge Kurdwanowski,\na supporter of the Confederates, was in hiding in the suburbs of the\ncity. There was no authority, therefore, that could take the case in\nhand and the officials took advantage of this and began, on their own,\nto shut down Jewish shops and to confiscate the goods.  The Jews thereupon\nhastened to Commandant Oebelschwitz and he, in turn, sent a letter\nto his superior, General Waynmarn in Warsaw, inquiring what he should\ndo in the matter.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Waynmarn forbade the Cracow commandant to interfere\nin a matter which was not his concern. Meanwhile the municipal officials\nwere able to secure from King Stanislaw August (December 8, 1770) a\nconfirmation of the decree of 1750 of August III, which forbade the\nJews from carrying on trade in Cracow.  The city officials immediately\ncalled the Jewish elders to the Town Hall, read the decree to them\nand ordered them immediately to close up their shops and cease their\ntrade. On December 17, 1770, the Jews entered a protest and on December\n29, they submitted a memorandum that the city officials had again begun\nto confiscate Jewish property as in the years 1742-1761. The city officials\npaid scant attention to the protests and on January 3, 1771, they publicly\nproclaimed the royal decree and continued to confiscate Jewish goods,\nalthough a bit more cautiously.  They were cautious because they did\nnot know how the occupying power would view the matter and Waynmarn's\ninstructions to Oebelschwitz were not known in the city. There was\na series of protests and counter protests until the matter came back\nto the Assessor's Court.  The Christian party sought to hasten the\ntrial, the Jews to delay it.  The Russian army in Kazimierz was forcing\nthe Jews to repair the city and at the same time the Jews could not\ngain access to their archives and get the needed documents.  The Jewish\n<I>parnosim </I>could not leave the city to go to intervene in Warsaw.\nThey had to stand guard over their person and property.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jewish community appealed on February 26, 1771\nto the chancellor, Father Mlodziejowski, and he intervened by asking\nthe Cracow magistrate to conclude \"any sort of peace\" with the Jews.\nThe Jews also addressed themselves to the town-president \"that, out\nof respect for the letter of protection of the chancellor he should\nbe inclined toward peace.\" The president was persuaded and he called\nupon the Jews to present their trade proposals.  He set the condition,\nhowever, that the basis for the negotiations should be the sacramental\nagreement of 1485.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Finally, on July 31 and August 1, 1771, the <I>kahal\nparnosim</I> submitted an extensive memorial.  In it they described\ntheir critical financial situation, the debts of the <I>kahal </I>and\nof individual merchants and also the various imperial and <I>kahal\n</I>taxes, all of which weighed most heavily upon them.  From this\nmemorial it appears that the Jews owed the shlakhta and the Polish\ntownsmen about 850,000 zlotys.  The debt to the foreign merchants amounted\nto over 10,000 thaler.  In order to meet the <I>kahal </I>obligations,\nthey indicated that they needed 130,800 zlotys annually, which they\nderived from the members of the community by direct taxes and consumer\ntaxes.  In order to carry this burden they had to have a source of\nincome and only trade could serve as such.  The Jews of Cracow had\nengaged in trade since the most ancient times, notwithstanding the\ninterference of the gentile merchants.  They asked, therefore, not\nfor new rights or liberties but only that sanction be given to the\nactual condition.  At the same time they wished to restrict their trade\nonly to the most necessary goods and they yielded the trade in luxury\ngoods to the Christian merchants.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jews demanded the right to trade in the following\nwares: (1) white goods: linen, canvass etc.; (2) woolen goods: cloth,\nDutch flannel, baize, mourning cloth, camlet; (3) silks; taffeta, damask;\n(4) notions: pins, needles, buttons, scissors, tobacco cases etc.;\n(5 ) furs: fur skins, rabbit, squirrel, etc.; (6) Turkish goods; rugs,\ndivans, night-caps, gloves, etc.; (7) spices: sugar, coffee, pepper,\nginger, etc.; (8) ornaments, lace; (9) skins, chamois, morocco, etc.;\n(10) handwork, used and new cloths; (11) brandy; (12) crafts: tailoring,\ncapmaking, furrier, lace-making, embroidery, gold and silver works.\nThe Jews offered to give up trade in (1) expensive cloth; (2) French\ncloth; (3) jewelry, diamonds, watches, credenzas, knives, candle-sticks,\nclostly mirrors; (4) Bavarian and English notions, better shoes, silver\nprongs, table ware; (5 ) iron: sickles, plough tips;\n(6) Armenian wares; (7) wax, costly wines, drugs, crystal glass,\netc.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jewish proposals elicited a storm in the Cracow\nTown Hall, although it was apparent to all that no changes were\ninvolved in the trade relations in the city.  The deliberations dragged\non and they diligently studied the agreements of 1609 and 1615 and\nanalogous agreements in Lemberg and Posen.  Finally they sent\nan agreement to the lawyer in Warsaw.  It was signed by Feistmantel,\nFlorkowski, Bajer and others.  The agreement set forth that Jews were\npermitted to trade with the following wares in Cracow shops\nand warehouses, being forbidden, however, to distribute them to courts\nof nobles, churches and to the suburbs.  The list included (1) foreign\nlinens of various kinds (white, striped, cotton, tick, coarse linen,\nSilesian, Fustian) to be sold only by the piece and not by the\nyard, since there were many stores that bought by the piece and sold\nat a profit by the yard; (2) muslins, table cloths, napkins, towels,\n(single ones and in sets), linen for painted tapestries (by the piece\nand by the yard), linen kerchiefs by the dozen, cotton fleece tapestries\n(by the piece and by the yard), linen kerchiefs by the dozen, cotton\nfleece nightcaps; (3) cotton goods, chintz, batiste, lace, gauze; (4)\ngingham, baize (by the piece and by the yard); (5 ) ordinary cloth,\nboth smooth or striped and dotted, regular Fustian cloth (by the piece\nbut not by the yard); (6) Scottish woolens, regular wool and halfwool\n(except French and Dutch cloth, which were not to be brought in for\nsale), by the piece and not by the yard, various kinds of crepe, by\npiece, roll or yard; (7) genuine Brabant lace, lace work which the\nJewish women make, by the piece and by the yard; (8) pins, needles,\npipes, long pipes, thimbles, camels' hair; (9) thread, gut, whips;\n(10) rugs, divans, glazed linen, by the piece and by the yard; (11)\nheavy blankets, light blankets, army blankets, regular belts, mattresses,\nquilts (except embroidered), Turkish gowns, saddles, saddle accessories,\nwicks, tallow, Astrakhan short coats and cheaper ones, hats for finishing;\n(12) ladies' and men's second-hand clothing, remnants; (13) goods left\nin pawn; (14) artistic handwork like hand-made buttons.  There were\nalso two final points: (1) the cap makers' gild stood on its rights;\n(2) the wares must be first inspected in the municipal warehouses and\nonly thereafter be taken to their own shops and warehouses.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This time the magistracy seemed more liberal than\nbefore.  This was due to influence from Warsaw and also of the occupying\npower.  But this time too the magistracy sought to retain in its jurisdiction\nwhatever they could.  They retained almost entirely petty trading in\narticles of daily use, excluding thereby a whole series of products\nfrom Jewish trade.  Some gilds, like those of the tailors and capmakers,\ndid not want to relinquish their historic privileges, even though the\nJewish tailors and capmakers were twice or thrice as numerous as the\ngentile artisans.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The various proposals were returned to the Assessors\nCourt for final decision.  At the same time the court also took up\nthe controversy between the Kazimierz magistracy and the Jews concerning\nprevious Jewish misdeeds, such as ruining the city brick buildings,\ntrading with beer of foreign breweries, etc.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Kazimierz matter was turned over by the Assessors\nCourt on November 7, 1770 to the Cracow wojewoda.  But since Rzewuski\nwas still a prisoner in Moscow nothing was done about it until August\n10, 1772, when Kazimierz was in the hands of the Austrians.  Since\nthis time too the Jews were not able to produce the necessary documents\nand since the Polish rule was temporarily in abeyance, the Assessors\nCourt postponed action until the return of the native government. In\nthe meantime, however, the occupying power began to consider the\nmatter in its own way and in the light of its own interests. </P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">APPENDIX</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF GUTMAN RAKOWSKI MADE\nWHILE PRISONER OF THE CONFEDERATES IN LANCKORONA</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">(AMK, fasc.  Zydzi V.)</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Copy of the last will and testament of Gutman\nRakowski, head and <I>parnes </I>of the Jewish community of Kazimierz.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">We, the undersigned, do hereby testify that we hear\nthe words of Gutman Rakowski, of blessed memory, <I>parnes </I>of the\ncommunity of Kazimierz, who was imprisoned in Lanckorona during the\nConfederation by General Schiuz.  Imprisoned with him was\nYisroel Dawidowicz and they were visited by Lewek Jachimowicz, the\narendator of Czernichow and a goldsmith.  Through the latter,\nGutman's wife sent three shirts to the prison.  Gutman, of sound mind,\nmade a will in the presence of Lcwek Jachimowicz and Yisroel Dawidowicz\nand pronounced it in great sorrow.  The contents of the will was as follows:</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Listen my dear good friends!  I am now looking\nforward to death.  I cannot endure any more suffering.  I must seal\nwith my death the severe tortures, the imprisonment and hunger.\nI shall never again see my wife and children alive.  Lying all bruised\nand sick I wept bitterly that I must suffer unjust death for all the\nmembers of the Kazimierz community.  Please tell my wife that nothing\nwill be left to her after my death!  What will she do now and how will\nshe support herself?  I am now a pauper.  Whatever I had in cash or in\ngold, which I tried to hide from the Confederate troops, was taken from me.\nI was attacked suddenly, robbed of everything and everything in my home\nwas destroyed or seized.  I was tortured mercilessly and in my bare\nshirt I was led to prison through the very city in which I was <I>parnes</I>.\nThey perpetrated the worst deeds upon me.  They tore up valuable papers,\nimportant bills and notes of various nobles and churches and some from\nthe leaders of the Confederates too.  These had been given to me for\nvarious goods.  They were taken by force from my shop and they amounted\nto 2,000 zlotys or more.  I also had five notes from the deceased Prince\nJordan, the elder of Siedmiochow, for various goods that he had received\nfrom me.  These amounted to about 2,000 zlotys.  That they tore these\nup has brought me great grief.  What will my wife and children do without\nthese notes?</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">My own brick building I bequeath to no one except to\nmy son Isaac, who loaned me the sum of 2,000 zlotys for repairs.\nThe building belongs to no one but him, as it should be.  Counting\nprofit from that amount for this period would total about 3,000 zlotys\nor more.  This son of mine is the nearest relative and the first to\nreceive the debt owed to him just like the other creditors, for he spent\nmoney for me for various needs and repairs.  In addition to the\nabove-mentioned sum I also owe a still larger sum, of which I positively\nand truthfully here admit.  If anyone finds a signature of the name of\nmy son with any creditor let it be known that the signature is not\ngenuine and does not have validity since he did not sign it.  A noble\nlord prescribed that I bring some one to vouch for me or else that my\nson should sign with me.  Since my son was not in Poland at the time\nbut abroad and I did not want to reveal this to any one, I brought my\nservant and he signed for my son.  My son did not know of this.\nIt grieves me that now too he is not in Poland and I shall never see\nhim again.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">All the above was pronounced before us, the\nundersigned, by Gutman Rakowski, of blessed memory, head\nand <I>parnes</I> of the community,\nwhile imprisoned by the Confederates in Lanckorona.  He made this will\nand read it to us before be died and while of sound mind.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">To this we testify in best of faith and attach our\nsignature, this 18th day of June 1771.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">(Signed) LEWEK JACHIMOWICZ</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">YISROEL DAWIDOWICZ</P>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 1167.0}
