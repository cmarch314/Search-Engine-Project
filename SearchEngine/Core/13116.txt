We show that, if this set has\nsize k, it is possible to handle this problem in space O(k log\nn) by a deterministic data structure. However, if check-outs may occur\nthat do not match any check-in, then no low-space deterministic solution\nis possible; instead, we provide a randomized solution with near-optimal\nspace and high probability of answering queries correctly.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"EppGoo-WADS-07.pdf\">WADS talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>On verifying and engineering the well-gradedness of a\nunion-closed family</b>.<br>\nD.
