The author considers here a recent work of Bern, Mitchell and Ruppert which uses circle packings to generate such meshes and speed up a key step of their method in which circles are packed into a non-simply connected polygonal region to connect its boundary components. \n\nIn the work of Bern et al., this step was computed in $O(n\\log\\sp {2}n)$ time. The new method presented here leads to an overall speedup of a logarithmic factor, which makes the whole algorithm work in total time $O(n\\log n)$. \n\nThis method for connecting the boundary components of a polygon relies on a combination of several known techniques such as: Voronoi diagrams, minimum spanning trees, intersection graphs, neighborhood system algorithms of Eppstein, Miller and Teng, and dynamic tree techniques of Sleator and Tarjan.\n</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"navbar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t[<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/\">D.
