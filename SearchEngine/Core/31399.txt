PowerGlove Serial Interface to a Silicon Graphics 4D 35G workstation This glove definitely falls into the category of cheap and nasty Position information is calculated on the basis of ultrasound emissions from emitters the glove to a 3 microphone L Bar that sits atop a monitor There are two emitters on the glove and three receivers This allows the calculation of 4 pieces of information x left right y up down z backward forward and roll is the palm pointing up or down x y and z are measured with 8 bit accuracy x y z should not be taken to be the normal 3 dimensional orthogonal basis In particular 1 unit in the z direction is not of similar distance to 1 unit in the x or y directions These x y z positions are relative to a calibration point which is when the palm is resting on the seated signer s thigh Roll is 4 bits The data is susceptible to occasional spikes caused by random ultrasound noise Median filters have been found to be beneficial in solving this problem Finger bend is generated by conductive bend sensors on the first four fingers Values vary between straight and 3 fully bent Accuracy is 2 bits The gloves automatically apply a hysteresis filter on these bend sensors At best these measurements should be treated sceptically See past usage for a more detailed discussion on the data collection methodology Signers The data was collected from five signers Signer Description Sessions Total samples sign Adam Sign linguist PhD completed in area 2 8 Andrew Natural signer signing since youth 3 8 John Professional Auslan interpreter 5 18 Stephen Professional Auslan interpreter 4 16 Waleed The researcher Novice signer 4 2 Each session was taken at a different time after a break etc Special notes The adam dataset were sampled in a fixed order this means that they are subject to fatigue effects etc All other datasets were sampled in random order The waleed and stephen datasets contain signs that begin with cal These were considered as a means of calibration but didn t work out too well Preprocessing The data presented is the raw data with no filtering Variable Descriptions x Continuous Description x position between 1 and 1 Units are approximately metres y Continuous Description y position between 1 and 1 Units are approximately metres z Continuous Description z position between 1 and 1 Units are not metres This space should not really be treated as linear although it is safe to treat it as monotonically increasing roll Continuous Description roll with meaning palm down rotating clcokwise through to a maximum of 1 not included which is also palm down pitch Has a value of 1 indicating that it is not available for this data Should be ignored yaw Has a value of 1 indicating that it is not available for this data Should be ignored thumb Continuous Description Thumb bend has a value of straight to 1 fully bent fore Continuous Description Forefinger bend has a value of straight to 1 fully bent index Continuous Description Index finger bend has a value of straight to 1 fully bent ring Continuous Description Ring finger bend has a value of straight to 1 fully bent little In this case it is a copy of ring bend Should be ignored keycode Indicates which key was pressed on the glove Should be ignored gs1 glove state 1 Should be ignored gs2 glove state 2 should be ignored Receiver values Determines if all receivers received values from all transmitters A value of x3F indicates all receivers received information from all transmitters Other values indicate this is not the case Anomalies Occasional dropouts in x y z values These can be easily fixed using a median filter Other Relevant Information Average number of frames per instance is 51 but varies from 3 to 1 2 Data Format The data is in a comma separated file containing all of the attributes mentioned above Each sign sample is stored in a single file The directory hierarchy is as follows Each signer is in a separate directory Each session from signer is in a subdirectory Each session is denoted by a number Each sample is in a file named by the sample appended with the number of the sample of that sign The filenames indicate the

Position information is calculated on the basis of ultrasound\nemissions from emitters the glove to a 3-microphone \"L-Bar\" that sits\natop a monitor. There are two emitters on the glove; and three\nreceivers. This allows the calculation of 4 pieces of information: x\n(left/right), y (up/down), z (backward/forward), and roll (is the palm\npointing up or down?). x, y and z are measured with 8 bit\naccuracy. \"x, y, z\" should not be taken to be the normal 3-dimensional\northogonal basis. In particular, 1 unit in the z direction is not\nof similar distance to 1 unit in the x or y directions. These x, y, z\npositions are relative to a calibration point which is when the palm\nis resting on the seated signer's thigh. Roll is 4 bits.\n</P>\n\n<P>\nThe data is susceptible to occasional \"spikes\" caused by random\nultrasound noise. Median filters have been found to be beneficial in\nsolving this problem. \n</P>\n\n<P>\nFinger bend is generated by conductive bend sensors on the first four\nfingers. Values vary between 0 (straight) and 3 (fully bent).\nAccuracy is 2 bits. The gloves automatically apply a hysteresis filter\non these bend sensors.
