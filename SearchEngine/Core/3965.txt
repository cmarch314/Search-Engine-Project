This advantage is important for massively parallel rendering\nmethods, where there are many rays in flight. On SIMD architectures, a\ncommonly used acceleration structure is the MBVH, which has multiple\nbounding boxes per node for improved parallelism. It scales to\nbranching factors higher than two, for which, however, only\nstack-based traversal methods have been proposed so far. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel stackless traversal algorithm for MBVHs\nwith up to four-way branching. Our approach replaces the stack with a\nsmall bitmask, supports dynamic ordered traversal, and has a low\ncomputation overhead.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3965.0}
