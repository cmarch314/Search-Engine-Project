The purpose of information\nintegration is to support seamless access to these data sources. To deal\nwith source heterogeneity, many systems use a mediation architecture, in\nwhich a mediator processes user queries by accessing source data. There\nare two approaches to information integration: the source-centric approach\n(taken by the TSIMMIS system at Stanford), and the query-centric approach\n(taken by many systems, such as the Information Manifold at AT&amp;T).  My\nthesis focuses on efficient query processing in both approaches. In the\nfirst approach, I work on how to process queries efficiently when sources\nhave limited capabilities of answering queries. In the second approach, I\ndevelop query-optimization techniques, such as how to use mediator caching\nto improve query performance, and how to generate efficient rewritings of\nqueries using views. Most of my thesis work is developed in the TSIMMIS\nproject at Stanford University.\n\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"thesis-chenli.ps\">ps</A> (2.5M)</LI>\n\n<LI><A HREF=\"thesis-chenli.ps.gz\">ps.gz</A> (0.71M)</LI>\n\n<LI>\n<A HREF=\"thesis-chenli.pdf\">pdf</A> (1.3M)</LI>\n\n<LI><A HREF=\"thesis-chenli.pdf.gz\">pdf.gz</A>(0.98M)</LI>\n</UL>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 8585.0}
