In order to connect to Chimera, the applet requires a username.\nSince Java restrictions prevent the applet from determining this information\nautomatically, the applet must query the user for the information. Alternatively,\nthis information could be conveyed to the applet using an applet parameter.\nHowever in order to be sufficiently general, this approach implies that\nthe Web page which hosts the applet is generated dynamically by the Web\nserver. This, in turn, implies that the Web server has, in some fashion,\npreviously determined the user's name (e.g., via an HTML form).</TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><IMG SRC=\"../../images/arch2.2.gif\" WIDTH=\"575\" HEIGHT=\"281\" NATURALSIZEFLAG=\n\"0\" ALIGN=\"BOTTOM\"></TD></TR>\n<TR>\n<TD><B>Step three.</B> The applet contacts the hyperweb manager on the site\nfrom which it was downloaded and requests the contact information of a Chimera\nserver running on the site.
