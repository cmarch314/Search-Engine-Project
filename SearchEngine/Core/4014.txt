There are many challenges to a VOD\nserver, and load balancing is the most important one. A server must\nhave movie files organized in such a way that all clients can view\nthe movies they want, regardless of the number of clients who are\nonline. There may be peak time periods when many clients want to\nview the same movie, and the server must send different phases of\nthe same movie file to them, since the clients do not all request\nthe movie at the same time. The server must also minimize the\nwaiting time for each client. The cost must be kept low, but the\nnumber of files and bandwidth must be large enough to service all\nclients promptly. The goal of load balancing is to maximize the\nratio of the number of concurrent streams over the cost of the\nserver.</p>\n\n<p>Another challenge is the online functionalities at the client's\nend. A client must be able to perform the VCR-like functions, such\nas fast-forward, rewind, pause, etc... on the movies they are\nviewing, the same way as when they rent and watch a video tape with\ntheir VCR. Therefore, it's not enough if a steady stream of movie\nfile comes to their house without the client being able to\ninterfere with it.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I will survey a number of articles which appeared\nrecently about this type of multimedia. These are the contributions\nby the people who have studied the details of a VOD server, the\nproblems that are involved, and the solutions for those\nproblems.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4014.0}
