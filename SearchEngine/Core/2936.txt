automatic deadline of 11 59 pm on the given due date No homeworks will be accepted after that time I know this is a tough requirement but in return I ll award extra credit for early submitted homeworks as described below If you are working down to the last minute please make sure something is uploaded 1 minutes prior to the deadline to ensure you won t get zero credit Grading Each assignment has both programming and written components Your code will be graded both on clarity and correctness It is generally more important that your code be clear and correct than fast Your writeup should be richly illustrated with graphs and images and your code should be well commented and documented Extra credit Any homework that is handed in one day early 11 59 pm on the previous day will get 1 extra credit e g 5 points for a 5 point assignment Homework Submission Instructions Submit a zip or tar archive containing your code and your HTML writeup into the appropriate directory in the EEE Dropbox Use the following directory structure YourName code YourName html The code subdirectory should contain all of your code Include everything that your code needs to run If I hand out code as part of the assignment include that also The html subdirectory should contain your writeup including images and figures I and you should be able to point a web browswer at that directory to view your writeup Zip or tar the YourName directory and submit either YourName zip or YourName tar gz or YourName tgz or a URL to the file to the instructor via email You can create an archive of the YourName directory in various ways Right click on the folder and select Create archive Select either zip or tar gz to create the archive or In a terminal cd to the directory containing YourName and type zip r YourName YourName to create YourName zip or In the terminal type tar cfz YourName tgz YourName to create YourName tgz You can list the contents of a zip archive with the command unzip l YourName and the contents of a tar archive with the command tar tfz YourName tgz Homework Writeup Guidelines You must submit your writeups as as a single HTML web page HTML makes it easy to include links to high resolution images as well as video in your writeups I will not accept writeups in any word processing format such as MS Word or Open Office If you don t know how to create an HTML document look at this quick tutorial that includes a writeup template Any figure or image in your writeup should be small enough to fit on both the screen and the printed page The web page should therefore be not wider than 65 pixels I will print out your assignments for grading purposes on a nice color laser printer so this is important Large images and figures do not belong in the main text of your writeup If you need to show image details in a figure then zoom into the image You may provide links to high resolution images in the HTML but huge images should not appear on the main writeup page Some guidelines for your figures Use a proper size and aspect ratio If you are showing an image make sure that the pixels are displayed square Use the axis image command If the image is not too large ensure that image and screen pixels coincide with the truesize command Always show the colorbar for 2D data Whether your are showing an image or data in the form of an image always show the colorbar If you are showing an image this will verify that the color map spans the correct range usually 1 If you are showing data then this will show the meaning of the colors The only exception is when you show RGB images in that case the colorbar is meaningless because the colormap is not used Use a sensible color map There are 3 standard color maps available to you gray jet and hsv In the few cases where your data is periodic such as with angles then use colormap hsv Otherwise use gray or jet Which is appropriate depends on what you are trying to show Use the colormap that most effectively communicates your point Use a proper display range If you are showing a grayscale image make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors The imagesc command has an optional parameter for this purpose e g imagesc im 1 will make sure the color map spans the range 1 If you are showing data then allowing imagesc to scale the color map to the range of the data is usually appropriate If your data is mostly symmetric around zero then consider using a display range that is symmetric around zero e g imagesc im 1 1 max abs im Consider screen capture for figures There are three ways to create images of your figures Use a screen capture utility Select File Save As from the figure window and export as an image PNG TIFF JPG etc Use the print command Use imwrite for saving images To directly export an image from Matlab use the imwrite command ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dramanan/teaching/cs116_fall08/hw/", "title": "cs116 comp photo and vision/ fall 2008", "html": "<html>\n\n<head>\n\n

will only be accepted electronically through the EEE dropbox. The dropbox will have a automatic deadline of 11:59 pm on the given due date. <i> No homeworks will be accepted after that time</i>. I know this is a tough requirement, but in return, I'll award extra credit for early-submitted homeworks as described below. If you are working down to the last minute, <b> please </b> make sure something is uploaded 10 minutes prior to the deadline to ensure you won't get zero credit.\n\n\n    <h3>Grading</h3>\n    \n    Each assignment has both programming and written components.  Your\n    code will be graded both on clarity and correctness.  \n    It is generally more important that your code be clear and\n    correct than fast.  Your writeup should \n    be richly illustrated with graphs and images, and your code\n    should be well commented and documented.\n\n    <h3>Extra-credit</h3>      \n      Any homework that is handed in one day early (11:59 pm on the previous day) will get 10% extra-credit - e.g., 5 points for a 50-point assignment.\n    \n\n    <h3>Homework Submission Instructions</h3>\n    \n    <p> Submit a zip or tar archive containing your\n      code and your HTML writeup into the appropriate directory in the <tt>EEE Dropbox</tt>.  Use the following directory structure:\n      \n    <blockquote><tt><pre>\nYourName/code\nYourName/html\n      </pre></tt></blockquote>\n    \n    <p>\n      The <tt>code</tt> subdirectory should contain all of your code.  Include\n      everything that your code needs to run.  If I hand out code as part of the\n      assignment, include that also.\n      The <tt>html</tt> subdirectory should contain your writeup, including \n      images and figures.  I (and you) should be able to point \n      a web browswer at that directory to view your writeup.  \n      \n      \n    <p>\n      Zip or tar the <tt>YourName</tt> \n      directory and submit either <tt>YourName.zip</tt> or \n      <tt>YourName.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>YourName.tgz</tt> or a URL\n      to the file to the instructor via email.  You can create an archive\n      of the <tt>YourName</tt> directory in various ways:\n      \n    <p>\n    <ul>\n      <li> Right-click on the folder and select \"Create archive\".\n\tSelect either \"zip\" or \"tar.gz\" to create the archive, or\n      <li> In a terminal, cd to the directory\n\tcontaining <tt>YourName</tt> and type <tt>zip -r YourName\n\t  YourName</tt> to create <tt>YourName.zip</tt>, or\n      <li> In the terminal, type <tt>tar cfz YourName.tgz YourName</tt>\n\t\n\tto create <tt>YourName.tgz</tt>.\n    </ul>\n    \n    <p>You can list the contents of a zip archive with the command\n      <tt>unzip -l YourName</tt> and the contents of a tar archive with\n      the command <tt>tar tfz YourName.tgz</tt>.\n      \n    <h3>Homework Writeup Guidelines</h3>\n    \n    <p>\n      You must submit your writeups as as a single HTML web page.  HTML\n      makes it easy to include\n      links to high resolution images as well as video in your writeups.\n      <em>I will not accept writeups in any word processing format\n\tsuch as MS Word or Open Office.</em>  \n      \n      \n    <p>If you don't know how to create an HTML document look at\n      this <a href=\"htmlTutorial.shtml\">quick tutorial</a> that includes a\n      <a href=\"template\">writeup template</a>.\n      \n    <p><em>Any figure or image in your writeup should be small enough to\n\tfit on both the screen and the printed page.</em>  The web page\n      should therefore be not wider than 650 pixels.  I will print out\n      your assignments for grading purposes on a nice color laser printer,\n      so this is important.  Large images and figures do not belong in the\n      main text of your writeup.  If you need to show image details in a\n      figure, then zoom into the image.  You may provide links to high\n      resolution images in the HTML, but huge images should \n      not appear on the main writeup page.\n      \n    <p>Some guidelines for your figures:\n      \n    <ul>\n      \n\t<p><li><b>Use a proper size and aspect ratio.</b>  If you are showing\n\tan image, make sure that the pixels are displayed square.  Use\n\tthe <tt>axis image</tt> command.  If the image is not too large,\n\tensure that image and screen pixels coincide with the\n\t\n\t<tt>truesize</tt> command.\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Always show the colorbar for 2D data.</b>  Whether your are\n\tshowing an image or data in the form of an image, always show the\n\tcolorbar.  If you are showing an image, this will verify that the\n\tcolor map spans the correct range (usually <tt>[0,1]</tt>).  If\n\tyou are showing data, then this will show the meaning of the colors.\n\tThe only exception is when you show RGB images; in that case, the\n\tcolorbar is meaningless because the colormap is not used.\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Use a sensible color map.</b>  There are 3 standard color\n\tmaps available to you: <tt>gray</tt>, <tt>jet</tt>,\n\tand <tt>hsv</tt>.  In the few cases where your data is periodic\n\t(such as with angles), then use <tt>colormap hsv</tt>.  Otherwise,\n\tuse <tt>gray</tt> or <tt>jet</tt>.  Which is appropriate\n\tdepends on what you are trying to show.  Use the colormap that most\n\teffectively communicates your point.\n\t\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Use a proper display range.</b>  If you are showing a\n\tgrayscale image, make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors.\n\tThe <tt>imagesc</tt> command has an optional parameter for this\n\tpurpose, e.g. <tt>imagesc(im,[0,1])</tt> will make sure the color\n\tmap spans the range <tt>[0,1]</tt>.  If you are showing data, then\n\tallowing <tt>imagesc</tt> to scale the color map to the range of\n\tthe data is usually appropriate.  If your data is mostly symmetric\n\taround zero, then consider using a display range that is symmetric\n\taround zero,\n\te.g. <nobr><tt>imagesc(im,[-1,1]*max(abs(im(:))))</tt></nobr>\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Consider screen capture for figures.</b>  There are\n\tthree ways to create images of your figures:  \n\t<p>\n\t<ul>\n\t  <li> Use a screen capture utility.  \n\t  <li> Select File > Save As... from the figure window, and export as\n\t    an image (PNG, TIFF, JPG, etc.).\n\t  <li> Use the <tt>print</tt> command.\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<p><li><b>Use imwrite() for saving images.</b>  To directly export\n\tan image from Matlab, use the <tt>imwrite</tt> command.  \n\t\n\t\n    </ul>\n    <hr>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2936.0}
