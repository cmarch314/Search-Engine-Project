Using\nknown algorithms one can solve this in O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time\nand in O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) space. We show that it is possible\nto find a shortest path in time\nO(<i>n</i><sup>1.5</sup>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) and space\nO(<i>n</i><sup>1.5</sup>). Furthermore, if only one path endpoint\nis known in advance, it is possible to preprocess the arrangement\nin the same time and space and then find shortest paths for query\npoints in time O(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>).</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4086.0}
