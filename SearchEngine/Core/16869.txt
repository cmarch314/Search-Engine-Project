Existing approaches separate partitioning\nand scheduling in two steps. Since partitioning solutions\naffect scheduling results and vice versa, the existing\nsequential approaches may lead to sub-optimal results.\nIn this paper, we present an integrated hardware/software\nscheduling, partitioning and binding strategy. We use dynamic\nprogramming techniques to devise an optimal solution\nfor partitioning of a given concurrent task graph, which\nmodels the co-design problem, for execution on one software\n(single CPU) and several hardware resources (multiple\nFPGA's), with the objective of minimizing the total execution\ntime. Our implementation shows that we can solve\nproblem instances where the task graph has 40 nodes and\n600 edges in less than a second.\n<p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Department of Computer Science and Engineering,<br>\n      Indian Institue of Technology, Delhi.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "id": 16869.0}
