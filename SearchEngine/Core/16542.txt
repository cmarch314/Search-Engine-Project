the End of the TunnelProject 2 Black and WhiteProject 3 Standing Outside of a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My HandProject 4 Rock and Roll Stops the TrafficProject 5 CANCELED Introduction This quarter much of your focus will be on the programming projects found here While this is a course that is partially about the analysis of data structures and algorithms understanding how well things work at a level above the low level implementation details it is also a course about their implementation and these projects will focus your attention on the implementation side Building on your work in ICS 45C or related coursework elsewhere all of these projects will be written entirely in C Some of them will require you to master new C skills beyond what was taught in ICS 45C but having completed ICS 45C or an equivalent course you should find yourself able to adapt and grow to meet this course s needs If you ve never programmed in C before you may find yourself overmatched here and it would be wise for you to take ICS 45C before taking this course Note that C programming requires a level of care and attention to detail that exceeds what you may have experienced in languages you ve used previously requiring a dual focus on both higher level abstractions and low level implementation details that many languages hide and or handle automatically though a focus on these kinds of details is an important part of the kind of work we re doing here regardless of programming language Each of these projects focuses on one particular kind of algorithm or data structure though each attempts to place that underlying problem into a broader more interesting context I hope you ll find these projects interesting and exciting and that you ll discover at the end of the quarter that you ve built skills and continued to broaden and deepen your programming skills Evaluation of your work Evaluation criteria Each of your projects will be graded on a 3 point scale with the points split albeit unevenly into two categories correctness and robustness i e does the program work and quality and design i e how well is the program written They are described in more detail below CriteriaValueDescriptionCorrectness and robustness2 points Summary Does the program do what it s supposed to do for any input that meets the project specifications When the program is given valid input does it generate the output specified Is the output spacing and case correct if these are specified When the program is given unusual or erroneous input and the project write up doesn t specifically forbid us from testing it is it handled gracefully Are all resources allocated by the program e g memory open files released before the program ends Quality and design1 points Summary Strive to write a clear well organized readable modifiable program Your program should be divided into logical parts each encapsulating a single task or idea Large functions or classes should be broken up into smaller ones that do simpler jobs Identifier names should be chosen to reflect their objective the names should be meaningful to the reader Comments should be included where necessary to introduce clarity for the reader though it should be noted that good modularity and well named identifiers make the commenting burden significantly lighter Any other rules and or limitations specified in the project write up should have been followed TOTAL3 points Code that does not compile If you submit a program that does not compile we will not be able to execute it and thus will not be able to evaluate its correctness It is your responsibility to turn in code that compiles and it s important that it compiles in the development environment specified for this course more about that below Though we will make an honest effort to assess its overall correctness and quality we can at our discretion assign a score as low as zero to a program that does not compile and you can assume that your score on such a program will not necessarily apporach the percentage of completeness and correctness you actually achieved as it is impossible for us to measure that without being able to run and test your program At the level of experience that is assumed of you you should be able to ensure that code compiles even in a partially completed program you should be able to work incrementally save copies when you reach stable state and so on You might also consider using a source control tool like Git which helps you to formalize this kind of incremental work though this is not required If you ve never used a source control tool before it would be worth the effort spent to learn about one given its flexibility and popularity in professional and open source circles Git is a very good choice If you prefer something else feel free to use it Git is installed on the ICS 46 VM but you can install other systems on to the VM pretty easily if you re so inclined Late work Things happen and ten week quarters can be unforgiving It s not unreasonable to expect that you may find it difficult to finish one of the projects on time even if you re on top of things most of the time I get emails often from students saying things like If I just had one more day to work on this I d get it done On the other hand being consistently behind is a recipe for struggle in this course we ll be moving quickly and it will be progressively harder to catch up the farther behind you get The best balance between these two realities is that everyone is allowed to have a tough time with a project once this quarter maybe you underestimated the difficulty of an assignment maybe you have three midterms and a paper due the same day maybe you have a sudden outside commitment that can t be avoided For this reason I m offering the following late work policy Each student is permitted to submit any one project up to 48 hours late with no questions asked about why and no prior notification required For the purposes of clarification here are some additional details about how this policy works You are not required to notify us in advance in fact in all honesty we d prefer that you didn t There are a lot of students in this course so that would represent a lot of extra work for us We ll be looking for submissions up to 48 hours beyond the deadline of each project There is a ten minute grace period after the due date allowing you time to get your files submitted to Checkmate If you submitted your files at 12 8am for an 11 59pm due date you re fine Best not to play with fire though if you re already done before 11 59pm at 12 11am you ll have used up your one time extension No exceptions The first project that you submit late will fall under this policy any subsequent project you submit late will not be accepted In other words you can t submit two projects late then wait to see which one you get a better score on we won t be grading the second one If any one file is submitted beyond the ten minute grace period the entire project is considered late We ll be tracking this throughout the quarter and of course will not grant the extension to anyone more than once But this should accommodate the unforeseen issues that might otherwise prevent you from finishing a project on time Other than this late work is not accepted in this course Out of the ordinary circumstances sometimes warrant exceptions to this policy if you are faced with a problem that is preventing you from getting your work done on time either on a single assignment or chronically please contact me and we can talk about how best to approach the problem It s important to contact me sooner rather than later earlier in the quarter there are a lot more things I can do to help than there are in the tenth week Development environment Unlike programming languages such as Java or Python which make it a point to be more or less independent of the platform i e the hardware the operating system etc that they run on C is decidedly platform dependent This is especially true in the last couple of years or so as a new version of the C Standard called C 11 has been released but not all compiler implementers have implemented all of the new features of the language yet and library support is even more hit or miss And even amongst the features that all compilers share there are differences all the way down to details such as the maximum value you can store in a variable of type int that make it important for us to agree on a single development environment a particular compiler running on a particular operating system Because not every one of you will be running the same operating system on your own machine and to avoid the problem of having each of you install and configure the necessary software yourselves the officially supported development environment for ICS 46 is provided in the form of a virtual machine a complete environment that includes an operating system compiler debugger text editors and so on we ll call this the ICS 46 VM Rather than installing software you ll download the ICS 46 VM and run it as an application on your computer but log into it as though it was a separate computer This is explained in more detail in Project which describes how to download it and set it up for use What if I don t want to use the ICS 46 VM You should be aware that at least some of the project work this quarter will require the ICS 46 VM it may be possible to work around it but you might find that it s a lot of work and we won t be able to support you in it While everything we do this quarter will be standard C 11 I ll be using third party libraries e g a GUI library called Qt and I ll sometimes be providing you code in compiled form rather than giving you source code Incompatibilities between compilers linkers and operating systems will likely make it difficult or impossible to use that pre compiled code on machines other than the ICS 46 VM So in general you can use whatever you want but you might find it a very difficult thing to do your best bet is to acclimate yourself to the ICS 46 VM Be aware that we will be grading your work using the ICS 46 VM so at minimum you should always test your projects in the ICS 46 VM before submitting your work Submitting work that compiles on your favorite compiler but not in the ICS 46 VM is viewed the same as any other work that does not compile at all as when you work for or with someone else professionally you don t always get to choose your favorite environment to work and have to adapt to what is appropriate to the situation Additionally be aware that you re on your own to get software other than the ICS 46 VM set up and configured we can t realistically support everyone s separate home installation whereas the ICS 46 VM gives us a single system to support Also and especially if you ve never used Linux before or spent a lot of time on a command line you should consider the practical usefulness of learning new skills that will no doubt prove to be valuable as you pursue professional and academic options further down the line Trying out something new while having the safety net of a large course staff to help you is a lot better than struggling with it on your own Even if only for that reason I d strongly encourage you to use the ICS 46 VM for all of your work even if it seems like a difficult transition at first Linux and command lines are an important part of real world computing and you would be wise to gain some experience with them What I want to use a previous ICS 45C VM instead Unfortunately the ICS 45C VM from a previous iteration of ICS 45C is unlikely to work for you this quarter as the set of software installed this quarter is not the same and since the ICS 45C VM contained scripts and templates specific to that course You ll need to obtain the ICS 46 VM and use it though you ll find it a familiar environment as it s based on the same version of Linux and its configuration is similar Submitting your projects When you complete each project you must submit it to us electronically to a web based system called Checkmate Follow this link for a detailed description of how to submit your projects via Checkmate Understand that we will only accept projects submitted using the procedure described there we do not accept printed copies of your projects nor do we accept them via email under any circumstances You are responsible for submitting the version of your project that you want graded We will grade the most recent submission made before the deadline Accidentally submitting the wrong version will not be considered grounds for a regrade Academic honesty The policy As ICS 46 or CSE 46 students you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole Please take a few minutes to read the policies which can be found at this link All of your lab work is expected to be completed solely by you Worker in larger groups and or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted Note that high level discussion of course material for better understanding is permitted and encouraged but when it comes time to sit down and write code that is expected to be done by you and you alone All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions even when there are superficial differences Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in or even refer to code written by a friend of yours who took the course already Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else s work Academic honesty is a two way street Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted anymore than turning in someone else s code Resist the temptation to give code to your friends for reference Based on my experience I can say that your friends may very well betray you and turn it in anyway Naturally the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors registering for computing minors joining the ICS Honors Program and graduating from a computing major with honors The lesson Okay so the moral of the story is that it s wise to avoid cheating I believe that it s relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it why come to UCI if you re not planning to get something out of the coursework So why do people cheat every quarter in every course The answers vary but here s the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I ve had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years I fell behind and couldn t figure out how to catch up Things happen and ten week quarters are unforgiving You might get sick you might have issues crop up in your family you might have an off campus job that s demanding too much of your time you might be trying to decide whether you re on the path you want to be on Any of those things and many others can make it hard to keep up You fall a little behind you fall a little further behind and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless You re under pressure temptation gets the better of you If you feel like you re beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control the best thing to do is to talk to us sooner rather than later We re here to help we understand But the reality of taking large sized courses at a large sized institution is that we re not going to know you re in need unless you tell us If things are happening in your life tell us you don t have to be specific if you re not comfortable with it Before the fact there s often a way to work things out After the fact it s usually too late Originally written by Alex Thornton Fall 2 13 with heavy

It's not unreasonable to expect that you may find it difficult to finish one of the projects on time, even if you're on top of things most of the time.  I get emails often from students, saying things like <i>If I just had one more day to work on this, I'd get it done!</i>  On the other hand, being consistently behind is a recipe for struggle in this course; we'll be moving quickly, and it will be progressively harder to catch up the farther behind you get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best balance between these two realities is that everyone is allowed to have a tough time with a project once this quarter &mdash; maybe you underestimated the difficulty of an assignment, maybe you have three midterms and a paper due the same day, maybe you have a sudden outside commitment that can't be avoided.  For this reason, I'm offering the following late work policy:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Each student is permitted to submit any one project up to 48 hours late, with no questions asked about why and no prior notification required.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purposes of clarification, here are some additional details about how this policy works:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>You are not required to notify us in advance &mdash; in fact, in all honesty, we'd prefer that you didn't.  (There are a lot of students in this course, so that would represent a lot of extra work for us.)  We'll be looking for submissions up to 48 hours beyond the deadline of each project.</li>\r\n  <li>There is a ten-minute grace period after the due date, allowing you time to get your files submitted to Checkmate.  If you submitted your files at 12:08am for an 11:59pm due date, you're fine.  Best not to play with fire, though, if you're already done before 11:59pm; at 12:11am, you'll have used up your one-time extension.  <i>No exceptions!</i></li>\r\n  <li>The first project that you submit late will fall under this policy; any subsequent project you submit late will not be accepted.  (In other words, you can't submit two projects late, then wait to see which one you get a better score on; we won't be grading the second one.)</li>\r\n  <li>If any one file is submitted beyond the ten-minute grace period, the entire project is considered late.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We'll be tracking this throughout the quarter and, of course, will not grant the extension to anyone more than once.

Accidentally submitting the wrong version will not be considered grounds for a regrade.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Academic honesty</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ICS 46 or CSE 46 students, you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole.  Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of your lab work is expected to be completed <i>solely by you</i>.  Worker in larger groups and/or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted.  Note that \"high-level discussion of course material for better understanding\" is permitted and encouraged, but when it comes time to sit down and write code, that is expected to be done by you and you alone.  All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system.  This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions, even when there are superficial differences.  (Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter, so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in, or even refer to, code written by a friend of yours who took the course already.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you, you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else's work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Academic honesty is a two-way street.  Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted anymore than turning in someone else's code.  Resist the temptation to give code to your friends \"for reference.\"  Based on my experience, I can say that your \"friends\" may very well betray you and turn it in, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts.  Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy.  They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade.  Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The lesson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so the moral of the story is that it's wise to avoid cheating.  I believe that it's relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it; why come to UCI if you're not planning to get something out of the coursework?  So why do people cheat every quarter in every course?  The answers vary, but here's the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I've had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years: <i>I fell behind and couldn't figure out how to catch up</i>.  Things happen and ten-week quarters are unforgiving.  You might get sick, you might have issues crop up in your family, you might have an off-campus job that's demanding too much of your time, you might be trying to decide whether you're on the path you want to be on... Any of those things (and many others) can make it hard to keep up.  You fall a little behind, you fall a little further behind, and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless.  You're under pressure, temptation gets the better of you...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel like you're beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control, the best thing to do is to talk to us <i>sooner rather than later</i>.  We're here to help; we understand.  But the reality of taking large-sized courses at a large-sized institution is that we're not going to know you're in need unless you tell us.  If things are happening in your life, tell us; you don't have to be specific if you're not comfortable with it.  Before the fact, there's often a way to work things out.  After the fact, it's usually too late.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"history\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\r\n  <li>Originally written by Alex Thornton, Fall 2013, with heavy influence in some sections from the Project Guide from the most recent iteration of ICS 65</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 16542.0}
