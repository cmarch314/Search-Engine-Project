of computational photography Computational photography is an emerging field at the intersection of vision graphics and increasingly machine learning It deals with computational mechanisms for creating enhancing and interpreting digital images The course will describe algorithmic techniques for low level image understanding including applications such as geometric reconstruction warping registration denoising deblurring and hole filling blending The course will also introduce high level algorithms for image understanding including object recognition and detection Students will acquire knowledge of image formation including camera optics imaging transformations and basic image processing The course assumes a background knowledge of linear algebra and probability but will introduce linear

</span>\nThis class introduces the computational and mathematical problems of computer vision through the umbrella application of computational photography. Computational photography is an emerging field at the intersection of vision, graphics, and increasingly, machine learning. It deals with computational mechanisms for creating, enhancing, and interpreting digital images. The course will describe algorithmic techniques for low-level image understanding, including applications such as geometric reconstruction, warping & registration, denoising & deblurring, and hole-filling & blending. The course will also introduce high-level algorithms for image understanding including object recognition and detection.\n\nStudents will acquire knowledge of image formation, including camera optics, imaging transformations, and basic image processing. The course assumes a background knowledge of linear algebra and probability, but will introduce linear least squares, classification, and dynamic programming.\n\nThe class will emphasize hands-on implementation of the presented algorithms through numerous (5) project assignments. Students will be encouraged to acquire their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes for the project assignments. To validate the presented material, there will also be a final exam.<br>\n<br>\n<b> Prerequisite:</b><br>\nCS 6D/Mathematics 6D, Mathematics 6G or 3A, Mathematics 2A-B, CS 23.
