MMVEs will have a\ntremendous impact on the way the Internet will evolve in the future due\nto their interactive and real-time nature. Online computer\ngaming/simulation is forecasted to become one of the most demanding\napplications on the Internet. Researchers in the networking arena need\nto be prepared to meet that challenge, and our success will depend very\nmuch on how well we understand the requirements of this new class of\napplications.</span><br style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">With the anticipated growth in this\napplication area, we will be seeing more and more stress being placed\non the underlying transport infrastructure to provide the kind of\nquality of experience (QoE) that these applications and their users\nexpect. The quality of an end user&#8217;s experience is the true litmus test\nof a proper online game deployment. Only by understanding both the\napplication needs and the underlying network facilities can one design\nnetworking mechanisms and develop pre and post processing schemes to\nensure the required QoE.
