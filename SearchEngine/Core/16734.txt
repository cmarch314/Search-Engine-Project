This presentation focuses on the application of\nactivity theory in industrial software engineering (design, development\nand maintenance).\n<p>\nVarious data collection methodologies can be applied for gathering\ndata from situated work. Ethnography is one particular qualitative\nmethodology for data collection in a natural setting. Activity Theory\nis a socio-cultural theory that lends useful models to analyze the data\ncollected from ethnography. The models we have adopted from Activity\nTheory serve as a lens to interpret data we have collected from software\nmaintenance and customer support settings.\n<p>\nActivity Theory helps us understand the multi-dimensional nature of\ncustomer support \"systems\". We provide specific examples of the\napplication of Activity Theory and ethnographic methods\nto identifying improvements in workflow processes and tools.\n<p>\n<strong>Biographies:</strong>\n<p>\nPatricia Collins is a researcher at Hewlett-Packard\nLaboratories where she has focused most recently on technology\nstrategies for the knowledge engineering-management lifecycle. Her\nprevious research was in the area of software reuse, especially domain\nanalysis and the use of capability-readiness models for developing\norganizational development roadmaps in software reuse. Patricia holds a\nMSEE from Stanford University and a B.A. in mathematics and philosophy\nfrom Dickinson College.\n<p>\nShilpa Shukla is a Doctoral student in the Information and\nComputer Science Department at the University of California Irvine. Her\nresearch focuses on studying the bug management workflow processes using\na data collection methodology known as ethnography. Shilpa combines\nsoftware engineering theories with a socio-cultural theory to analyze\nethnographic data. Previously she studied Apple's bug tracking and\nHP's customer support processes. The results of her analysis are\nintended to help software researchers better understand and design\nbug management processes. Shilpa holds a Masters from University of\nCalifornia Irvine in Human Computer Interaction and a B.S. in\nInformation and Computer Science with a focus on sofware engineering.\n\n<p>\n\n<font size=+1>\n<b>Meeting Coordinator:</b><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
