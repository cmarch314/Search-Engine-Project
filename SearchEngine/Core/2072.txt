Although there have been many papers on the\n<i>k</i> shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become\nfrequently cited in those application areas.\nAdditionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:\nprior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could\nbe solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time\nbounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead\non devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative\nformulations of the problem that avoid the repeated\nvertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by\nthis formulation.\n<p>(<a href=\"/~eppstein/bibs/eppstein.html#Finding the $k$ shortest paths\">BibTeX</a> --\n<a href=\"Epp-SJC-98.pdf\">Full paper</a> --\n<a href=\"http://fano.ics.uci.edu/cites/Document/Finding-the-k-shortest-paths.html\">Citations</a> --\n<a href=\"graehl.zip\">Graehl implementation</a> --\n<a href=\"http://terra.act.uji.es/REA/\">Jim&eacute;nez-Marzal implementations</a> --\n<a href=\"Shibuya.tar.gz\">Shibuya implementation</a> --\n<a href=\"http://www.mat.uc.pt/~eqvm/cientificos/research.html\">Martins implementation</a> --\nCiteSeer:\n<a href=\"http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/eppstein94finding.html\">TR '94</a>,\n<a href=\"http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/eppstein98finding.html\">SJC '98</a> --\n<a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=299886\">ACM DL</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
