For further tips please come by lab and office hours.</p>\n  \n  <h2 id=\"hybrid-sort\">Hybrid sort</h2>\n  <p>You will be implementing a hybrid sorting algorithm based on merge sort and insertion sort. The way the hybrid algorithm works is by replacing the base case of the merge sort recursion. We define a constant K such that in the recursion when an array has length less than K the array is sorted using insertion sort. The rest of the merge sort algorithm remains unchanged. The value of K will need to be chosen through some experimentation. Try a value of K=100 to start.</p>\n  \n  <h2 id=\"your-task\">Your task</h2>\n  <p>Your task is to implement these three sorting algorithms: insertion sort, merge sort, hybrid sort. The starter code provides stubs for the sorting algorithms along with code that will run time trials on each algorithms. The stubs assume that the input data is given as a <strong>std::vector</strong>. The time trials use both random <strong>vectors</strong> and <strong>vectors</strong> that are close to being sorted.</p>\n  \n  <h3 id=\"rules\">Rules</h3>\n  <p>The only library that is off limits for this project is the <strong>&lt;algorithm&gt;</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <h3 id=\"starter-code\">Starter code</h3>\n  <p>Project 1 starter code: <a href=\"project1.tar.gz\">project1.tar.gz</a>  </p>\n  \n  <p>You can download this code at a terminal with the command:<br />\n  <strong>wget \u201chttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbannist/teaching/ics46/project1.tar.gz\u201d</strong></p>\n \n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "id": 2224.0}
