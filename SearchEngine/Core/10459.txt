{"text": "The News about Jon Reflections on the Wizard of TPs and other Network News By Rohit Khare October 19 1998 Aboard United 163 The last time I was flying into Los Angeles I was also facing a blank screen entitled Seventh Heaven Two months ago though I relied on a fellow passenger to help me frame the twenty five year design history of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP into a neat evolutionary tale its author Jon Postel I never quite got around to accepting his invitation to drop by ISI and set to documenting the further technical history of Internet protocol design Someday I thought the DNS Wars will be over a rechartered IANA born and all the time in the world or at least the interminable horizon of a doctoral program to listen to the old griot s tales of Transfer Protocols Well the founding articles for the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers were signed October 5th and the Wizard of TPs took off in his hot air balloon to domains unregistered forthwith Up here is about as close as you can get to cyberspace an indefinite feeling of being between places It s an appropriate place to meditate not just on Jon s life and good works but upon the very notion of grief for the loss of a man I arguably never knew Elsewhere in this issue you ll read testimonials from his friends and colleagues I am neither I am his student And so let me take a moment to survey his works To date this column has dissected Telnet FTP and SMTP all of which Jon edited himself along with TCP IP and ICMP to boot As we continue to reconstruct the evolution of application layer protocols such as this month s Network News Transfer Protocol NNTP we will move on to other designers work but always in Jon s shadow the theory of error reply codes the RFC style of documentation the careful identification of reliability and security risks the very gestalt of simplicity and interoperability can be traced to Jon as RFC Editor and Internet Architecture Board member His taste in design was by and large extraordinary And yet he did it in a way that you were only barely conscious that he was nudging you toward better design As the rest of the Internet unfolds we re going to discover that Jon isn t there to remind us what good taste means Vint Cerf Internet Society Chairman The Wizard of TPs While Jon was already on the UCLA programming team at the installation of IMP 1 and proceeded to document the ARPANET s low level protocols in the 7 s his role at the application layer bloomed during the changeover to TCP IP on January 1 1983 He took the lead in consciously reengineering several ARPANET services to work on the new Internet separating MTP from FTP 1 FTP from Telnet debugging services at the packet control message and upper layers STDs 5 1 2 26 and arranging gateways to translate back and forth to the new style of addressing Even so Table 1 omits further work on managing the transition see 771 773 and 8 1 That s not to say that Jon was done having cleaned the Big Three Augean stables His interest in formats ranging from a single byte 128 to structured digital audio 978 informed his foresight for multimedia mail 8 5 8 7 to a little known unified messaging architecture proposal 759 His design sense inspired other protocols some literally patterned on his precedent others through his influence on the process Why isn t there an Internet equivalent of Mach like interprocess communication by mailboxes and datagrams Jon did have one button you plain didn t want to push the one labeled reliable datagram Push it and you risk an immediate charge of heresy quoth Greg Finn a colleague of Jon s for two decades Sometimes the influence of man and institution are hopelessly intertwingled IANA is well known for its controversial role at the apex of domain name and network number registries but it is also responsible for a laundry list of other application parameters Many protocols extensibility strategies relied explicitly on Jon s good taste as gatekeeper for the options in Table 2 The Domain Name System then is the ultimate example of a technical artifact predicated on a Postel He took the lead in organizing a replacement for the centrally updated and manually distributed HOSTS TXT His colleague Paul Mockapetris protocol funnels trust upward to a set of high fidelity root servers coordinated by a presumably benign central authority Jon replied that starting a company to profit from his activities would have amounted to what he called a violation of public trust New York Times Building an Internet without Jon Santayana aside what s the virtue of dredging through sheaves of old RFCs Rather than repeat history or equivalently extrapolate linearly as with rumblings of scaled up Interplanetary IP we are liberated to invent a new network one that radically decentralizes control The application protocols we have today are distributed to be sure multiple actors reading from the same script enacting a single algorithm in many places A truly paranoid network though doesn t trust routing and naming subsystems blindly Today email messages are handed off in an adminstratively determined pathway represented in DNS MX records That s why mail to the user next door goes cross country three times up and down the corporate ladder Alternatively a hybrid mail news web message relay would discover its neighbors seal trust relationships and be introduced to colleagues relays to build a personal net without relying on a global grid It s a minor contribution to automate humans out of the loop for a billion Internet PCs but mandatory for trillions of cellular nanocomputers They may never swap IP packets but their engineering will owe as much to Jonathan Postel as to Boole Babbage and Hollerith He leaves a legacy of edited documents that tell our collective Internet story including not only the technical but also the poetic and whimsical as well 2468 as in Who do we appreciate I heard the news today oh boy I found out about Jon s passing a few hours before boarding from Dave Farber s Interesting People mailing list That same message was reforwarded back and forth across a half dozen lists I belong to over the next day tracing its propagation in my mailbox headers like a mighty oak s growth rings Why was the same message the same bag of bits burst out to so many readers one by one rather than broadcast once to entire networks The technology for flood fill delivery exists and I d like to discuss its origins how it works across the connected Internet and the increasingly separate fortunes of the institution and its protocol Netnews began as an outgrowth of multiuser systems banner announcements In late 1979 UNC replicated its newsgroups as shared Unix to Unix CoPy UUCP directories with Duke Originally targeted for 1 2 messages per day primarily bug reports USENET grew to over 1 sites and 25 articles per day within a year Salus Casting the Net p 135 How it works Since the user interface was based on Seventh Edition UNIX Mail its posting format followed suit roughly The earliest storage format See Table 3 used Title and Article ID headings an early transfer format even used positional syntax i e posts began with the letter A and the fifth line was assumed to be the Subject and so on By the time the first formal specification for USENET was mooted it could normatively define its behavior as extensions to the ARPA Internet Text Message Format See Table 4 Rather than listing email addresses in the To and Cc headings several Newsgroups indicated the topic addressed Upon detection of a new message article posting was an out of band operation as yet a server would notify each of its neighbors who were interested in at least one of those Newsgroups within the regions listed in Distribution and had not already seen it per the Path register to offer to transfer a copy Those commands however were multiplexed into the data stream Control messages looked like regular USENET traffic but were directed to other relays The commands in Table 5 are sent in Control headings or prefixed with cmsg in a Subject An entire day s traffic was typically batched up delimited length encoded or mailed enveloped as N prefixed lines to the sysadmin s map of neighbor relays Replacing UUCP with NNTP With the rise of the connected Internet though it made sense to separate command traffic onto an interactive channel to reduce duplicate traffic decrease latency and improve access for servers and newsreaders Brian Kantor UCSD and Phil Lapsley UCB merged control messages with the still novel experience of SMTP to create NNTP As today s NNTP Extensions Working Group reconstructed it NNTP was designed to do two things for the netnews computer conferencing system 1 Provide access to the netnews article database on a network server for reader client programs 2 Provide the means for interactive server to server article transfer over the Internet The trick is in NNTP s statefulness the conversation implictly maintains a current article pointer as new groups and articles are selected While it does have a mode for atomic access to messages a la SMTP MAIL or HTTP GET NNTP is designed for users and servers alike to browse an entire message store While modern implementations can partially pipeline some commands from Table 6 the spec s synchronous steps reveal its roots in an era where round trip times were proportional to transmission times By definitively adopting source quenching NNTP reduced reliance on complete graphs of USENET servers This correspondingly reduced the power of the backbone cabal since it was a snap to integrate several news feeds like adding the rebel alt hierarchy Note that creating or destroying groups or the 1984 innovation of moderation are technically straightforward steps their politics foreshadowed latter day dilemmas over new DNS top level domains and registration criteria In contrast the Internet Relay Chat specification 1459 spent considerable effort on policy guidelines for channel creation and admission The latest proposals for NNTP add a capability extensibility mechanism modeled on ESMTP s naming and registry model The WG is using that to promulgate standardized editions of vendor enhancements for searching and matching group names header contents and bodies as well as authentication and batch commands with lower latency e g OVER USENET s place in a Web Wise World The Imminent Death of USENET has been forecast almost since its birth for technical economic acceptable use and political reasons Better organized communities found homesteads on the Web instead evacuating their FAQs and expertise as the post 1994 spam barbarians crashed the gates Exponential growth in readership also weakened community bonds in favor of closed social mailing lists Massive USENET archives treading in to a copyright and privacy morass make it easier to dip in for a quick answer without ever subscribing to a community Finally newsreading tools haven t advanced as far as Web browser interfaces have MIME formatting even of text is still rare At the same time the ease of typing in news URLs has fragmented the notion of a single USENET Forums and Discussion Servers are lightly warmed over NNTP products but without any article exchange between hosts news islands And for intranet access within a secured set of known users Interactive Message Access Protocol IMAP public folders integrate even more cleanly with Mail tools further eclipsing News The Future of Broadcast Messaging Compared to our other push technology Mail News introduces the notion of a virtual recipient a distributed newsgroup Combined with distribution limits it made group messaging possible without enumerating the group in advance Rather than tracing the MX hierarchy its traffic flooded across a directed graph of peered News servers Once upon a time bandwidth was genuinely dear enough and interest widely shared enough for the community to support this alternative Today even with its dramatic per recipient connection overhead and error resolution bugs mailing lists are making a
