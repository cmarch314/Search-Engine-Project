Right now I m thinking something like plot exp lambda lambda r r where r is the vector that contains all the inter arrival times I assume these are supposed to be the k value from the equation However I m pretty sure this isn t good matlab coding Skynet 2 June 2 9 16 47 For 2 1 on homework 7 I m not sure how the plot is supposed to work What I ve done is make a histogram of timestamps and told matlab to hold the plot But my plot of the exponential distribution doesn t seem right Do the x values come straight from timestamps the differences between values in the time stamps or somewhere else I m just not sure where we re supposed to get the x in f x for the distribution Also what should be the domain on the graph for x The timestamps come from something like a Poisson process In a Poisson process what is exponentially distributed It s not the time stamps This is what you want to plot for part 1 Choose a domain that looks reasonable and enough bins to see the distribution s shape As you say use hold on to plot more than one thing together e g the histogram and a theoretical curve Pichu 23 May 2 9 2 36 Are we expected to solve PHI for normal distribution For example somehow code the integral from inf to x or can we assume that PHI is given back of book and use that So if we assume that we have PHI we can do the computation based around phi like x mew sigma without computing PHI Is that okay If we do have to code the integral how do we code inf in matlab Skynet 13 May 2 9 16 28 For 4 1 on homework 5 do we just report whatever frequencies MATLAB spits out for T 2 I m not quite sure what s meant by relative frequencies I m guessing that this question will have slightly different answers for each student since there isn t much room for convergence with only 2 iterations Relative frequency fraction of time out of T that the state took on each value For T 2 these will be multiples of 5 for example anonymous 13 May 2 9 14 25 Part 2 4 Are we also plotting p X t 2 on the same axis as in Part 2 3 Create a separate plot anonymous 12 May 2 9 15 4 Sorry the question was could convergence occur at time t 1 Possible but very unlikely to occur in practice anonymous 12 May 2 9 1 3 v initial state P state transition matrix pi v P Do we need to check the case of v pi epsilon No pi v P pi is the stationary distribution i e pi such that pi pi P In your homework you will try to compute pi using the power method by looking at v P t as t increases In class I called this quantity pi t the approximation to pi at time t It is also equal to p X t the marginal probability over states at time t given initial state distribution p X v You will check convergence of the power method by looking to see if these quantities are converging over time Pikachu 7 May 2 9 12 57 I think
