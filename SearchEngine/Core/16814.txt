Processor stall\ncan be used to increase the throughput by temporarily switching\nto a different thread of execution, or reduce the power\nand energy consumption by temporarily switching the processor\nto low-power mode. However, any such technique has\na performance overhead in terms of switching time. Even\nthough over the execution of an application the processor is\nstalled for a considerable amount of time, each stall duration\nis too small to profitably perform any state switch. In\nthis paper, we present code transformations to aggregate processor\nfree time. Our experiments on the Intel XScale and\nStream kernels show that up to 50,000 processor cycles can\nbe aggregated, and used to profitably switch the processor to\nlow-power mode. We further show that our code transformations\ncan switch the processor to low-power mode for up\nto 75% of kernel runtime, achieving up to 18% of processor\nenergy savings on multimedia applications. Our technique\nrequires minimal architectural modifications and incurs negligible\n(< 1%) performance loss.\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Center For Embedded Computer Systems,<br> \n      Department of Information and Computer Science,<br>\n      University of California, Irvine.\n      </td>\n    \n      <td valign=\"right\">\n      Strategic CAD Labs,<br>\n      Intel Corporation, <br>\n      Hudson, Massachussets.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "id": 16814.0}
