As the name implies, this system deals with objects that do not change in shape, as opposed to a system like nCloth that deforms the input mesh. You can think of Rigid Body Dynamics as a physics simulation that calculates how objects should react when they collide. This can be useful when you have too many objects to animate by hand. We will be using the Dynamics menu set for this project.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n<li class=\"step\">\r\n<p>\r\nYou will be using the following <a href=\"create_dominoes.mel\">script</a> to set up \r\na domino course. First, create a plane to serve as the ground.  Second, create a curve using the CV Curve Tool to lay out the path of your dominoes. Paste the script into \r\nyour Script Editor (<strong>Window &rarr; General Editors &rarr; Script Editor</strong>) and with the curve selected do <strong>Command \r\n&rarr; Execute</strong>. This will create a set of dominoes with the first one already falling over.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li class=\"step\">\r\n<p>\r\nThe next step is to make the objects in your scene dynamic.  Select the ground plane and go to <strong>Soft/Rigid Bodies &rarr; Create Passive Rigid Body</strong> to\r\nmake it a collidable, non-moving dynamic object.  Select the each domino (individually, NOT the group!) and go to <strong>Soft/Rigid Bodies &rarr; Create Active Rigid Body</strong> to make them \"active\" dynamic objects, which can both collide\r\nwith other dynamic objects and respond to force fields.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo simulate gravity, select each domino, then create a new gravity field by going to <strong>Fields &rarr; Gravity</strong>.  \r\nThe dominos should be automatically linked to the gravity field. If you ever need to add more objects to the scene, you will \r\nhave to manually link them to existing fields by selecting both and navigating to <strong>Fields &rarr; Affect Selected Object(s)</strong>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHit play and watch the dominoes fall down.  Make sure the timeline is set to play every frame.\r\nYou can cache the results by going to <strong>Solvers &rarr; Memory Caching &rarr; Enable</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(IMPORTANT: Do <b><i>not</i></b> duplicate dominoes that are already rigid bodies, as duplicated rigid body nodes will not work.  Set up all of your dominoes first, <i>then</i> make them rigid bodies.)\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li class=\"step\">\r\n<p>\r\nEventually you are going to want more control over the motion of your dynamic objects. A rigid body simulation is a good \r\nstarting point, but there will be a lot of motion you will need to clean up. To do this, you can convert your dynamics into \r\na set of key frames by going to <strong>Edit &rarr; Keys &rarr; Bake Simulation (Options)</strong>. You will want to specify \r\nhow many frames you want to bake out. Once you are finished tweaking your dominoes, turn in a playblast of them falling down.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"small\" src=\"images/up.jpg\" />\r\n<img class=\"small\" src=\"images/down.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\n<legend><strong>Turn In</strong></legend>\r\nYou will be graded on the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Following instructions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nTurn in the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Playblast (sequence of images) of your dominos in action, saved in a directory named <b> yourname_animation_dominos</b>. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 26270.0}
