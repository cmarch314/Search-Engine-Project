Such problems\ncan be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.\nWe show that if d,\nthe number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant\ngreater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but\nadmits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary\ninteger, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem\nwith any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem\nis polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity\nfor variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection\nproblems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs\nof distributions.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/bibs/eppstein.html#The minimum expectation selection problem\">BibTeX</a> --\n<a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=772620\">ACM DL</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>On the approximability of geometric and geographic generalization\nand the min-max bin covering problem</b>.<br>\nW.

An input to this problem consists\nof a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must\nbe grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at\nleast the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/anonymity.ppt\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"auth.html\">Co-authors</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
