An overall score in   the course will be calculated using the following weighting:\r\n              <UL>\r\n              <LI>Problem Sets (10%)\r\n              <LI>Midterm (35%)                  \r\n              <LI>Final (55%)   \r\n                  </UL>\r\n              <p>No absolute scale will be used in assigning letter grades to each overall   score.

The instructor reserves the right   to override this policy in individual cases where the student has demonstrated   mastery of the material on the final, but this is rare.</p>\r\n              <p>All grades (problem sets, midterm, final, and the final course letter grade) will be   available through eee.uci.edu.</p>\r\n              <H4><U>Course Text:</U></H4>\r\n              <UL>\r\n                  <LI><em><strong>Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet</strong></em><strong>,   James Kurose &amp; Keith Ross, Addison-Wesley. </strong>(<A href=\"http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Computer-Networking-A-TopDown-Approach-6E/9780132856201.page\">publisher</A>, <A href=\"http://antpac.lib.uci.edu/search?/aKurose%2C+James+F/akurose+james+f/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&FF=akurose+james+f&1%2C%2C4\">UCI   reserve</A>)<strong> [<a href=\"book.html\">Instructions on purchasing the book</a>]</strong></LI>\r\n              </UL>\r\n              <p><STRONG><U>Reference Texts:</U></STRONG>\r\n                <UL>\r\n                  <LI><em><a href=\"http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_kurose_compnetw_6/216/55463/14198700.cw/index.html\">Interactive applet</a><a href=\"http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive/\">s, Interactive Exercises, and Powerpoint Slides </a> from <em>Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet</em>,   James Kurose &amp; Keith Ross, Addison-Wesley.</em>\r\n                  <LI><em>Computer Networks</em>, Andrew Tanenbaum and David Wetherall, Prentice Hall.
