Moishe How clever to try all those email addresses and succeed in getting through to me I have had a look at your website and I was extremely impressed My only information on Langsam comes from the family tree put together by Susan Wynne et al But while it is very broad reaching I found yours easier to follow obviously because of its narrowness but also because there is more detail For the first time I was able easily to go straight back to Pesach through Chaim Lieb My grandmother was Cila Raff her mother was Ethel Fish Ethels father was Mendel Fish who was Miriam Langsam s son My grandmother had a number of siblings Some of whom are in the Fish and the Langsam Spira family tree However her father married twice and there were other siblings from the second marriage whose names we do not know Cila had a brother who ended up in the USA His name mayhave been Martin Raff This is all very exciting and I shall keep watching your pages for more developments Incidentally despite my Irish name I am a sabra born in Haifa in 1943 but lived most of my life in Australia I am writing a novel at the moment and part of it is set in the forests of easter Poland during World War II As you probably know there were a number of Jewish partisan camps and if you know of anybody who would help me with experiences of this time and place I would be extremely grateful Kind regards Eileen Naseby

January 4 2 12 33 AM Thanks for this Moishe My info at this stage has been the Langsam family tree I went to Poland in October a long way from Sydney and visited Dynov where my grandmother was born The Jewish cemetries were of course empty of headstones Yet it was a very moving experience I intend to go back to do some further research so maybe I will come up with further information when I have more time I am writing a novel which is totally fiction but the characters are loosely based on my mother and grandmother So because the novel research was my main purpose in going to Poland and then to Jerusalem I had little time for things of a genealogical nature According to yours and Susanne s family tree the following is my lineage Pesach Langsam Chaim Leib Miriam Langsam Mendel Fish Ethel Fish Hirsch Raff Cila Raff Solomon Singer Ursula Singer Anthony Piercy Eileen Piercy David Naseby Nigel and Toby Naseby My mother Ursula s second marriage to Nigel Hall produced five children Diana

Prsymersyl excuse spelling too lazy to look it up Eileen told me that good old Hersh RAFF was married twice but knows nothing of the first marriage I made contact with my dad s first cousin a couple of year s ago In our phone conversation he mentioned that my grandfather had told him that the RAFFs were once known as FISH FISCH The story made no sense and I decided the whole thing was pretty fishy I than chanced on this Ethel FISH RAFF and the story seemed to have more credence I now think that maybe this Abraham RAFF not my grandfather told the cousin that story I guess it turned out to be true but I don t think for my branch of the family My RAFFs were associated with the SICHERMAN name According to Eilenn Naseby of Australia at eileen filmworld com au many of her relatives were watchmakers also She has a Bukowsko connection so I figured there must be a relationship of some type I didn t see her family tree until I met her in L A Her RAFF branch seems to have made a pitstop in Israel before immigrating to Australia She was born in Palestine So it looks like you have a new email address to add Eileen is a real interesting person She was to have completed her first novel in January which is loosely based on her grandmother She was not brought up in a religious home and her sister and her mom seem to have become members of the Bahai faith I don t know if she has ever been in a synagogue She owns a film company which rents historical video footage to film productions etc Debbie A watched clock never boils Original Message From moishe langsam com To Debbie Raff Date Monday January 17 2 8 58 AM Subject Re The Importance of the JewishGen Family Finder Hi Actually your note made perfect sense Don t be fooled by my website there are plenty of holes anyhow In fact if you look through you will see that I had a g g g uncle from Bukowsko named Shabsi Yitzchok Miller 183 s 1894 who had ten kids Getting back to your Australian RAFF related to Langsam do you have an email ID for her From Suzan s book I am guessing this cousin is from Ethel Hirsch RAFF Do you know of any other Langsam s Good Luck Moishe moishe langsam com www langsam com At 6 56 PM 1 16 8 you wrote Unfortunately I am not related to the LANGSAM family although I met with an Australian RAFF who is related to the LANGSAM family through the surname FISH We had been corresponding and it turned out that she stopped in L A for 2 days on her way to the U K and eventually Poland She took out her family tree pages which may have been compiled by Suzan Wynne We finally realized that my grandfather s 1st cousin who I knew as Uncle Abe in NY appeared to be her grandmother s brother who went off to America The name of the missing brother seemed to be lost to history at their end yet my Uncle Abe s father and her grandmother s father both had the same first name I am following me but I don t know that this actually makes any sense to the outside world I have run across your website before and only wish my family tree were as complete Although my surname is RAFF and I always felt that it was because we had a Rabbi in the family I have not been able to locate that Rabbi yet In reality my grandfather came from the small town of Bukowsko which is near Sanok I also found my surname in the Sanok Yizkor book related to the surname SCHNEEBAUM I believe But have gotten nowhere going down that path Debbie RAFF California where it rained today Original Message From moishe langsam com To Debbie Raff Date Sunday January 16 2 6 39 PM Subject Re The Importance of the JewishGen Family Finder Hi Since you mention your own connection to Sanok I was wondering if any of your OWN family had a connection to the Langsam They had a large presence in that basic geographical area Moishe Miller moishe langsam com www langsam com At 11 47 AM 1 16 8 you wrote Yesterday I found myself checking entries for the JewishGen Family Finder for the town of Sanok Although not a plan I began emailing people who had a surname listed in the index of the Polish book I have on the history of Sanok This is not the Yizkor book In fact had this actually have been well thought out I would have sat in a more comfortable chair grin Anyway I woke up this morning to 2 requests to search this book for surnames Not a problem but since both of these people had surnames in the book theoretically I should have emailed them with the information yesterday In fact if everyone has listed and updated their information I should be getting no more requests Either these people are listed on the JGFF without an email address or they have not listed these surnames with JGFF In a sense they have become the missing link So if you have inherited some new surnames recently and haven t gotten around to updating the info or are new to genealogy please take the time to input your information into the Family Finder at After all there may be another researcher out there who is a glutton for punishment vbg like me who would have contacted you but your bit of information did not exist and you may never connect Debbie Raff California Family from or nearby Lviv Let JewishGen
