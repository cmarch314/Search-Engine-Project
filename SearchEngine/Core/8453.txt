Traditional dynamic \r\nprogramming techniques are ine\u000ecient for solving factored MDPs whose \r\nstate and action spaces are exponential in the number of the state and action variables, correspondingly. We focus on exploiting problems'\r\nstructure imposed by variable independence that implies decomposability of transitional probabilities, rewards, and policies, and is captured by theinteraction graph of an MDP, obtained from its in uence diagram.\r\nUsing the framework of bucket elimination[9], we formulate a variable elimination algorithm elim-meu-id for computing maximum expected utility, given an inuence diagram, and apply it to MDPs. Traditional\r\ndynamic programming techniques for solving finite and infinite-horizon MDPs, such asbackward induction, value iteration, andpolicy iteration, can be also\r\nviewed as bucket elimination algorithms applied to a particular ordering of the state and decision variables. The time and space complexity of elimination algorithms is <i>O(exp(w<sub>o</sub><sup>*</sup>))</i>, where <i>w<sub>o</sub><sup>*</sup></i> the induced width of\r\nthe interaction graph along the ordering o of its nodes.\r\nUnifying framework of bucket elimination makes complexity analysis and variable ordering heuristics developed in constraint-based and probabilistic reasoning\r\napplicable to decision-theoretic planning. As we show,\r\nselecting \"good\" orderings improves the efficiency of traditional MDP algorithms.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r42.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r42.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8453.0}
