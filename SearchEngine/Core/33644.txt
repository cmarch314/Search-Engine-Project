{"text": "Jim Whitehead Research and Papers Jim has been performing research as a Ph D student in Information and Computer Science at the University of California Irvine as part of the Arcadia consortium Jim s research lies in five areas Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web Versioning and Configuration Management of Hypermedia Open Hypermedia Systems Software Architecture Software Development Environments Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web The World Wide Web was originally conceived as an interactive read write medium and it is only the early dominance of the Mosaic browser which cast the Web into its current publish browse paradigm While the HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP 1 1 contains limited support for remote authoring in addition to remote browsing of content this support is not sufficient for collaborative authoring of web content Jim is the Chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning WEBDAV Working Group which is developing interoperability specifications for how to perform remote authoring and versioning of web content The distributed authoring and versioning working group has held many meetings For a complete list of meetings their minutes and presentations given at the meetings consult the WebDAV Home Page Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol for the

Management of Hypermedia The promise that hypermedia technology holds for allowing software developers to capture the relationships between the software documents they produce requirements design source code test cases etc and easily browse through their project information space will only be realized once hypermedia systems can support versioned links among versioned artifacts which can be meaningfully grouped into configurations Providing this support has been the goal of Jim s research into versioning and configuration management of hypermedia Jim was a participant in the first Workshop on Versioning in Hypertext Systems held at ECHT 94 where he presented a proposal for adding versioning support to the Chimera open hypermedia system He was also a member of the panel Things Change Deal with It Versioning Cooperative Editing and Hypertext at Hypertext 96 Jim additionally discussed issues of hypertext versioning and configuration management as a participant at the Sixth International Workshop on Software Configuration Management held before the 18th International Conference on Software Engineering ICSE18 held March 25 26 1996 in Berlin Germany Versioning and configuration management are important issues for the World Wide Web To ensure the future web provides good support in this area in May 1996 Jim gathered representatives from software configuration management firms document management companies WWW researchers hypertext versioning researchers and HTTP server authors together to form the Working Group on Versioning and Configuration Management of World Wide Web Content This group was subsumed by the Working Group on Distributed Authoring and Versioning on the World Wide Web webdav in early September 1996 The topic of managing WWW content was the subject of a talk which Jim along with Martin Cagan then at Continuus Software now at Netscape gave at the symposium Wired The Internet and the World Wide Web May 1996 sponsored by the Irvine Research Unit in Software IRUS titled WWW Content Management Emerging Problems Emerging Solutions This talk was also presented at the Bay Area Roundtable BART in May 1996 A Proposal for Versioning

system Chimera provides hypermedia infrastructure for use within a software development environment Due to its openness Chimera can provide hypermedia functionality within existing tools such as vi FrameMaker an MPEG player etc Jim s research on the Chimera project has focused on these client application integrations with the Chimera system As a thought experiment Jim also considered an
