The concepts of induced width and\r\ndiversity are shown to play a key role in bounding the complexity of the procedure.\r\nThe importance of our analysis lies in highlighting structure-based tractable classes of\r\nsatisfiability and in providing theoretical guarantees on the time and space complexity\r\nof the algorithm. Contrary to previous assessments, we show that for many theories\r\ndirectional resolution could be an effective procedure. Our empirical tests confirm\r\ntheoretical prediction, showing that on problems with a special structure, namely k-tree\r\nembeddings (e.g. chains, (k,m)-trees), directional resolution greatly outperforms one of\r\nthe most effective satisfiability algorithms known to date, the popular Davis-Putnam\r\nprocedure. Furthermore, combining a bounded version of directional resolution with\r\nthe Davis-Putnam procedure results in an algorithm superior to either components.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"R29a.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"R29a.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8501.0}
