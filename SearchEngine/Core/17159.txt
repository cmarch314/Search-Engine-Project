However, performance evaluation\nof partial bypassing in processors has been inaccurate,\nlargely due to the absence of bypass-sensitive retargetable\ncompilation techniques. Furthermore no existing\npartial bypass exploration framework estimates the power\nand cost overhead of partial bypassing. In this paper we\npresent PBExplore: A framework for Compiler-in-the-Loop\nexploration of partial bypassing in processors. PBExplore\naccurately evaluates the performance of a partially bypassed\nprocessor using a generic bypass-sensitive compilation\ntechnique. It synthesizes the bypass control logic and\nestimates the area and energy overhead of each bypass configuration.\nPBExplore is thus able to effectively perform\nmulti-dimensional exploration of the partial bypass design\nspace. We present experimental results on the Intel XScale\narchitecture on MiBench benchmarks and demonstrate the\nneed, utility and exploration capabilities of PBExplore.\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Center For Embedded Computer Systems,<br> \n      Department of Information and Computer Science,<br>\n      University of California, Irvine.\n      </td>\n    \n      <td valign=\"right\">\n      Strategic CAD Labs,<br>\n      Intel Corporation, <br>\n      Hudson, Massachussets.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "id": 17159.0}
