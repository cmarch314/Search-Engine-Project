21st Int Symp Graph Drawing Bordeaux France 2 13 Lecture Notes in Comp Sci 8242 2 13 pp 352 363 A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by smooth paths in the drawing We define a variant of confluent drawing strict confluent drawing in which a smooth path between two vertices if it exists must be unique We show that it is NP complete to test whether such drawings exist in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open Additionally we show that finding outerplanar drawings in which the points are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it with a fixed cyclic vertex ordering
