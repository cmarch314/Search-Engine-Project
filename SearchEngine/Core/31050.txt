However, if we have set of photos from the same event,\n we can leverage on other context data like clothing to disambiguate between faces of people. People tend to wear the same clothes throughout a day event\n (party/ trip). By virtue of their colors and texture, clothes have a lot of distinguishing power. Thus in an event where there are 10 different participants, number of people wearing red colored clothing will \ntypically be much smaller. Given this smaller set of people, it may be easy to cluster same the faces from the same person.
