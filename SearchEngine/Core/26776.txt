Lead Program Manager Microsoft Corporation alexhop microsoft com In the last few years the World Wide Web has enabled the world s first large scale globally accessible corpus of information What makes this especially amazing is that it has done so without any standardized system for document management and authoring The IETF Internet Engineering Task Force WebDAV Working group has set out to define standards for Distributed Authoring and Versioning based on HTTP with the goal of providing a Standards based framework for authoring collaborating and managing the Web The base WebDAV specification is nearing completion This talk will address the basic architecture of both the WebDAV protocol as well as the newer Distributed Searching and Locating protocol including a detailed discussion of how these standards work The talk will then explain how this architecture can be used to enable common document authoring scenarios as well as more sophisticated web based applications using XML Biography Alex Hopmann is a Lead Program Manager for the Microsoft Corporation where he is the liason between product development and standards development Alex has been a key participant of several IETF working groups and is currently the chair of a follow on group to WebDAV the Distributed Authoring Searching and Locating DASL group He founded ResNova Software in 199 to develop collaborative online applications leading him into involvement with the IETF standards process where he has helped design aspects of HTTP 1 1 WebDAV and is co author of the MHTML HTML Email standard Like many of today s

Web Publishing and Text Search Group Netscape Communications Corp jfc netscape com Scaling document management on the Internet is becoming an important area as information of all types is quickly being moved to Web based access The amount of data available and the number of users generating this data on the web is growing rapidly as is the number of users who are accessing this data In addition some data may be dynamically generated Scaling document management solutions to handle this problem is going to be necessary to ensure the data is accurate does not become stale and can be managed by a large community of users who are managing documents which may be distributed across the Internet This talk will define some of the issues regarding scaling on the Internet suggest some ideas for managing this scaling problem and provide some real world feedback based on Internet experience with the Netscape Enterprise Server Web Publishing and Search systems Biography Jim Cunningham is the Engineering Manager of the Web Publishing and Text Search group at Netscape Communications Corp where he oversees the development of web based document management features of the Netscape
