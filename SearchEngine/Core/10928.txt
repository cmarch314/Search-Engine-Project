hard to generate the desired polytope for large n preserving both the sought polytope s planarity of faces and the polygon s linearity of diagonals after projection I arrived at this question when I

already found a solution here is mine firstly inductively then non inductively Suppose you have for an existing polygonal region P a function f giving the height at each point being equal to on dP the boundary of P and continuous and affine on the polygonal subregions in question Add another vertex v making a polygon Q Define g on Q to be that whose graph is a pyramid with base Q and apex v e g if x in Q V there is a unique lambda in 1 and y in dP intersect dQ such that x lambda v 1 lambda y Define g x lambda Then g f is as required except on Q P But this is easy to fix as the diagonals passing through Q P divide it into triangles with a vertex at v e g define h to have graph equal to the top surface of the convex hull of graph g f P union Q x OR define it as some lambda in a convex combination as above Come to think of it this construction can be done in closed form Read a b as a subscript b here Let P be the polygon and V the finite vertex set For each v in V define g v on P by
