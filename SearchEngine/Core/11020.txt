geometry vision Date 14 Jan 92 17 53 16 GMT Organization State University of New York at Buffalo Comp Sci Topologists have written a number of papers concerned with this notion namely describing a metric in which closeness implies not only closeness with respect to the Hausdorff metric but also resemblance of figures with respect to some topological or geometric property Unfortunately from the standpoint of computer science most are unsatisfactory for the following reasons a Most of the interesting results obtained by topologists for these metrics are along the lines of Suppose two figures A and B are sufficiently close in such a metric Then they have in common the following properties where the properties in question are often not of interest to computational geometers b Most of the metrics described by the topology papers written for this purpose at least those papers I ve read are difficult or impractical to compute I have a paper soon to appear in Pattern Recognition Letters in which I describe several metrics in which closeness of two polygons A and B implies that A and B are close with respect to the Hausdorff metric and that they have similar deviations from convexity The results aren t real deep nor are they always satisfying from the standpoint of the goal of describing a metric that is efficiently computable and in which closeness would imply similar geometry but the paper is a start in the direction of developing efficiently computable metrics that are stronger than the Hausdorff metric with respect to measuring how well one figure approximates another geometrically as well as positionally The paper of Stern cited below is another such attempt Below are some references on metrics Hausdorff and beyond Some are topology references that may be useful to computational geometers only from the standpoint of originating the suggestion of adding another comparison of two figures to their Hausdorff distance in order to obtain a stronger metric Others

article 16 3 junon thomson lcr fr juliette thomson lcr fr Juliette Mattioli writes I am looking for distances between sets or compact sets of R n The question is How can I characterize that two compact sets are shape close Looks like you could use a dilatation operator on your set and then use Haussdorff By the way how do you define shape If it has some relationship with measure then if your sets are given by union of some sets get first rid of the null measure sets I would use the first method There is a metric used in image processing which does about what you want but I do not remember the name sorry it is not my field I just used to do maths with some of these guys It definitely had something to do with dilatation You re thinking of mathematical morphology the image processing area that uses dilation The Hausdorff metric has been called the basis of mathematical morphology for whatever that s worth As the original post hinted the Hausdorff metric is sensitive to outlying points in a shape The so called template metric the other one mentioned in the original post d x y area x y area y x where x and y are shapes ignores outliers and the construction of the Minkowski sum of a shape and a small ball i e dilation is not continuous in this metric The issue of what is a shape is of course important but we in the image processing world try to ignore such details when possible I realize that s not appropriate here In general the natural domain of the Hausdorff metric is the set of compact shapes and the natural domain of the template metric is the space of measurable subsets As noted we can ignore sets of measure zero for the template metric but not for the Hausdorff metric But there are many other ways to define metrics between shapes One I use in my work is the transport or Monge Kantorovich metric For S 1 S 2 subsets of the real plane d S 1 S 2 inf int S 1 int S 2 abs x 1 x 2 dp x 1 x 2 where the inf is taken over all probability measures p on S 1 x S 2 with fixed marginals int S 1 int U 2 dp x 1 x 2 area U 2 area S 2 int U 1 int S 2 dp x 1 x 2 area U 1 area S 1 Think of this as the amount of work required to rearrange the pieces of shape S 1 into the shape of S 2 The transport metric is a good combination of the template and Hausdorff metrics in practice since it gives equal weight to all points of a shape Its natural domain is the space of probability measures if we assign a measure p S U area S cap U area S to each shape S In this way we can also discuss fuzzy shapes where membership in a shape near a boundary is not a binary decision The transport metric can be quickly calculated with linear programming Another popular metric in image processing now has been studied at Brown the optimal diffeomorphism metric d S 1 S 2 inf int S 1 Jp 2 int S 2 J p 1 2 where the inf is taken over all one to one onto differentiable maps p S 1 S 2 with inverse p 1 and J is its Jacobian The main problem with this metric is that two shapes identical except for an infinitesimal tear will be infinitely far apart because they are not topologically equivalent and admit no diffeomorphisms There have been extensions and changes to this metric to deal with these situations Note that the question of what metric to use to find a distance between shapes is very dependent on what you re trying to do I think the transport metric gives answers that are fairly close to what humans would give but if you re trying to find a hairline crack defect in a machine tool that s not a very good solution So consider your needs while you re considering your

The transport metric is a good\ncombination of the template and Hausdorff metrics in practice, since\nit gives equal weight to all points of a shape.  Its natural domain is\nthe space of probability measures, if we assign a measure\n\tp_S (U) = area(S \\cap U) / area(S)\nto each shape S.  In this way we can also discuss \"fuzzy shapes,\"\nwhere membership in a shape near a boundary is not a binary\ndecision.\n\tThe transport metric can be quickly calculated with linear\nprogramming.\n\nAnother popular metric in image processing now has been studied at\nBrown: the optimal diffeomorphism metric d(S_1,S_2) = \n\tinf { int_{S_1} |Jp|^2 + int_{S_2} |J(p^{-1})|^2 },\nwhere the inf is taken over all one-to-one, onto differentiable\nmaps p:S_1 -&gt; S_2 with inverse p^{-1}, and J is its Jacobian.\nThe main problem with this metric is that two shapes identical except\nfor an infinitesimal tear will be infinitely far apart because they\nare not topologically equivalent and admit no diffeomorphisms.\nThere have been extensions and changes to this metric to deal with \nthese situations.\n\nNote that the question of \"what metric to use to find a distance\nbetween shapes\" is very dependent on what you're trying to do.
