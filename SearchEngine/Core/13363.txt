segments in the plane in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated log factor then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear time It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated log factor so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the size of the graph On the approximability of geometric and geographic generalization and the min max bin covering problem W Du D Eppstein M T Goodrich G Lueker arXiv

show that under several models of how the query answers are returned the database can be copied in a linear or near linear number of queries Our method for the competitor to copy the database is based on simulating Fortune s sweep line algorithm for Voronoi diagrams backtracking when the simulation discovers the existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi diagram

the root with the edges at each node spaced equally around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular resolution If we are allowed to permute the children of each node then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length However if the child ordering is prescribed exponential area might be necessary We show that if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the edges as circular arcs a style we call Lombardi drawing then even with a prescribed child ordering we can achieve polynomial area Extended dynamic subgraph statistics using h index parameterized data structures D Eppstein M T Goodrich D Strash and L Trott Proc 4th Int Conf

networks in which participants know categorical information about some other participants and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors that have more categories in common with the eventual destination We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum number of categories that any individual belongs to a natural measure of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small world phenomenon a social network can be given a category system with polylogarithmic
