Stop the evaluation.</li>\n\t<li>Correctness: does the program produce the correct output for Pride and Prejudice? [<A href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/master/test/pride-and-prejudice.txt\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/master/test/pride-and-prejudice.txt</A>] <i>(40 points)</i>.</li>\n\t<li>Form: is it only one source file? <i>(10 points)</i></li>\n\t<li>Operation:\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Does it run from the command line? <i>(20 points)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Does it take a file name as argument? <i>(10 points)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Does it read the file of stop words from the parent directory (../stop_words.txt)? <i>(10 points)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Is the code written following good programming practices (descriptive names, short methods, proper use of the language)? <i>(10 points)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Has the file been modified after Sunday noon?

(Although, we will normalize the score later on to adjust it with the readings and peer grading)</p>\n\n<p>Some rules regarding programming practices for us to be as happy as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Using variable or function/method names such as \"a\", \"b\", \"x\", \"z\", \"w\" is not good. We have big screens and can afford longer and descriptive names for variables, functions and classes. <b>Please, keep in mind that using single-letter names is not prohibited (it's OK if you use them to name an index [for i] or a lambda parameter) but you shouldn't use them for identifiers that are relevant to your algorithms (for example, if you put a list of words in a List structure, don't name it \"l\", use something more appropriate like \"words\", \"listOfWords\", \"wordList\" or something like that). I hope you get the point here. </b> <i>(up to 5 points penalty)</i></li>\n\t<li>Inappropriate data structures: we mean inefficient, or less than optimal, for the constraints (or lack of thereof) at hand. For example, if there are no special constraints on the use of data structures, lists are inappropriate for storing a large number of items that need to be searched. <i>(up to 5 points penalty)</i></li>\n\t<li>You can't deduct points only because the code is not formatted as you would like. Some people put curly brackets at the end of the sentence, others in the next line. Either way is OK.</li>\n\t<li>You can't deduct points just because \"you would have done it differently\", unless the way the student did it is wrong.</li>\n\t<li>Feedback is highly welcome but, please, be constructive. We all do our best to complete the assignments, and learning is the paramount goal.</li>\n\t<li>It's OK highlighting stuff even if you aren't deducting points for it. If you think there's a better way to do something and want to let the student know but without taking points off, that's completely fine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will need to adhere to this rubric as much as possible to minimize the difference among peer-graders.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2186.0}
