{"text": "CS 167 Cryptography Homework 1 5 Points Due Friday January 18 2 8 What is the ciphertext for ATTACKATDAWN using a shift cipher with shift key k 5 ROT13 is a simple shift cipher for English text such that when it is applied twice it returns the original plaintext Argue why there is no single shift cipher for English text such that when it is applied three times it returns the original plaintext Give an example of a simple shift cipher for English other than ROT13 such that when it is applied some number m 26 times it returns the original plaintext What is the value of m in this case The 4th century Indian text Kama Sutra proposes among other things a method for secret writing where each letter is paired with another and each occurrence of a letter in a document is replaced by its mate For example we could pair A V B N C E D F E C F D and so on so that every A is replaced by V and every V is replaced by A every B is replaced by N and every N is replaced by B etc Give an example encryption using a Kama Sutra cipher How many possible keys are there for the Kama Sutra cipher What is the security of the Kama Sutra cipher with respect to the four kinds of attacks that can be done on a cryptosystem Suppose Eve has learned that Bob is using an Affine cipher and she has been able to apply a known plaintext attack to learn that the plaintext ADOG has FLHR as its ciphertext What is Bob s key Suppose Eve has learned that Bob is using a Vigenere cipher with keyword length m 12 and she has been able to apply a chosen plaintext attack to learn that the plaintext AAAAAAAA has BCDEBCDE as its ciphertext What are the possible values for m ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/cs167/hw/hw1.html", "title": "cs 167 - cryptography homework 1", "html": "<html>\n\n<head>\n<title>CS 167 - Cryptography Homework 1</title>\n</head>\n\n<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n\n<center>\n\n<h2>CS 167 - Cryptography Homework 1, 50 Points\n<br>\nDue: Friday, January 18, 2008</h2>\n\n</center>\n\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nWhat is the ciphertext for ATTACKATDAWN using a shift cipher with shift key\n<i>k</i>=5?\n<li>\n   ROT13 is a simple shift cipher\n   for English text such that when it is applied twice\n   it returns the original plaintext.\n   Argue why there is no single\n   shift cipher for English text such that when it is applied three times\n   it returns the original plaintext.\n   Give an example of a simple shift cipher for English other than\n   ROT13 such that\n   when it is applied some number\n   <i>m</i> < 26 times it returns the original plaintext.\n   What is the value of <i>m</i> in this case?\n<li>\n  The 4th century Indian text, <i>Kama Sutra</i>,\n  proposes, among other things,\n  a method for secret writing where each letter is paired with\n  another and each occurrence of a letter in\n  a document is replaced by its mate. \n  For example, we could pair (A,V), (B,N), (C,E), (D,F), (E,C), (F,D), \nand so on, so that \nevery \"A\" is replaced by \"V\" and every \"V\" is replaced by \"A\", \nevery \"B\" is replaced by \"N\" and every \"N\" is replaced by \"B\", \netc.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>\nGive an example encryption using a Kama Sutra cipher.\n<li>\nHow many possible keys are there for the Kama Sutra cipher?\n<li>\nWhat is the security of the Kama Sutra cipher with respect to the four\nkinds of attacks that can be done on a cryptosystem?\n</ol>\n\n<li>\nSuppose Eve has learned that Bob is using an Affine cipher,\n  and she has been able to apply\n  a known-plaintext attack to learn that the plaintext\n  ``ADOG'' has ``FLHR'' as its ciphertext.
