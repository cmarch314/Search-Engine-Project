the intersection of computer science and information technology with biology and medicine Students will receive a firm quantitative grounding in mathematics statistics and computation become familiar with the basic foundations of physics chemistry and biology master a rigorous and demanding Biomedical Computing year long sequence study theory algorithms data mining and machine learning and carry out a year long immersive capstone Senior Project The immense growth and impact of biomedical information has led to a critical need for people who can understand the languages tools and techniques of both life sciences and computational sciences The Biomedical Computing program aims to create a new generation of professionals with these complementary cross disciplinary skills Is Biomedical Computing for me What do I take What can I do with this degree Biomedical Computing Minor Special Programs and Learning Opportunities Still not sure Is BMC for me The degree program in Biomedical Computing will provide students with a solid foundation in computer science quantitative methods and biomedical computing introduce students to biomedical computing problems and the corresponding computer science perspective teach students the fundamental principles methods and technologies for addressing these problems andprovide students with extensive practice in biomedical computing In the lower division program students acquire a firm quantitative grounding in mathematics statistics and computation become familiar with the basic foundations of physics and chemistry and learn the fundamentals of molecular biology from a computational perspective In the upper division program students take a year long Biomedical Computing sequence study theory algorithms data mining and machine learning and take several quantitative and biological electives The year long immersive capstone Senior Project unifies theory and practice as applied to an intensive and meaningful real world biomedical computing problem By the end of the four year degree program students will have mastered the theory context application and practice of Biomedical Computing NOTE The major in Biomedical Computing may not be combined with the minor in Information and Computer Science Back to top What do I take Major Requirements Lower division ICS 21 ICS 22 ICS 23 ICS 51 and ICS 52 Mathematics 2A B

requirements will be able to Synthesize computer science quantitative methods and biological science Understand the synergistic set of reciprocal influences between life and computational sciences and technologies Discuss biomedical computing problems and corresponding computer science perspectives Employ principles methods and technologies fundamental to biomedical computing Design and develop software that solves biomedical computing problems Graduates have considerable opportunities in the employment sector The combined healthcare and biomedical industry is the nation s largest industrial sector and computational methods increasingly play a driving role For example in the fast paced pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries the highest projected recruiting demand is for medical biological and computer research personnel Students also would flow easily into many different graduate degree programs Back to top Biomedical Computing Minor Students may also pursue a minor in Biomedical Computing The minor provides a focused study of biomedical computing to supplement a student s major program of study and prepares students for a profession career or academic pursuit in which biomedical computing is an integral part but is not the primary focus The Biomedical Computing minor contributes to students competence in computing applied to biomedical problems and data as well as exposing them to the fundamentals of the life sciences from a computer science perspective The minor allows students sufficient flexibility to pursue courses that complement their major field or address specific interests Students who complete the minor requirements will be able to Synthesize computer science quantitative methods and biological science Understand the synergistic set of reciprocal influences between life and computational sciences and technologies Discuss biomedical computing problems and corresponding computer science perspectives Employ principles methods and technologies fundamental to biomedical computing REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR IN BIOMEDICAL COMPUTING Lower division ICS 21 ICS 22 ICS 23 Biological Sciences 93 94 and 9C Upper division CS 183 Bio Sci M123 CS 184A CS 184B and CS 184C Back to top Special Programs and Learning Opportunities There are several ways to add depth scope and experiential learning to your academic program of study An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major minor or concentration to your academic plan and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals CONCENTRATIONS Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus followed by a technology related internship in the host country Application Each student s proposed program of study specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U S must be approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student Affairs It is expected that each student s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection as well as considerations related to internship opportunities housing and financial aid The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan as needed Requirements A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture language if applicable and necessary history literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program international law international labor policy global issues global institutions global conflict and negotiation and global economics A one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and possibly cultural history and literature courses taken at an international university A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience MINORS Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue a minor a coordinated set of courses which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field subject and or discipline Note Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the student s major requirements Some major minor combinations are not allowed Biomedical Computing 1 courses Digital Information Systems 7 courses Informatics 8 courses Information and Computer Science 7 courses Statistics 7 courses OPPORTUNITIES FOR HONORS LEVEL STUDY Students who are
