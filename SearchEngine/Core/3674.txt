In this paper, we show hardness of a classical tiling\nproblem on an (NxN) 2-dimensional grid and a quantum problem involving\nfinding the ground state energy of a 1-dimensional quantum system of\nN particles.  In both cases, the only input is N, provided in\nbinary.  We show that the classical problem is NEXP-complete and\nthe quantum problem is QMAEXP-complete.  Thus, an algorithm\nfor these problems which runs in time polynomial in N (exponential\nin the input size) would imply that\nEXP = NEXP or BQEXP = QMAEXP, respectively. Although tiling in general\nis already known to be NEXP-complete, to our knowledge, all\nprevious reductions require that either the set of tiles and their constraints\nor some varying boundary conditions be given as part of the input.\nIn the problem considered here, these are fixed, constant-sized parameters\nof the problem. Instead, the problem instance is encoded solely in the\nsize of the system.\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3674.0}
