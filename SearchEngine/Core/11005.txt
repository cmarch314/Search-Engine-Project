properties and it s quite hopeful that one could use these to disprove its existence so proving that the invariant must be Well I just typed out what I was trying to make work but I think I just found a counterexample Consider the x y z upper half plane model and the convex hull of the vertices 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and 1 In other words a 2x2 square in the height 2 horosphere and 4 1x1 squares in the height 1 horosphere Of course the top square is congruent to the bottom squares By translations in 2Zx2Z this shape tiles a region around the horosphere of height 2 This region is congruent to regions around the horospheres of height 2 n for all integers n these tile H 3 Now this shape probably doesn t have Dehn invariant But even if it does a small polygonal bump added to the top allows the same bump to be taken 4 times out of the bottom So choose the bump to have nonzero Dehn invariant D and the new shape will have Dehn invariant 3D On the other hand of course if it needn t be this could of course be proved by exhibiting just one special tiling I hope the above works but I ve been up for some time so I actually can t see it The paradoxical nature of the required tiling reminds me of another problem that of defining the density of a sphere packing in hyperbolic space For foams in H 2 and H 3 I didn t find anything I could compute What happens if you take the lim sup of the density within balls of increasing radius centered about each point p to get a function of p and then iterate using the average value instead of density I have read of a counterexample packing of spheres with the following properties i There are two tilings T1 and T2 of the space into polyhedral cells that each contain just one of the spheres ii Each of T1 and T2 admits an automorphism group of isometries that act transitively on its cells so that all the cells of Ti have the same volume Vi iii The volumes V1 and V2 are different and both finite That is disturbing if the spheres are in any way symmetric or fairly large in comparison to V1 and V2 Otherwise it still disturbs me but I suspect that frequently there exists a matching between the sets of tiles of two tilings given that the tiles have large diameter with respect to the ratio of their volumes where a tile of T1 is adjacent to a tile of T2 iff their intersection contains a ball of radius r Does anyone know a reference for this
