The curriculum covers the infrastructure of computers and networks, as well as the software that runs them. Students receive a broad view of the field through a comprehensive set of core classes and, through upper-division elective courses, are given the opportunity to specialize in topics such as machine learning, data mining, distributed and embedded systems, and security. The major places a heavy emphasis on \u201clearning by doing\u201d through a wide selection of classes in which students design and build in-depth projects over the course of a 10-week quarter. In addition, students receive a solid background in computer algorithms, which form the basis of modern computing. The major provides many practical skills that can be immediately put to use in the workplace while also giving students a conceptual foundation that will serve them well for the long term in a rapidly evolving field. <DIV CLASS=\"clear\"></DIV>\r\n</DIV>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P CLASS=\"section_heading\"><a href=\"#\">WHAT COURSES DO I TAKE?</A> <span></span> </P>\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"section_content\">\r\n<P>\r\nCurrent Requirements for the CS major can be found in the <A HREF=\"http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/\">General Catalogue</A>.\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"clear\"></DIV>\r\n</DIV>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P CLASS=\"section_heading\"><a href=\"#\">WHAT CAN I DO WITH A DEGREE IN CS?</A> <span></span> </P>\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"section_content\">\r\n<P>\r\nGraduates of the Computer Science program at UCI will be in a position to pursue a variety of \r\ncareers in high-demand areas such as embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, web services, \r\ncomputer security, networking and data mining. They can be principal designers or involved in \r\nimplementation, typically at companies that design, implement and sell or manage products or \r\nservices in such areas. They may find themselves in charge of large-scale deployments and/or \r\ncustomizations at the organizations that use them. \r\n<P>\r\nThe strong scientific preparation also allows students to become involved in such areas as \r\nhigh-performance computing, computational biology and neuroscience  \u2014 whether in industry or \r\ngraduate school. In fact, many students choose to continue their studies, conducting research and \r\nearning graduate degrees in fields such as computer science, software engineering or information \r\nscience. A background in computer science is also excellent preparation for careers in management, \r\nlaw, finance or consulting. \r\n<DIV CLASS=\"clear\"></DIV>\r\n</DIV>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</DIV>  <!-- #expandable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             \r\n             <p class=\"image-fig\">\r\n                 <img src=\"/prospective/img/degrees-cs-img.jpg\" alt=\"Chen Li, associate professor of computer science, and his students created a Web search tool to reunite people after the quake that devastated Haiti.\" />\r\n                 <cite STYLE=\"display: block; width: 434px; \">Chen Li, associate professor of computer science, and his students created a Web search tool to reunite people after the quake that devastated Haiti. </cite>\r\n                 </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style \">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pubid=xa-4d7e35ad5fb0fe07\" class=\"addthis_button_compact\">Share</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"addthis_separator\">|</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_1\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_2\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_3\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_4\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">var addthis_config = { ui_language: 'en' };</script>\r\n\t\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=xa-4d7e35ad5fb0fe07\"></script>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div id=\"footer\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lang-selector\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Language: </strong>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/en/degrees/computer-science/\" class=\"active\">English</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/zh-tw/degrees/computer-science/\" class=\"\">Chinese (Traditional)</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/ko/degrees/computer-science/\" class=\"\">Korean</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/vi/degrees/computer-science/\" class=\"\">Vietnamese</a>\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"footer-left\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t    <p>University of California, Irvine - Irvine, CA 92697 : 949-824-5011</p>\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"links\">\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/comments.php\" target=\"_blank\">Comments & Questions</a> |\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/privacy.php\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy & Legal Notice</a> |\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\" target=\"_blank\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\r\n                    &copy; 2015 UC Regents\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"footer-right\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.crispbrandagency.com/\" class=\"crisp image-text\" target=\"_blank\">Site By Crisp</a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "id": 7813.0}
