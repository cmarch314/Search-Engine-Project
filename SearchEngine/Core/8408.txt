Backtracking may be viewed as a systematic \"guessing\" of variable \r\nassignments, while resolution is inferring, or \"thinking\". Experimental results show\r\nthat \"pure guessing\" or \"pure thinking\" might be inefficient. We propose an \r\napproach that combines both techniques and yields a family of hybrid algorithms,\r\nparameterized by a bound on the \"effective\" amount of resolution allowed. The\r\nidea is to divide the set of propositional variables into two classes: conditioning\r\nvariables, which are assigned truth values, and resolution variables, which are \r\nresolved upon. We report on preliminary experimental results demonstrating that\r\non certain classes of problems hybrid algorithms are more efficient than either\r\nof their components in isolation.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r49-toguessorthinkCP96.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r49-toguessorthinkCP96.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8408.0}
