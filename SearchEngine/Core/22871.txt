The examples on these pages \nwere all compass-and-straightedge constructible, but some Koebe embeddings \nare not.  For instance, any realization of the heptagonal bipyramid\n(i.e., a seven-circle <A HREF=\"steiner.html\">Steiner \nporism</A>) could be used to construct a regular heptagon (known to be \nimpossible) since seven circles through triples of its tangencies meet at \na common point and form angles of pi/7 there.\n\n<P>Finally, it seems to be unknown which nonplanar graphs can be realized as tangencies \nof (non-disjoint) circles.  Any set of disjoint circles has a circle with \ndegree at most five, but nondisjoint circles can have arbitrary degree (for \ninstance, any hypercube skeleton can be realized).
