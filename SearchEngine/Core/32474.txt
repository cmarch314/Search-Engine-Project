{"text": " This page describes what will be expected of each student in this class and how grades will be computed If any of these policies are unclear or if you believe them to be unfair in any way please contact the instructor and include CS112 somewhere in the subject line Any changes in policy will be announced in class and recorded on this page Attendance Students are strongly encouraged to attend every lecture Although much of what is discussed in class will also be covered by supporting materials distributed in class and avaiable on the downloads page there will be important information that you will miss if you are not in class If you must miss a class for any reason you are encouraged to obtain notes from a fellow student who attended the lecture If that is impossible please contact the TA or the instructor You will be responsible for all the material covered in class and it is your job to stay informed if you miss a class Homework and exams There will be approximately five homework assignments a midterm exam and a final exam You will have between one and two weeks to complete each homework assignment and each assignment will carry equal weight Your work will be judged on correctness completeness and clarity Clarity includes but is not limited to easy to follow logical structure and documentation commenting of programs as well as legibility and adequacy of explanations that accompany proofs and other written portions Even brilliant ideas have little value if they are not communicated clearly Consequently work that is hastily conceived and or scribbled on ripped out notebook pages will be unlikely to receive a high score Grades Grades will be based on the homeworks 65 the midterm 15 and the final exam 2 Exceptions may be made in the case of students who perform exceptionally well on the homework or an exam In this case the instructor reserves the right to adjust the final score upward Other factors such as attendance participation in class and extra credit work see bonus problems below may also favorably influence your grade Final letter grades will be assigned using a curve that is the grade cutoffs will be based in part on the performance of the class as a whole Typically passing grades begin at about 6 with the A range beginning in the mid to high 8 s However these ranges vary from class to class If you have concerns about how you are doing in the class please contact the instructor Bonus problems On some assignments you will be given the opportunity to submit solutions to one or more bonus problems which go beyond the required homework If you choose not to do the bonus problems it will not affect your grade To ensure fairness bonus work will be handled in the following manner All credit that is earned through bonus problems will be tallied separately and will not be taken into consideration until all final grades have been tentatively assigned As a final step in the grading process those students who have earned a significant number of bonus points may have their grades adjusted upward by as much as a full letter grade although half a grade is more typical Those students whose grades are on the borderline between two grades are most likely to benefit from having accumulated bonus points Submitting your homework Written homework should normally be submitted at the beginning of class on the day that it is due If you submit late homework you may drop it off at the TA s office Programmming assignments should be submitted electronically using EEE uploading them to the appropriate drop box When uploading electronic submissions please submit only ONE file a zipped folder containing all the files you wish to submit which will typically include one or more source files images sample output etc Please do NOT submit binary files such as executables and project files unless explicitly requested to do so in the assignment Picking up your homework Graded homeworks may be picked up from the TA s office We recommend that you first check EEE once the grade is posted the homework should be available for pick up Extensions and late homework Each student will automatically be granted an additional 48 hours on any graded item upon written request via email to a TA not the instructor made on or before the due date which is to include a one or two sentence explanation of the circumstances In particular please state whether your request is a result of difficulties you are having with the material or due to other circumstances which you need not go into detail about Note that the extension will always be granted regardless of the reason but only one such extension will be granted per homework We ask that you supply a brief expalantion so that we might be alerted to problems that may warrant some corrective action on behalf of the entire class e g a homework problem that should be explained more fully or worded differently The automatic extension policy does not apply to exams Medical exceptions are always honored however Other exceptions may be made due to special circumstances upon request from the instructor Homeworks that are submitted late which means after the extended date if an extension was requested will be penalized at a rate of up to 1 per day late Please see the instructor if you are significantly behind or have homework that is more than a week late It is always advisable to submit homework however even if it is incomplete and or very late Questions about grades If you have questions about the way your homework was graded or feel that you deserve a higher score first discuss the matter with the grader or the TA If you are unable to resolve the issue satisfactorily with the grader or the TA then bring it to the attention of the instructor In all email correspondence with the instructor TA or grader please be sure to include CS112 somewhere in the subject line Your email may be overlooked if you forget to do this Class participation Questions and comments during class are always welcomed If you are having difficulty following a discussion you are likely not alone Please ask for clarification or elaboration when necessary or inject relevant comments and observations While class participation is not explicity part of the grading for this class the instructor reserves the right to reward students who regularly participate in class and thereby enrich the learning experience of others Collaboration You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with your peers on homeworks as such communication is one of the most valuable opportunities for learning However collaboration as it is to be understood in this class does not include copying the work of another nor exchanging complete solutions verbally in writing or in any other form with another student in the class Please see the page on intellectual honesty Collaboration implies exploring ideas together not transfering completed work or any portion thereof The latter constitutes plagiarism and will be dealt with harshly if it is discovered Each act of plagiarism will be documented and reported to the dean and will be sufficient grounds for failing every student involved including those who knowingly provided the plagiarized material In general each student must write homework solutions and programs entirely on their own although the ideas leading up to those solutions and programs may have been developed or discovered in consultation with one or more class members Any exceptions will be noted in class and explained on the announcements portion of the discussion board and or in the homework itself If you are unsure whether some activity falls within the boundaries of legitimate collaboration please ask the instructor or the TA Courtesy toward others Beyond the narrow technical requirements of this class each student will be expected to represent his her work honestly and to be fair and respectful toward others in the class As one minor example please refrain from carrying on conversations with your neighbor in class once the class has begun as even hushed voices can be heard throughout a classroom and can be a significant distraction Also please try to arrive on time as students who enter late tend to disrupt the class and are apt to miss announcements Feedback If you wish to receive feedback from us concerning your performance in the class please make an appointment to speak with the TA or the instructor In addition feedback from you is essential in keeping the level of the lectures and homework assignments tuned to the class Please let us know in class during office hours via email to the instructor or even via the discussion board if you are having unexpected difficulties in the class or wish to share comments of any other nature Above all if you are falling behind it is much easier to take corrective action if this is made known early on rather than waiting until the end of the quarter ", "_id":
