play an important role in facilitating the balance of the three factors of Cost Schedule and Quality COQUALMO is an estimation model focusing on quality but its ties to COCOMO II provide estimation models in the other two areas Dr Chulani will present the model and the initial results to date CORADMO Constructive RAD Schedule Model A Winsor Brown Assistant Director Center for Software Engineering AWBrown sunset usc edu Many generic RAD techniques are applied to reduce schedule sometimes with an accompanying increase in total effort One of the bases for this model came from a behavioral analysis of a set of RAD drivers suggested by a CSE Workshop on RAD Another component of the model comes from a staged schedule and effort distribution model based on Dr Boehm s Anchor Points and the Rational Unified Process model The conceptual model has been implemented in a spreadsheet that is linked to the output of COCOMO II 1999 COCOTS Constructive COTS Model PDF Christopher M Abts Graduate Research Assistant Center for Software Engineering School of Engineering University of Southern California Cabts sunset usc edu Off the shelf software integration cost modeling focuses on estimating the cost effort and schedule associated with using commercial off the shelf COTS components in a software development project Though still experimental COCOTS is a model complementary to COCOMO II capturing costs that traditionally have been outside the scope of COCOMO 1 candidate COTS component assessment 2 COTS component tailoring 3 the development and testing of any integration or glue code needed to plug a COTS component into a larger system and 4 increased system level programming due to volatility in incorporated COTS components COCOTS is envisioned as working in concert with COCOMO II to provide a complete software development cost estimation solution COPROMO Constructive Productivity Improvement Model Barry Boehm TRW Professor of Computer Science and Director Center for Software Engineering Univ of Southern California Boehm sunset usc edu Constructive Productivity Improvement Model COPROMO is a Software Engineering Senior Management strategic planning decision assistant model It is supported by an implementation approach The model is based on the use of COCOMO II and CORADMO as valuation mechanisms The implementation approach uses a representative application from the domain of concern to the senior management and the identification of technology drivers and time frames Also a technology impact evaluation tool exists one version of the tool has been implemented and used in the evaluation of the Knowledge Based Software Assistant Biographies Dr Barry Boehm Between 1989 and 1992 Barry Boehm served within the U S Department of Defense DoD as Director of the DARPA Information Science and Technology Office and as Director of the DDR E Software and Computer Technology Office He worked at TRW from 1973 to 1989 culminating as Chief Scientist of the Defense Systems Group Other positions include Rand Corporation culminating as head of the Information Sciences Department and General Dynamics His current research interests focus on integrating a software system s process models product models property models and success models via an approach called MBASE Model Based Architecting and Software Engineering His contributions to the
