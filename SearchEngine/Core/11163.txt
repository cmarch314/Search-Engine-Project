It turns out to\nbe hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways\nis best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"geom.html\">Geometry</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
