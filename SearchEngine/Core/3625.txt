Our techniques are applicable to technical\nanalysis, portfolio theory, and nonlinear market models. We find\nthat lossy and lossless compression techniques are well suited for\npredicting stock prices as well as market modes such as strong\ntrends and major adjustments. We also present novel applications of\nmultispectral compression techniques to portfolio theory,\ncorrelation of similar stocks, effects of interest rates,\ntransaction costs and taxes.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3625.0}
