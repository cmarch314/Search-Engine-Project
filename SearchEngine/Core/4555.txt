{"text": "ICS 31 DAVID G KAY UC IRVINE WINTER 2 15 Assignments For ease of access we ve moved the introduction down below the assignment list But it s a good idea to read it again once or twice Assignments Lab Assignment 1 due on January 9 Setup Python IDLE Checkmate Python expressions and types Lab Assignment 2 due on January 16 Input and output simple lists namedtuples drawing with tkinter Lab Assignment 3 due on January 23 Programmer defined functions combining data structures control structures for selection and repetition drawing with tkinter Lab Assignment 4 due on January 3 More on programmer defined functions control structures for selection and repetition combining data structures drawing with tkinter Lab Assignment 5 due on February 6 Creating combining processing namedtuples lists lists of namedtuples namedtuples containing lists Text processing Lab Assignment 6 due on February 13 Random numbers printing formatted output histograms cryptography and Caesar ciphers I text processing text statistics enhancing the restaurants program Lab Assignment 7 due on February 2 Random names cryptanalysis file copying with statistics Stay tuned As you re waiting for the next assignment to appear you can be pretty safe reading ahead in the text whichever one you re using So long as you don t get stuck too long on any topic before we mention it in class at worst you ll just learn something new that you won t be tested on We know it s possible to find previous quarters versions of the next assignments on line There may be changes large or small between previous versions and the official version for this quarter when it is posted If you turn in a solution to a previous quarter s assignment it may look as if you copied the solution from a previous student so if you do work ahead on an unofficial version of the assignment be sure to check your solution against the officially published assignment from this quarter Read this introduction at the beginning of the course but read it again in a couple of weeks Each week there will be a lab assignment due on Friday typically the following week s assignment will also be available on Friday Each assignment will have two parts Preparation which you will do individually over the weekend These will usually involve some reading and a few short problems to introduce you to a topic and help prepare you to ask questions and work in the lab the following week Lab work which you will do in pairs and submit electronically at the end of your lab session the following Friday The lab assignments will require you to do pair programming You and a classmate will work together at one computer following specific guidelines This makes the scheduled lab hours on Monday Wednesday Friday particularly valuable as a time when everyone in the class is certain to be available along with the TA and lab tutors At the beginning of each assignment most weeks on Friday you will choose a partner for the next lab You will receive an Email message with a link to the partner selection web page This works like Facebook You can invite someone to partner with you the partnership is formed only if they accept the invitation You can t just partner up informally you must follow the process on the web page to get credit for the partnership and the work you do At the end of each assignment most weeks on Friday you will evaluate your partner for that lab You will receive an Email message with a link to the partner evaluation web page You must evaluate each partnership filling out an evaluation counts towards your participation score We encourage you to talk with each other and help each other understand how to do the assignments There are some limits though Everyone should read the guidelines for collaboration and independent work Really read it People who ignore it risk serious trouble Don t expect every answer to every problem to be immediately obvious If you find yourself stuck on a problem take these five steps 1 Re read the problem 2 follow the design recipe which we will describe in class 3 go back and look at how you or we solved similar problems 4 recheck the explanation in the textbook or lecture notes and 5 if you ve spent three solid minutes thinking about the problem without making any progress it s time to ask somebody a classmate TA tutor or Piazza If you re making progress if you have an educated guess not a blind guess about what to try next then keep going we re not saying that every problem can be solved completely in three minutes But after you ve spent three minutes of hard thinking with no progress and no idea of what to do next more thinking alone isn t likely to help We want to minimize your frustration nobody should be spending hours working on a problem without making progress If you re stuck we or sometimes your classmates can often get you past your trouble pretty quickly If you haven t followed the steps above though especially reading the problem and following the design recipe we ll probably just send you back to do them You have to do your part but after that we re happy to step in and do ours David G Kay kay uci edu Friday February 13 2 15 7 53
