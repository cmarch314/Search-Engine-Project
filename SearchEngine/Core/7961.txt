ICS2 Rm 249 Discussions 1 2 5 Tues Thurs in ICS 183 189 192 Course Goals Using the Java language students will learn the properties and implementation details of the fundamental data structures arrays lists queues stacks dictionaries hashtables trees graphs that often are at the heart of any program Students will also learn basic problem solving methods such as divide and conquer separate and conquer dynamic programming greedy algorithms tree and search algorithms as well as some useful applications As part of the coding assigments students will be expected to analyse their code and follow good object oriented design Grading There will be four programming assignments 4 quizzes and a final The course is not graded on a curve Roughly the homeworks count 4 the quizzes 2 and the final 4 I don t use a formula to assign grades Trends matter You need to pass both the homeworks and the final to pass the class The lowest quiz score will be dropped If you can t make a quiz then that quiz is the one that is dropped The coding assignments will be in Java Roughly the exams and homeworks will count equally The final exam will be based on the text lecture notes and homeworks Each chapter ends with a summary Be sure that you know every concept discussed in the summary The fastest way to get questions answered is to email either the TAs or me Answers of general interest will be posted on the bulletin board ics 23 You may also use the bulletin board to ask classmates for appropriate help Any form of inappropriate help will result in an F grade in the class and a letter in your file If you are unsure whether the type of help you are seeking is appropriate imagine that you are video taped and the tape was shown to me The homeworks focus on using arrays lists trees hashing and sorting Grades are posted at http www ics uci edu javid ICS23 grades htm Knowledge Prerequisites You should be familiar with arrays linked lists and unbalanced binary trees By familiar I mean that you have implemented these data structures and are confident with dealing with them Additional you should have the a rudimentary knowledge of O notation in particular the ability to analyze programs that involve multiple loops but not programs that involve recursion It is also expected that you are familiar with Java but not with Gui interfaces My experience is that students who know C can learn enought of Java in just a few hours to write programs required for this class Text Text Data Structures and Problem Solving using Java by Mark Allen Weiss Suggested for those interested in GUI s UP to

stacks, dictionaries, hashtables, trees, graphs) that often are at the heart\r\nof any program. Students will also learn basic problem solving methods, such as divide and conquer, separate and\r\nconquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, tree and search algorithms as well as some useful applications.\r\nAs part of the coding assigments, students will be expected to analyse their code and follow good object-oriented\r\ndesign. \r\n<HR ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\r\n\r\n<H2>Grading</H2>\r\n<P>There will be four programming assignments, 4 quizzes and a final. The course is not graded on a curve. Roughly\r\nthe homeworks count 40%, the quizzes 20%, and the final 40%. I don't use a formula to assign grades. Trends matter.\r\nYou need to pass both the homeworks and the final to pass the class. The lowest quiz score will be dropped. If\r\nyou can't make a quiz, then that quiz is the one that is dropped. The coding assignments will be in Java. Roughly,\r\nthe exams and homeworks will count equally. The final exam will be based on the text, lecture notes, and homeworks.\r\nEach chapter ends with a summary. Be sure that you know every concept discussed in the summary. The fastest way\r\nto get questions answered is to email either the TAs or me. Answers of general interest will be posted on the bulletin\r\nboard (ics.23). You may also use the bulletin board to ask classmates for appropriate help. Any form of inappropriate\r\nhelp will result in an F grade in the class and a letter in your file.
