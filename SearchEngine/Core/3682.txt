We\ncan now look at the smallest square in this squared square.  It is then\nthe face of some cube surrounded by four larger cubes, which we can look\nat the opposite face of, and so on: since this process can be continued \nindefinitely, there can be no cubed cube.\n\nThe difference between 2D and 3D is in the starred statement.  The smallest\nline in a segmented segment can be on the boundary, but the smallest square in \na squared square cannot be.\n-- \nDavid Moews                                <A HREF=\"mailto:dmoews@xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu\">dmoews@xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu</A>\n</PRE>\n", "id": 3682.0}
