message last October with this title asking for the largest equilateral triangle that can be placed without self intersection in the square torus I think I have one Equivalently this is asking for the densest packing of the plane by disjoint equilateral triangles translated to the vertices of the integer square lattice There is really only one parameter left to optimize the angle of the triangle you can grow triangles with a given angle until they touch each other giving a function f theta which is the largest square lattice packing of equilateral triangles at angle theta Actually this is defined only mod 3 degrees since rotating a triangle by that amount places it in an equivalent position It seems from inspection that in the range theta 3 f theta has a unique maximum at 15 degrees at which point when you do the triangle growing process described above you hit two other triangles simultanously I ve drawn a picture of the corresponding packing in http www ics uci edu eppstein junkyard tripack gif and ps I haven t gone through a rigorous proof that this is the only answer or computed the size of the resulting triangle but both of these steps look completely mechanical David

Mar 1996 9 46 35 8 From David Eppstein eppstein ICS UCI EDU Following up on my message of yesterday This is asking for the densest packing of the plane by disjoint equilateral triangles translated to the vertices of the integer square lattice There is really only one parameter left to optimize the angle of the triangle you can grow triangles with a given angle until they touch each other giving a function f theta which is the largest square lattice packing of equilateral triangles at angle theta Actually this is defined only mod 3 degrees It seems from inspection that in the range theta 3 f theta has a unique maximum at 15 degrees I now have a nice non mechanical proof of this Given an angle theta I want to describe how to compute f theta as defined above Let point A B 1 C 1 I m a computational geometer I use coordinates Everything here can be done in compass straightedge but who cares Draw lines L1 through A at angle theta L2 through A at angle theta 6 L3 through B at angle theta L4 through C at angle theta 6 Let D intersection L2 L3 and E intersection L1 L4 Then f theta min distance A D distance A E You also have to worry about your triangle covering point 1 1 but that turns out not to be a problem So what does f theta look like and where is its maximum Let s look at distance A D As theta varies from to 3 angle BDA stays fixed at 6 degrees Therefore D traces out a curve of constant angle namely a circle in which AB forms a 12 degree chord From this we can see that distance AD increases monotonically as theta increases from to 3 Symmetrically distance AE decreases monotonically Since neither distance has a local maximum in this range the maximum of f theta occurs where the two are equal which by symmetry is at theta 15 degrees QED I still haven t computed the size of the triangle at that angle but it s a simple question of trigonometry what s the ratio of hypotenuse to middle side in a 15 6 1 5 triangle David Eppstein UC Irvine Dept of

equilateral triangles and Geometry Junkyard Mr David Eppstein I stumbled across your Geometry Junkyard and was very pleased to find such a wealth of great questions and ideas I was even more surprised that you had addressed a problem equilateral triangle question by Dan Asimov to which I had made a conjecture Your note on the web page indicates that your solution of a triangle with sides of 2 units corrects a previous attempt I assume this refers to my post of 1 26 95 indicating appx 2 15 as a solution I did however follow up on 1 29 95 with a second statement that improved the original guess with a general conjecture about ALL triangles not just equilateral triangles and in fact I made a conjecture about any convex polygon which I now realize was very wrong Because I almost never have the opportunity to discuss these kinds of problems with people of your experience I would love to have you address the general conjecture I made about a triangle that contains a unit square in the 1 29 95

points but have no proof I think the other part of your conjecture that a triangle that doesn t contain a unit square can avoid all integer points is true Just place the triangle with one side along the x axis y Since it doesn t contain the unit square it in particular doesn t contain a unit square aligned with the coordinate axes in this placement and therefore there is enough room for its top
