{"text": "Redirect References Last Call Issues ID Source Description Status Disposition 1 Orton Entity Bodies for Redirect References Clarify Are there 2 resources one that redirects and one that responds with its own entity body Clarify What is the effect of PUT for a URI that currently maps to a redirect reference Closed Redirect resource MUST NOT have a body See also issue 23 1A Orton Reuter In the definition of MKRESOURCE Body needs to be defined or else terminology changed Closed We will use MKREF instead of MKRESOURCE 2 Orton List only new status codes for MKRESOURCE Don t discuss previously defined status codes Closed Follow same practice as in binding spec for existing status codes describe new circumstances that might cause them Make it clear that we are not redefining these codes 3 Orton Reuter Saying that responses to MKRESOURCE SHOULD NOT be cached suggests that there are sometimes good reasons to cache responses Is this the case Closed Responses to MKREF MUST NOT be cached 4 Orton Standard data container needs to be defined in the context of MKRESOURCE Closed Not relevant once we switch to MKREF 5 Orton Inconsistency about whether a standard data container can be created with MKRESOURCE or not Closed Not relevant once we switch to MKREF 6 Orton Why does the spec talk about relative URIs in DAV reftarget in MKRESOURCE requests Is the server required to resolve the relative URI and store it as absolute Is the server required to keep DAV reftarget pointing to the target resource as the reference target move or is DAV reftarget a dead property Closed DAV reftarget is readonly and present only on redirect references that are also WebDAV resources Add a method for setting the target Change definition of Redirect Ref header so that it has the target as its value comes back on all 3 2 responses Server MUST store the target exactly as it is set It MUST NOT resolve relatives to absolutes and MUST NOT update if target resource moves See also issue 17 43 5 57 7 Reuter Abstract should discuss only redirect references not bindings Expand discussion of redirect references Closed Abstract will discuss only redirect references See also issue 34 8 Reuter Get rid of cross references to the binding spec in the abstract in the introduction in the definition of Reference Resource Closed Cross references to bindings will be removed See also issue 34 9 Reuter Move Notational Conventions after Introduction Closed Section will be moved 1 Reuter Change the title of 16 4 so that it is not a sentence Closed Change to Revealing Private Locations 11 Reuter Don t paginate the review draft Closed We will paginate in accordance with IETF rules but will try to produce a nicely formatted review spec as well 12 Reuter First 3 paragraphs of Introduction are identical to those in binding spec Make sure that any changes made there are also incorporated here Closed These paragraphs will change as necessary to make the redirect spec completely independent of the rest of WebDAV 13 Reuter Intro para 4 Change usually to possibly in the sentence A redirect reference resource is a resource in one collection whose purpose is to forward requests to another resource its target usually in a different collection Closed Agreed 14 Reuter Limit the discussion of bindings to just what is needed to understand the differences from redirect references Maybe the paragraph in the Intro that starts By contrast a BIND request is all that is needed Closed Get rid of discussion of bindings altogether See also issue 34 35 15 Reuter Don t define Direct Reference Resource since direct references are out of scope If you do keep the definition say explicitly that a direct reference resource is a type of reference resource Closed Remove definition of Direct Reference Resource See also issue 39 16 Reuter Section 4 para 2 Change It is also what insures to It is also what helps to insure Closed Agreed 17 Reuter Section 4 para 3 Clients should use the Location header not the DAV reftarget property to find the location of the target The purpose of the DAV reftarget property should be to let the client update its value Closed We need both Location which is absolute and target which may be relative See also issue 6 43 18 Reuter Need a registration procedure for resource types to insure interoperability Closed We won t hold up this spec to establish a registration procedure We will mention in IANA considerations that as the number of resource types grows the need for a registration procedure increases but that there is none at this time 19 Reuter Section 4 para 5 and Section 6 para 3 discussions of the Apply to Redirect Ref header make it sound as if we are specifying direct reference behavior Closed Change these passages so that the contrast is between applying the method to the redirect reference and responding with a 3 2 2 Reuter Section 5 Start with The new MKRESOURCE method to make it clear that it is being introduced for the first time here Closed Say The MKREF method defined normatively here 21 Reuter Get rid of the binding dependent language in the last para of Section 5 Closed Delete all but the first sentence in this paragraph 22 Reuter Inconsistency about whether collections can be created with MKRESOURCE Closed Not relevant for MKREF 23 Reuter Section 5 1 Get rid of the statement that the body of the resource is empty PostConditions It would be good if the response to GET included a response body that could be shown to a user by a client that doesn t do automatic redirection There is a related problem in Section 6 on PUT It is wrong to assume that what is PUT to a resource is what GET will return In Section 6 say A PUT with Apply To RR MAY contain a request body The semantics of the request body is out of scope for this specification Also fix the discussion of example 6 2 Closed Redirect references cannot have bodies GET with Apply To RR MUST fail with 4 3 PUT with Apply To RR MUST fail with 4 3 See also issue 1 24 Reuter Section 5 1 Replace the sentence The properties of the new resource are as specified by the DAV propertyupdate request body using PROPPATCH semantics with the following The MKRESOURCE request MAY contain a DAV propertyupdate request body to initialize resource properties Herein the semantics is the same as when sending a MKRESOURCE request without a request body followed by a PROPPATCH with the DAV propertyupdate request body Closed No longer relevant once we switch to MKREF with no request body 25 Reuter Is MKRESOURCE atomic as viewed by a client Can another client access the new resource s properties before they have been fully initialized Maybe the MKRESOURCE request should let the client ask for it to be atomic Closed No longer relevant once we switch to MKREF with no request body 26 Reuter Change is not created to was not created in para 4 under Postconditions of MKRESOURCE Closed Editor s discretion 27 Reuter Section 6 Change non referencing aware clients to clients not aware of this protocol Closed Editor s discretion 28 Reuter Section 6 Get rid of the sentence A reference aware WebDAV client can act on this response in one of two ways A client can act on the response in any way it wants Closed Agreed See also issue 48 29 Reuter Section 6 para 4 Obvious doesn t need to be stated Maybe note in an example Closed Agreed See also issue 48 3 Reuter Section 6 When Apply To RR is used with GET or HEAD Either give a precise list of the headers that MUST be returned or change MUST to SHOULD with the list of examples Closed Delete along with all HTTP headers that make sense for reference resources for example Cache Control Age Etag Expires and Last Modified See also issue 48 31 Reuter Section 6 para on MKRESOURCE and MKCOL is obvious and doesn t need to be stated Maybe show in an example Closed Agreed See also issue 48 32 Reuter Section 6 Don t talk about ORDERPATCH since it hasn t been specified anywhere Closed Agreed See also issue 48 33 Yaron Forwarding Replace forward with redirect throughout Closed Use redirect for the behavior redirect resources do exhibit Use forward for the contrasting behavior passing a method on to the target with no client action needed Define these two terms See also issue 4 34 Yaron NoBind Remove all cross references to the binding spec Prefer also removing all mention of bindings Closed Agreed See also issues 7 8 14 35 Yaron ReallyNoBind Remove paras 6 and 8 from Intro Closed Agreed See also issue 14 36 Yaron Servers Replace server with unrelated system throughout Closed Try replacing server with host in some contexts rephrasing in passive voice in others See also issue 4 37 Yaron Integrity Intro para 7 Servers are not required to enforce the integrity of redirect references Integrity is not defined Replace with something clearer Closed Rewrite to say that the server MUST NOT update the target See also issue 6 38 Yaron Not Hierarchical The first sentence of the second paragraph of the introduction of the redirect spec asserts that the URIs of WebDAV compliant resources match to collections The WebDAV standard makes no such requirement I therefore move that this sentence be stricken Closed State the more general HTTP rationale first alternative names for the same resource then introduce the collection hierarchy rationale which applies only if you are in a WebDAV compliant space 39 Yaron NoReferenceOrDirectResource Remove the definitions of Reference and Direct Reference Resource Change the definition of Redirect Reference Resource to be Redirect Resource A resource created to redirect all requests made to it using 3 2 Found to a defined target resource Closed Agreed See also issue 15 4 Yaron 4th2nd Assorted changes to Section 4 para 2 to get rid of the word forward and the word server and remove comparison with direct references Closed See also issue 33 forward See also issue 36 server Remove discussion of direct references 41 Yaron NoWebdav 1 Make redirect references independent of the rest of WebDAV The creation method for redirect references shouldn t require an XML request body Closed We will make redirect references independent of the rest of WebDAV MKREF will not have an XML request body 42 Yaron NoWebDAV 2 Use a creation method that creates only redirect references The MKRESOURCE method hinders experiment because a user of a server who wishes to add support for the creation of a new resource type can t simply throw in another Apache module and allow it to provide the code for the new resource type They have to find the code used for MKRESOURCE and change it to support the new resource type Closed We will replace MKRESOURCE with MKREF which creates only redirect reference resources 43 Yaron NoWebDAV 3 Get rid of the DAV reftarget property Closed DAV reftarget is readonly and is present only for redirect references that are also WebDAV resources We ll also have a method for setting target Redirect Ref header returned on all 3 2 responses will have the target as its value See also issue 6 17 5 44 Yaron NoPropsIn2 7 Instead of adding an optional prop XML element to the response element in 2 7 responses define a new location XML element and a new refresource XML element Open Agree to define new XML elements that are not pseudo properties Disagreement about whether refresource is needed See issue 61 45 Yaron Sec4LastPar Suggested replacement text for this paragraph which briefly introduces Apply To Redirect Ref Includes a note that even with this header the response may be a 3 2 Closed See issue 19 for replacement text Disagree Redirect reference will never respond to Apply To RR with 3 2 46 Yaron S5P2S23 Remove dependency on bindings from second paragraph of section 5 Closed Agreed 47 Yaron Errors In line with his wish to get rid of the request message body of MKRESOURCE 2 7 would not be an appropriate response code The description of 4 9 might lead someone to believe that you can t create redirect references outside of WebDAV namespaces Suggests a different description Closed No longer relevant MKREF can t get a 2 7 response Revise to make it clear that the first condition will only occur in WebDAV compliant namespaces 48 Yaron S6 Replace all of section 6 with just this A redirect resource upon receiving a request without an Apply To Redirect Ref header MUST respond with a 3 2 Found response The 3 2 Found response MUST include a location header identifying the target and a Redirect Ref header If a redirect resource receives a request with an Apply To Redirect Ref header then the redirect reference resource MUST apply the method to itself rather than blindly returning a 3 2 Found response Closed Keep a summary along the lines of Yaron s proposal don t use the word blindly Keep the bullets detailing the headers to be returned Delete the rest including the examples See also issue 28 29 3 31 32 49 Yaron PUT Remove the last sentence of Example 6 2 which says that PUT replaces the reference with a different resource Closed No longer relevant Deleted this example in response to issue 48 5 Yaron BlindRedirect Replace current language explaining the purpose of the Redirect Ref header with language that simply states that it marks blind 3 2 responses from redirect resources Section 6 3 11 1 Closed Section 6 3 was removed in response to issue 48 In 11 1 change the definition of the Redirect Ref header to have the value of the target relative URI as its value Then we don t need a method for retrieving the target s relative URI Presence of the Redirect Ref header lets the client know that the resource accepts Apply To RR header and the new method for updating target Reject Yaron s suggested language but make the above changes 51 Yaron S7P1 The first sentence of this paragraph says only what s clear from RFC 2518 so will cause confusion by its presence Delete it The last sentence of this paragraph lists methods That s a bad idea Remove it Closed Delete entire paragraph 52 Yaron NoRelative Don t allow relative URIs Delete section 9 Closed Declined Some applications need relative URI 53 Yaron S1 The behavior described in this section would have a very serious impact on the efficiency of mapping Request URIs to resources in HTTP request processing Also specify another type of redirect resource that does not behave as in section 1 but instead would expose the behavior we see today in various HTTP servers that allow their users to create 3 resources Be sure we know what behavior will be if the redirect location is not an HTTP URL but say ftp Closed We won t define 2 sorts of redirect references here Servers SHOULD respond with 3 2 as described here but if they can t do that respond with 4 4 Not Found It s hard to modularize the behavior specified it impacts processing Not Found cases of all methods so you can t just add it to an HTTP server in a redirect ref module 54 Yaron S1 The Note in section 1 has the same problem pointed out in Bindings NoSlash and needs to be fixed It contradicts RFC 2518 and 2616 which both assume that a URL and the same URL may map to different resources Closed Agreed in mailing list discussions that no change is needed 55 Yaron BeKindToIANA Expand the IANA section to list all methods headers XML elements MIME types URL schemes etc defined by the spec Closed Agreed 56 Yaron NotJustHTTP Make it clear in examples and text that the redirection URI could be non HTTP Closed We agree that it is possible to create redirect references to non HTTP resources Add example 57 Yaron NoAutoUpdate Add language to forbid servers from automatically updating redirect resources when their targets move Closed Agreed See also issue 6 58 Yaron ClientUpdate There needs to be a way to update the target of a redirect reference Closed Agreed See also issues 6 43 59 Reuter Section 7 When a method is being applied to a collection with Depth let Apply To Redirect Ref contain a list of URIs This way you could have it apply to some subset of the redirect references in the collection Closed Declined Too complex no use case for it 6 Reuter Section 7 para 3 Make it clear that these are just examples of client behavior and are not meant to limit the client s behavior to these options Open Agreed to delete this paragraph Continue discussion of what information should be returned with 3 2 in multistatus Just location Also redirectref 61 Reuter Section 7 It doesn t make sense to ask future editors of RFC 2518 to define DAV location with the semantics it has here RFC 2518 should provide the information in the Location header somehow in multistatus responses but not by using properties Closed Define an XML element for location that is not a pseudo property We ll keep the recommendation that RFC 2518 add this for 3 2 responses See also issue 44 62 Reuter Section 7 It s too strong to claim that non referencing clients can t process 3 2 responses occurring in Multi Status responses They just have an extra round trip for each 3 2 Closed Remove last sentence of the paragraph that recommends changes to RFC 2518 63 Reuter Section 7 1 Is MOVE atomic from the perspective of a client Agrees that there should be no 3 2s for member redirect references but finds the rationale dubious Closed Remove 7 1 Reword 7 2 to avoid concerns with poses special problems and due to atomicity 64 Reuter Perhaps make DAV location a real property instead of DAV reftarget and require it to be an absolute URI Closed Declined Some applications need relative URI See also issue 52 65 Reuter In the case of a redirect reference resource I think the intended meaning of WebDAV is that the resource itself is the internal member to be locked not the target resource In so far I think the Apply To Redirect Ref header should implicitly always be set and a LOCK request for a collection MUST fail if in the hierarchy of collections there is an ordinary redirect reference as internal member Closed Declined Behavior will be the same for all methods No exceptions Consistency simplicity override other considerations 66 Reuter 7 3 7 4 Change Depth infinity to Depth infinity Closed Agreed 67 Reuter 7 4 The explanation should not contrast displaying the properties of the redirect ref with displaying the properties of its target but with returning a 3 2 Closed Revise as recommended 68 Reuter 7 6 The LOCK example responds with 2 7 as does the example in RFC 2518 but section 8 1 4 of RFC 2518 says if the lock cannot be granted to all resources the response MUST be 4 9 conflict Closed We ll keep 2 7 and encourage RFC 2518 to say the same This inconsistency in RFC 2518 is on the WebDAV issues list 69 Reuter 7 6 Thinks there should not be 424 returned for diary html because it is not an ancestor of a member that caused the lock to fail Closed No change needed The interpretation of dependency in the example is correct It doesn t have to do with ancestor relationship only with what caused operation to fail 7 Reuter Section 9 para 1 Maybe say that the resulting absolute URI could be any of a number of URIs depending on which URI is used in the request to identify the redirect reference Closed No change needed 71 Reuter Section 9 Base URI should be the Request URI or href minus its final segment Closed Fix this 72 Reuter Section 1 Forbid DAV reftarget from ending in Closed Make the note warn about the possibility of two slashes in a row recommend against ending target with a slash since that could result in two slashes in a row 73 Reuter Section 1 Replace the ascii art with Juergen s suggestion see his message Open 74 Reuter Section 11 1 plain HTTP 1 1 redirect find some good name for this an use it consistently Open 75 Reuter 11 2 If the Apply To Redirect Ref header is used on a request to any other sort of resource besides a redirect reference resource the server SHOULD ignore it Don t need to say this since HTP already says that any header that is not understood should be ignored Open 76 Reuter 12 2 Make DAV location a real live property get rid of the DAV reftarget property Open 77 Reuter Section 16 Change WebDAV applications to applications that implement this protocol Open 78 Reuter Section 16 4 Change directory to collection Not new to this protocol Holds for any protocol that has hierarchical access paths Open 79 Reuter Section 16 4 In some environments the owner of a resource might be able to use access control to prevent others from creating references to that resource That would not be consistent with the concept of redirect references as weak links e g think of moving a resource to a different locationo that is already the target of some redirection reference Open 8 Reuter Section 17 Could get rid of a lot of this section since this protocol extends WebDAV Just reference WebDAV Open 81 Reuter Section 17 Typo As in WebDAV Open 82 Reuter Section 18 Just reference WebDAV and say this protocol does not introduce any new considerations Open 83 Reuter References Get rid of the reference to the bindings spec Open 84 Reuter Appendix 24 1 This is not an extension but a replacement for the WebDAV definition of the response element Open 85 Jim Whitehead 3 1 2 teleconf Support creation of other than 3 2 redirects especially 3 1 Open Joe Orton http lists w3 org Archives Public w3c dist
