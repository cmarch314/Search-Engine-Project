The\nconflicts between jobs are modeled by a <i>conflict graph</i>, so\nthat the set of all concurrently running jobs must form an\nindependent set in the graph. This model is natural and general\nenough to have applications in a variety of settings; however, we\nare motivated by the following two specific applications: traffic\nintersection control and session scheduling in high speed local\narea networks with spatial reuse. For all the graphs we address, we\nfocus on the problem of minimizing the maximum response time of any\njob that enters the system. For the specific graph which arises in\nthe traffic intersection control problem, we show a simple\nalgorithm which achieves the optimal competitive ratio. Motivated\nby the second application, we also give an algorithm for interval\ngraphs.</p>\n\n<p>Since I have already presented some of the details in the upper\nbounds, I will be presenting some of the details in the lower\nbounds. The best competitive ratio achievable by any online\nalgorithm even on a path of <i>n</i> nodes is Omega(<i>n</i>). As a\nresult, we turn to scheduling with conflicts under probabilistic\nassumptions about the input. Each node <i>i</i> has a value <i>\np<sub>i</sub></i> such that a job arrives at node <i>i</i> in any\ngiven time unit with probability <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>. Arrivals at\ndifferent nodes and during different time periods are independent.\nUnder reasonable assumptions on the input sequence, we are able to\nobtain a bounded competitive ratio for an arbitrary conflict graph.\nIn addition, if the conflict graph is a perfect graph, we give an\nalgorithm whose competitive ratio converges to&nbsp;1.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we discuss simulation results for the traffic signal\ncontrol problem. Using the methodology of Recker, Ramanathan, Yu,\nand McNally and a modification of their software, we show that some\nof our algorithms achieve significant improvements over\nfull-actuated control, the most advanced traffic signal control\nmethod in the public domain.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 10947.0}
