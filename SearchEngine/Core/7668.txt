for developing scalable Big Data applications Abstract ScaleJ is a complete package it has an implicitly parallel language for programming tasks that exhibit data parallelism it also has an autotuning runtime system that can help a data parallel task survive memory pressure ScaleJ language has a dataflow invocation semantics which abstracts away low level systems issues and allows the developer to focus on high level business logic ScaleJ autotuning system uses an out of core algorithm that automatically adapts the amount of data in memory the size of data chunk processed each time and the number of worker threads to maximize performance and scalability Using ScaleJ we have achieved 3x speed up and up to 24x scalability Status Finished The paper is under submission Facade a compiler and runtime support for almost object bounded Big Data applications Abstract Popular Big Data platforms use managed object oriented programming language such as Java due to its quick development cycle and rich community resources However when object orientation meets Big Data the cost of the managed runtime system is significantly magnified and becomes a scalability prohibiting bottleneck This project aims to remove this bottleneck in Big Data applications by introducing the novel compiler framework called Facade Facade can automatically generate highly efficient data manipulation code by transforming the data path of an existing Big Data application The key to efficiency is that in the generated code the number of heap objects created for data types in each thread is statically bounded regardless of how much data an application has to process Using Facade one can obtain significantly reduced memory management costs and improved scalability Status Finished The paper is accepted in ASPLOS 15 Using this project I competed and won the third prize bronze medal in the ACM Student Research Competition in PLDI 14 This work was presented at the SoCal PLS Workshop Spring 2 14 in Harvey Mudd College Cachetor Detecting cacheable data to remove bloat Abstract Modern object oriented software commonly suffers from runtime bloat that significantly affects its performance and scalability One pattern of bloat is the work repeatedly done to compute the same data values Cachetor is a novel runtime profiling tool that is effective in exposing caching opportunities and substantial performance gains can be achieved by modifying the program to cache the reported data Status Finished This work resulted in my ESEC FSE 13 paper PDF This work was presented at the SoCal PLS Workshop Fall 2 12 in UC Riverside Others Asides from my research and programming I am very interested in individual taxation I have been volunteering with the IRS sponsored VITA program since 2 11 I am also the group s coordinator working with prospective summer interns I m proud to say that in the school of ICS our group is one of the few if any groups that have been accepting high school students and undergraduates for summer internship for a number of years The experiences have been very positive for the interns and the group Acknowledgements I greatly appreciate the Donald Bren

This paper talks about 2 papers in PLDI 2011 with the topic of solving the data structure selection problem. One approach, Brainy, uses Artificial Neural Network to train the model to make suggestion of alternative data structures. Given a program with existing choices of data structure, Brainy either will confirm the optimal use of such data structure or will suggest better data structure for performance improvement. Brainy is architecture-sensitive, different architecture might lead to different suggestions. The other, the RelC framework use concepts of relations from database community to automatically synthesize the concrete, low-level implementation of a data structure that can satisfy the specified functional dependencies. Programmers do not declare specific type of data structure, instead, provide codes of how to manipulate data.
