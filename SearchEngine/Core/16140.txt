{"text": "The Louser Langsam Family From SaulL123 aol com Date Thu 13 Jan 2 14 27 25 EST Subject Re The Langsam Family To moishe langsam com Dear Moishe It s not that I haven t done any research on the Langsam family but to tell you the truth About 15 years ago a woman with the last name of Cohen was also doing reasearch on the Langsam Spira family I gave her my information of which there is very little because of the fact that my father in law was the only survivor of his family during the Holocaust He lived in a small village in Poland and he has been deceased for 21 years What little information we do have we have gotten from my mother in law and that is pretty sketchy She knew that there were 2 uncles living in New York By the time they emigrated to the U S they were elderly Their children wanted nothing to do with these foreign cousins so all contact broke off This family tree that was put together in the eighties could find no connection with our branch of the Langsams I m really sorry that I could not be of more help Sincerely Marsha Langsam From SaulL123 aol com Date Fri 14 Jan 2 9 32 54 EST Subject Re Langsam Family To moishe langsam com Dear Moishe I located the book that was compiled by Michael Cohen Here is the information I have My father in law s father Louser had a brother possibly more than one that came to the states New York in the early part of the 19 s From the ship records that Michael Cohen discovered there were 4 brothers that came from Jurezkowa Poland They could very well be my father in law s uncles Their names were Abraham Hersh Meyer and Shajie Their parents were listed as Jacob Langsam and Leie Kabalnick Supposedly Leie Kabalnick had a brother Elias in New York Abraham came first and went to an uncle M Goldblatt in NYC He worked as a waiter at the Hotel Cecil in 191 and lived at 3 w 118th Street Louser stayed in Poland because his parents were there and raised his children my father in law being the oldest did not leave at the onset of the war as he had to take care of the farm My father in law had 3 brothers and 1 sister Israel Moishe Aaron and Rachel This is as far back as I can go since I was really lucky just to find out the names of my father in law s siblings No one bothered to ask their names for future baby namings I asked quite by accident while visiting him in the hospital shortly before he passed away We never pursued the contact of the relatives in New York and no one ever contacted us I hope this can help in some way If you find any relatives it would be nice because my husband has no one from his father s family Sincerely Marsha From SaulL123 aol com Date Fri 14 Jan 2 16 19 36 EST Subject RE langsam family To Moishe langsam com Dear Moishe As I was perusing your website I came across the log of social security numbers with births and deaths One stood out I mentioned to you that my father in law went to visit an Uncle Harry who lived in NY From the Langsam Spira book of which I have a copy The four brothers that came from my father in laws home town were probably his uncles The only one with a social security number is Harry His birth date matches The other three could possibly changed their names as was the custom at that time to sound more American The name and zip code that I pulled up are Harry Langsam Born 1892 died May 1967 and the zip 1123 Brooklyn Kings NY Has anyone laid claim to that branch The children of that Harry would be close to 8 or 85 My father in law s father probably was the eldest It would be interesting to finally meet some relatives from my father in laws side I know my husband Saul and my sister in law Nina would be thrilled I guess I should tell you I have 3 boys My eldest is 21 Jeffrey my middle is 19 Andrew and my youngest is 14 David Funny

Dear Marsha I attach a circa 1938 letter which I believe proves that we are cousins The attached letter was written to Sam Shaje Langsam when he lived with my grandfather Harry Hersh or Herse on 23rd street with my mother Emily and Uncle Bill who is cc d on this email Of the 4 brothers Meyer Abraham Hersh and Shaje Sam Shaje either never married or was a widower and lived with Harry Hersh Herse in the 193 s on 23rd street in Brooklyn Meyer Mendel died in the flu pandemic of 1917 I don t know anything about Abe perhaps Uncle Bill could tell us In any event the attached letter was given to me in 1978 by my mother when I was trying to figure out where the family came from My mother did not know who the letter was from except that it was from family in Poland She said that Uncle used to send packages to the family Well I tried to have the letter translated by a co worker who was a Holocaust survivor in 1978 he started to cry when he read the letter he said the letter was way too sad I prevailed upon him to at least tell me who the letter was from He did tell me that it was actually two letters He wrote on the attachment that the letter was from Her Luser Langsam Juriczkowa Post Woitkowa POW Dobromil Poland Of course my mother had no idea who Luser Langsam was she thought he was a cousin In reality Luser Langsam was the 5th brother who stayed behind in Poland I believe Luser

wonderful talk with Saul Here goes Bottom line we reconnected with the Langsam family here are the details this is a combination of what Richard and I learned from Mom public records Saul and Marsha Langsam my own recollection and you 1 Grandpa Pop Harry was one of five brothers Abraham Abe Meyer Mendel Shaje Sam Herse Hersh Harry and Louser pronounced loo ser They were the children of Yacov and Leia Kabalnik Langsam from the village of Jaretskowa Jaricskowa in Galicia Yacov s mother had a farm and was better off than most but Yacov although very poor apparently never asked for help from his mother Mom says that Pop once told her that there were 4 sisters as well but no one else knows of that They barely had enough to eat 2 Abe was the first one to come to America He saved money and sent for Grandpa Pop Then Grandpa saved money and sent for Meyer Mendel and then he also sent money to bring over Sam Why Louser did not come over we don t know But I speculate he had some health problem and therefore could not travel but we don t know The brothers left to avoid being conscripted into the army 3 Sam never married and he lived by himself in the Bronx I think Meyer Mendel died in the flu pandemic of 1917 4 Louser was married to Necha stayed in Poland with Yacov Grandma Leia whose Hebrew name was probably Leia Kreindel died young Mom believes that Grandpa Yacov may have actually lived until he was killed by the Nazis The only thing I have found so far from them is the letter from 1938 which is being translated 5 Louser died before the war from some illness He had children Tzvi Mordechai Langsam survived Israel Langsam 1942 Moishe Langsam 1942 Rachel Langsam 1942 Aaron Langsam 1942 Saul s father Tzvi Mordecai was the only one to survive the war from Dachau I believe everyone else died in Auschwitz but I don t know for sure He was sent to Sweden to a DP camp after the war where he married Dora He is the nephew who made contact with Grandpa Mom distinctly remembers sending packages to them in Sweden Grandpa was not certain at first who exactly he was but he told Mom that this was a person in need and they must help even if he wasn t a relative Eventually Grandpa helped to bring them over to Philadelphia Saul remembers visiting Grandpa in an apartment Mom believes they came to your wedding do you have wedding pictures you could scan and send Saul s father was your and Mom s first cousin 6 The brother Abe you mention below was married to Sadie His child Harold died young Caroline Langsam married Bob Schwartz Mom doesn t think she has an address but we are working on that 7 The other cousins Abe and Molly Langsam Mom believes that part of the family is from Romania not far from Juretskowa we are checking on that 8 Uncle Bill you could help if you have

\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n                  It's not that I haven't done any research on the Langsam \r\nfamily, but to tell you the truth,  About 15 years ago a woman with the last \r\nname of Cohen was also doing reasearch on the Langsam-Spira family.  I gave \r\nher my information of which there is very little because of the fact that my \r\nfather-in-law was the only survivor of his family during the Holocaust.  He \r\nlived in a small village in Poland and he has been deceased for 21 years.  \r\nWhat little information we do have we have gotten from my mother-in-law and \r\nthat is pretty sketchy.  She knew that there were 2 uncles living in New \r\nYork.  By the time they emigrated to the U.S. they were elderly.  Their \r\nchildren wanted nothing to do with these foreign cousins so all contact broke \r\noff.  This family tree that was put together in the eighties could find no \r\nconnection with our branch of the Langsams.\r\n           I'm really sorry that I could not be of more help.\r\n                                                             Sincerely,\r\n                                                Marsha Langsam \r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: SaulL123@aol.com \r\nDate: Fri, 14 Jan 2000 09:32:54 EST \r\nSubject: Re: Langsam Family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n           I located the book that was compiled by Michael Cohen.  Here is \r\nthe information I have:\r\n           My father-in-law's father, Louser had a brother (possibly more \r\nthan one) that came to the states (New York) in the early part of the 1900's. \r\n From the ship records that Michael Cohen discovered, there were 4 brothers \r\nthat came from Jurezkowa Poland.  They could very well be my father-in-law's \r\nuncles.  Their names were Abraham, Hersh, Meyer, and Shajie.  Their parents \r\nwere listed as Jacob Langsam and Leie Kabalnick.  Supposedly, Leie Kabalnick \r\nhad a brother Elias in New York. Abraham came first and went to an uncle M. \r\nGoldblatt in NYC.  He worked as a waiter at the Hotel Cecil in 1910 and lived \r\nat 30 w. 118th Street.\r\n              Louser stayed in Poland because his parents were there and \r\nraised his children, my father-in-law being the oldest, did not leave at the \r\nonset of the war as he had to take care of the farm.\r\n               My father-in-law had 3 brothers and 1 sister. Israel, Moishe, \r\nAaron and Rachel.\r\n                This is as far back as I can go since I was really lucky just \r\nto find out the names of my father-in-law's siblings.

One stood out.  I mentioned to you \r\nthat my father-in-law went to visit an Uncle Harry who lived in NY.  From the \r\nLangsam-Spira book (of which I have a copy)  The four brothers that came from \r\nmy father-in-laws home town  were probably his uncles.  The only one with a \r\nsocial security number is Harry.  His birth date matches.  The other three \r\ncould possibly changed their names, as was the custom at that time, to sound \r\nmore American.  The name and zip code that I pulled up are Harry Langsam Born \r\n1892, died May 1967  and the zip 11230 Brooklyn Kings NY.  Has anyone laid \r\nclaim to that branch?  The children of that Harry would be  close to 80 or \r\n85. My father-in-law's father probably was the eldest.  It would be \r\ninteresting to finally meet some relatives from my father-in-laws side.  I \r\nknow my husband, Saul and my sister-in-law Nina would be thrilled.\r\n          I guess I should tell you, I have 3 boys.  My eldest is 21 \r\n(Jeffrey) my middle is 19 (Andrew) and my youngest is 14(David)\r\n Funny how some of the same names keep cropping up.\r\n       If I can be of any more help or if you come across anything else, \r\nplease let me know.\r\n                                                    Marsha Langsam\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nFrom: SaulL123@aol.com \r\nDate: Sun, 16 Jan 2000 21:33:30 EST \r\nSubject: Re: langsam family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n                   The information in the book by Susan Wynne is more than I \r\nwas able to find out.

The attached letter was written to Sam (Shaje) Langsam\r\nwhen he lived with my grandfather Harry (Hersh or Herse) on 23rd street\r\n(with my mother Emily and Uncle Bill--who is cc'd on this email). Of\r\nthe 4 brothers, Meyer, Abraham, Hersh and Shaje, Sam/Shaje either never\r\nmarried or was a widower--and lived with Harry (Hersh/Herse)in the\r\n1930's on 23rd street in Brooklyn. Meyer/Mendel died in the flu\r\npandemic of 1917. I don't know anything about Abe--perhaps Uncle Bill\r\ncould tell us. In any event, the attached letter was given to me in\r\n1978 by my mother when I was trying to figure out where the family came\r\nfrom. My mother did not know who the letter was from, except that it\r\nwas from family in Poland. She said that Uncle used to send packages to\r\nthe family. Well, I tried to have the letter translated by a co-worker\r\nwho was a Holocaust survivor in 1978--he started to cry when he read the\r\nletter--he said the letter was way too sad. I prevailed upon him to at\r\nleast tell me who the letter was from. (He did tell me that it was\r\nactually two letters). He wrote on the attachment that the letter was\r\nfrom: Her. Luser Langsam, Juriczkowa, Post Woitkowa, POW. Dobromil,\r\nPoland. Of course, my mother had no idea who Luser Langsam was--she\r\nthought he was a cousin. In reality, Luser Langsam was the 5th brother\r\nwho stayed behind in Poland. I believe Luser is your grandfather, Uncle\r\nBill's uncle, and Richard and mine, great uncle. I have no idea what\r\nthe rest of the letter says. Please see what you can do to have the\r\nletter translated (and let's share the info of course)--I am also trying\r\nfrom my end.

Here goes:\r\n\r\nBottom-line--we reconnected with the Langsam family--here are the\r\ndetails (this is a combination of what Richard and I learned from Mom,\r\npublic records, Saul and Marsha Langsam, my own recollection, and you):\r\n\r\n1. Grandpa (Pop) Harry was one of five brothers--Abraham/Abe,\r\nMeyer/Mendel, Shaje/Sam, Herse/Hersh/Harry and Louser (pronounced\r\nloo-ser). They were the children of Yacov and Leia (Kabalnik) Langsam,\r\nfrom the village of Jaretskowa/Jaricskowa in Galicia. Yacov's mother\r\nhad a farm and was better off than most--but Yacov, although very poor,\r\napparently never asked for help from his mother. Mom says that Pop once\r\ntold her that there were 4 sisters as well--but no one else knows of\r\nthat. They barely had enough to eat.\r\n\r\n2. Abe was the first one to come to America. He saved money and sent\r\nfor Grandpa/Pop. Then Grandpa saved money and sent for Meyer/Mendel and\r\nthen he also sent money to bring over Sam. Why Louser did not come over\r\nwe don't know. But I speculate he had some health problem and therefore\r\ncould not travel--but we don't know. The brothers left to avoid being\r\nconscripted into the army.\r\n\r\n3. Sam never married--and he lived by himself in the Bronx--I think.\r\nMeyer/Mendel died in the flu pandemic of 1917.\r\n\r\n4. Louser was married to Necha, stayed in Poland with Yacov. Grandma\r\nLeia, whose Hebrew name was probably Leia Kreindel-- died young--Mom\r\nbelieves that Grandpa Yacov may have actually lived until he was killed\r\nby the Nazis. The only thing I have found so far from them is the letter\r\nfrom 1938 which is being translated.\r\n\r\n5. Louser died before the war from some illness. He had children: Tzvi\r\nMordechai Langsam (survived), Israel Langsam - 1942; Moishe Langsam\r\n- 1942; Rachel Langsam - 1942; Aaron Langsam - 1942. Saul's father\r\n(Tzvi Mordecai?), was the only one to survive the war--from Dachau. I\r\nbelieve everyone else died in Auschwitz--but I don't know for sure. He\r\nwas sent to Sweden to a DP camp after the war, where he married Dora.\r\nHe is the nephew who made contact with Grandpa. Mom distinctly\r\nremembers sending packages to them in Sweden. Grandpa was not certain\r\nat first who exactly he was--but, he told Mom that this was a person in\r\nneed and they must help--even if he wasn't a relative. Eventually,\r\nGrandpa helped to bring them over to Philadelphia. Saul remembers\r\nvisiting Grandpa in an apartment. Mom believes they came to your\r\nwedding--do you have wedding pictures you could scan and send? Saul's\r\nfather was your and Mom's first cousin.\r\n\r\n6. The brother Abe you mention below was married to Sadie. His child\r\nHarold died young. Caroline Langsam married Bob? Schwartz--Mom doesn't\r\nthink she has an address--but we are working on that.\r\n\r\n7. The other cousins--Abe and Molly Langsam--Mom believes that part of\r\nthe family is from Romania--not far from Juretskowa--we are checking on\r\nthat. \r\n\r\n8. Uncle Bill--you could help if you have any addresses, phone numbers\r\nof any of the Langsams, old letters, photos, or anything else you can\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think it is very appropriate that this week--on Yom\r\nHashoah--we are reconnecting--and remembering those of our family who\r\ndied in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nRegards to all! \r\n\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Fine, Richard\" <RICHARD.Fine@tenethealth.com> \r\nSubject: RE: langsam family history \r\nDate: Thu, 5 May 2005 11:26:37 -0500 \r\nTo: \"Fine, Jeffrey\" <finej@HughesLuce.com>, \r\n\"william langson\" <billlbison@juno.com>, moishe@langsam.com \r\nCc: SaulL123@aol.com, mitchelldf@cs.com, Phf5825@aol.com, Buf11@aol.com, \r\nsfine@wam.umd.edu, daf81289@mac.com \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nJeff, thanks for summarizing all of this.

Some detail on this\r\nfamily is in my website. The exact page is:\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/h23.htm\r\n\r\nNotice the name BILLET as Mollie's surname. \r\n\r\nThe latest information I have for this tree is:\r\n1 H23 - unknown LANGSAM \r\n........ 2 Leah Langsam \r\n............ +Leibush Lustig \r\n................... 3 Ephraim Lustig \r\n................... 3 child Lustig \r\n................... 3 child Lustig \r\n................... 3 child Lustig \r\n................... 3 David Lustig \r\n............................. 4 Renee Lustig \r\n................................. +boy Aranoff \r\n........ 2 child Langsam \r\n................... 3 Abraham Langsam 1888 - 1961 of\r\nPrzemysl, Poland\r\n....................... +Mollie Billet \r\n............................. 4 Jack Langsam 1911 - 1971 \r\n................................. +Dorothy ? \r\n........................................ 5 William\r\nLangsam 1941 - \r\n............................................ +Wilma\r\nEpstein \r\n.................................................. 6\r\n  David Langsam 1964 - \r\n.................................................. 6\r\n  Debra Langsam 1967 - \r\n.................................................. 6 Adam\r\nLangsam 1968 - \r\n........................................ *2nd Wife of\r\nWilliam Langsam: \r\n............................................ +Linda ? \r\n............................. *2nd Wife of Jack Langsam: \r\n................................. +Judith ? \r\n........................................ 5 Andrew\r\nLangsam \r\n............................. 4 Milton Langsam \r\n\r\n\r\nI know that in 1985 William Langsam was in Insurance and\r\nlived in Long Island. Looking in switchboard, I find only\r\none William Langsam in all of NY. He is in Long Island, at\r\n38 Stone Hill Dr S \r\nManhasset, NY 11030-4426\r\n(516) 365-4343 \r\n\r\nIf you follow-up with him, please let me know what happens.\r\nI called him several times a few years ago, but we never\r\nactually spoke.\r\n\r\nI also have a question. You state that \"Louser died before\r\nthe war from some illness\", while the Langsam-Spira book\r\nstates that he perished in the Holocaust. Can this be\r\nclarified any further?\r\n\r\nRegarding Rich's comments, first let me once again thank\r\nhim for his very kind words. As for the Langsam manifests\r\nfrom Ellis Island, I have most of them. Let me know which\r\nones you would like and if I can email large files to you\r\nand I will send them.\r\n\r\nAs for the number of living Langsam descendents, I do not\r\nhave a current count. What I can tell you is that Pesach\r\nLangsam, our earliest known ancestor, has over 14,000 known\r\ndescendents. I am still computerizing the families, but\r\nalready have data-entered over 11,600 people. This spans\r\neleven generations. \r\n\r\nCan you identify all the new email addresses on this note?\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\n \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: william langson <billlbison@juno.com> \r\nSubject: langson family tree \r\nDate: Sat, 7 May 2005 22:57:21 -0700 \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com,finej@HughesLuce.com,RICHARD.Fine@tenethealth.com \r\n   \r\nThank you very much for all the information you have\r\nprovided to my nephews about our family.
