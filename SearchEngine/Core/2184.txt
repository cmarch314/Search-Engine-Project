Just to clarify, your program must produce <b>exactly</b> this: <A href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/master/test/pride-and-prejudice.txt\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/master/test/pride-and-prejudice.txt</A> for pride-and-prejudice.txt.

If the exercise requires an extra output (like the words containing \"z\"), it also needs to be printed into the console.</li>\n\t<li>Style constraints are violated.</li>\n\t<li>Form: is it only one source file per exercise? There has to be exactly one file per exercise. Four files in total (plus the summary) <i>(5 points)</i></li>\n\t<li>You will get points deducted if:\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>Hardcode the input file. <i>(5 points)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Don't take stop_words.txt from the parent folder. <i>(5 points)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Inappropriate data structures: we mean inefficient, or less than optimal, for the constraints (or lack of thereof) at hand. For example, if there are no special constraints on the use of data structures, lists are inappropriate for storing a large number of items that need to be searched. <i>(up to 5 points per deduction)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>Severe inefficiencies in algorithms. To clarify, your algorithms don't need to be perfect but there are some things that just shouldn't happen unless there's no other way to do it (e.g. Reading stop_words.txt multiple times instead of keeping it in a collection). <i>(Up to 5 points per deduction)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>The code isn't written following good programming practices (descriptive names, short methods, proper use of the language)? <i>(up to 5 points per deduction)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>The file has been modified after Saturday 11:59 pm. <i>(1% per hour up to 25% of the final score)</i></li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can notice, the maximum possible score is 100.
