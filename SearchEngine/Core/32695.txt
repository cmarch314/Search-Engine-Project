These variables may then be used by other \napplications you use.  For instance, the X Window System uses the value\nof the DISPLAY environment variable to determine which host, window, and \nscreen to display on.  \n</p>\n\n<H3>The CLASSPATH environment variable</H3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\nCLASSPATH is the environment variable that the Java interpretor uses to \nlook for Java byte-code (located in files that end in .class, .jar, etc.).  \nThis\nvariable must be set to include swing 1.0.1 which Chimera 2.0 uses.\n(Note: If you are using JDK 1.2 beta 3 or later, then swing 1.0.1 is already \nincluded with JFC 1.1 whicch comes\nwith it so you do not have to download swing and add it to your CLASSPATH.)\n</p>\n\n<H4>Displaying the CLASSPATH</H4>\n\n<p>\nTo display your current CLASSPATH type the command \n<br>\n<tt>echo $CLASSPATH </tt>\n<br>\nThis\ncommand asks your shell to display the string associated with the\nCLASSPATH environment variable.\n</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/no_classpath.gif\" WIDTH=\"291\"\nHEIGHT=\"71\"></CENTER>\n\n<p>\nNote: The CLASSPATH has no value.  In this example, we will construct \nthe CLASSPATH environment variable.  If you have items already in your\nCLASSPATH variable you wish to keep, consult any of these links for \nexamples on how to append to an existing CLASSPATH.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<A HREF=\"setting_jsdk_solaris.html\">\nExample of appending CLASSPATH with the path to the JSDK on Solaris</A>\n<li>\n<A HREF=\"setting_rivendell_solaris.html\">\nExample of appending CLASSPATH with the path to Rivendell on Solaris</A>\n<li>\n<A HREF=\"setting_msxml_solaris.html\">\nExample of appending CLASSPATH with the path to MSXML on Solaris</A> \n</ul>\n\n<H4>Setting the CLASSPATH to the swing files</H4>\n\n<p> To set the CLASSPATH variable, you may use the command setenv.\nFor Chimera 2.0, you need to specify the location of \nthe swing 1.0.1 file used by Chimera 2.0.\nThe swing 1.0.1 files is:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>swingall.jar\n</ul>\n<p>Note: swingall.jar includes the swing.jar, motif.jar, windows.jar, and \nbeaninfo.jar files.</p>\n\n<p> You can use the setenv command in the following way when you\nhave no CLASSPATH value.
