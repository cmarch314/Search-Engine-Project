MirrorPlus com The software industry has evolved at a very rapid pace in the last two decades Many architecures frameworks and platforms have served the changing appetite for developing innovative software products targeted for horizontal as well as vertical market segments With the increasing popularity of web based internet software solutions a whole new set of architectures tools and components have emerged Often it is very challenging as to what development deployment management and integration environment to embrace in order to support your architectural evolution There are at the minimum UNIX and Microsoft Windows camps The speaker will leverage his multi platform experience with the operating systems distributed systems management client server applications datawarehousing and the internet software to share valuable insights into the direction of distributed software development Biography Mr Tandon is the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of MirrorPlus Technologies a silicon valley Internet and E commerce software start up He has over 2 years of software engineering and senior management experience at well known computer and software companies including Hewlett Packard Amdahl Unison Software acquired by IBM and Prism Solutions acquired by Ardent Software He has successfully led the architecture design and development of several highly innovative systems software client server applications datawarehousing and Internet software projects Mr Tandon holds an M S in Computer Engineering from Case Western Reserve University Cleveland Ohio and an M Sc in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur India Practical Considerations for Deploying a Java Active Networking Platform Robert F Jaeger Network Researcher University of Maryland Nortel Networks rojaeger nortelnetworks com Active networks enable the introduction of user computing to network devices to provide new and improved services and distributed application functionality Traditional networks deliver packets between endpoints employing congestion control output queue scheduling and routing protocol software which is bundled with the hardware and does not support user customization or introduction of new software protocols We discuss the real world issues involved in safely and concurrently running multiple non interfering services on a Gigabit router using Java as the platform for network programming The Active Networking Working Group describes NodeOS a model for providing active nodes on a network with a resource manager to control the allocation of system resources such as memory CPU cycles persistent storage and access to IO bandwidth We discuss the difficuties of providing resource management within the Java framework Biography Robert F Jaeger received the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Cum Laude from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg VA He received an M S in Computer Science from the John Hopkins University in Baltimore MD and is writing his dissertation in the area of Active Networking at the University of Maryland College Park Since 1987 Mr Jaeger has been working with communications networks including controlling equipment remotely over HBIB simulating networks and building and verifying operation of ATM and high performance IP and Optical Networks His main areas of interest are networking and protocols He is currently involved in projects to provide QoS to IP networks including experimenting with IP Telephony The application of Active Networking is being investigated as well as how to build an active networking platform on which application services can be run Meeting Coordinator Sriram Sankar Metamata Inc sriram sankar metamata com Directions
