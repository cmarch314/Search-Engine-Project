We\r\ngive experimental results which indicate that on some types of constraint\r\nsatisfaction problems, full looking ahead outperforms forward checking.\r\nWe also present three new looking ahead algorithms, all variations on full\r\nlooking ahead, which were designed with the goal of achieving performance\r\nequal to the better of forward checking and full looking ahead on a variety of\r\nconstraint satisfaction problems. One of these new algorithms, called smart\r\nlooking ahead, comes close to achieving our goal.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"dan-CP96-full.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"dan-CP96-full.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8556.0}
