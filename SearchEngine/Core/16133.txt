the Web page occasionally to stay up to date Homework and Handouts The homework assignments are regularly posted on the Web Some homework problems may be difficult Homework that is turned in should be legible and well written A badly written poorly presented solution to a problem is of little value even if it happens to be correct The homework problems are an integral part of the course They complement the material covered in the lectures by providing examples applications and extensions You are strongly encouraged to attempt all problems Even if you cannot solve them if you have tried hard to solve them you may be more likely to understand and remember the solution Our brains learn something while attempting to solve a problem even and perhaps especially during failed attempts So do not get discouraged if a problem is difficult Discussion Section You must be registered for a discussion section The discussion section provides you with an opportunity to ask questions about the lecture material It is strongly recommended that you attend a discussion section regularly You are responsible for all material covered there 3 Course Policies back to top Late Assignments Homework assignments are due every Thursday by 3 PM in the distribution center Absolutely no homework assignments will be accepted after 3 PM If your homework is not turned by then you will receive a There will be a quiz given every Tuesday at the beginning of lecture The quiz will be handed out at 3 3 PM sharp and will be picked up at 3 45 PM sharp When we tabulate your final grade we will drop the two lowest quiz scores and the two lowest homework scores However in exchange for this we well make absolutely no allowances if you arrive at a quiz late or turn in your homework late This holds even if you have a perfectly valid reason to miss a homework assignment or a quiz If for some reason you fail to make it to a quiz or hand in a homework assignment that will count as one of your dropped quizzes or homework assignments no matter how legitimate your reason is Grading Only parts of the homework assignments will be graded However you will not know which particular problems will be graded before you hand in your assignment Questions on Grading For any questions regarding grades please contact the TA during his office hours or at the end of the discussion sections Collaboration You are allowed and even encouraged to discuss the solutions to the homework with your fellow classmates However you are required to sit down and write up your own solutions independently In addition you need to write down the names of any classmates with whom you have collaborated on a given assignment clearly indicating that they are your collaborators Copying the homework assignment of another student is considered cheating Keep in mind that the homework contributes little to your final grade in comparison to the quizzes Thus it is very much in your own best interest to have a thorough understanding of the homework assignments before the quiz Academic Honesty All work done on quizzes midterms and finals should be your own work Cheating on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously Any such incident will result in a letter describing the incident which is placed in your file on campus Depending on the severity of the incident the resulting grade can range from an F on the particular examination to an automatic F in the course Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the university Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or expulsion from the university ICS Change of Grade Option Policy The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to change their grade option is the end of 6th week with instructor s approval Dean s signature available at the ICS Student Affairs office will be required after the deadline and the ICS Student Affairs office does not allow a change of grade option for any course after 6th week unless the student has documented a medical or financial hardship ICS Add Deadline The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to add an ICS course is the end of 3rd week with instructor s approval Any course additions after the 3rd week of classes requires Dean s signature and careful review by the ICS Student Affairs office If you are adding a course after the 3rd week please go to the ICS Student Affairs office 4 List of Topics back to top The following list of topics is tentaive and subject to change Week 1 Logic 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 sets 1 6 Week 2 Set operations

in the midterm was unclearly stated I have decided to grant everyone the full point for that item irrespective of your answer By email and through the EEE system you can obtain the numeric score for your midterm You may now apply the figure below to read out your letter grade If you have a bonus point you may add one point to your score and then read out your letter grade from the figure Please understand that this letter grade is provided to give you an idea how you are performing Your final grade will be computed in a similar manner by combining all numeric scores over homeworks quizzes
