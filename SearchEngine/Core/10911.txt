{"text": "Sphere Packing and Kissing Numbers Problems of arranging balls densely arise in many situations particularly in coding theory the balls are formed by the sets of inputs that the error correction would map into a single codeword The most important question in this area is Kepler s problem what is the most dense packing of spheres in space The answer is obvious to anyone who has seen grapefruit stacked in a grocery store but a proof remains elusive It is known however that the usual grapefruit packing is the densest packing in which the sphere centers form a lattice The colorfully named kissing number problem refers to the local density of packings how many balls can touch another ball This can itself be viewed as a version of Kepler s problem for spherical rather than
