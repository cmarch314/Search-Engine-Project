For a set <i>P</i> of <i>n</i> moving points where the trajectory\nof each\npoint is an algebraic function of constant maximum degree <i>s</i>, our\nkinetic algorithm uses <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) space\nand <nobr><i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>)</nobr> preprocessing\ntime and processes\n<nobr><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> &beta;<sub>2<i>s</i> + 2</sub>(<i>n</i>)<sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>)</nobr>\nevents in amortized <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time per event, where\n&beta;<sub><i>s</i></sub>(<i>n</i>) is an\nextremely slow growing function. In terms of the KDS performance\ncriteria, our KDS is efficient, responsive (in an amortized sense),\ncompact, and local (on average).\n</p><p>\nOur deterministic kinetic algorithm improves by\nan <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<i>n</i>)\nfactor the previous randomized kinetic algorithm by Agarwal, Kaplan,\nand Sharir. The improvement is obtained by using a new sparse graph\nrepresentation, the Pie Delaunay graph, to reduce the problem to\none-dimensional range searching, as opposed to the two-dimensional\nrange searching in the previous work. Their KDS is efficient,\nresponsive (in an amortized sense), and compact, but it is not local.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based\non a paper by Z. Rahmati, V. King, and S.
