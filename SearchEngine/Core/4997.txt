In a world \r\nwhere several small computing devices communicate with each other and with \r\nhumans in a context-aware manner, the need for short-range, localized \r\ncommunications emerges as a critical issue. Devices that are nearby must take \r\nadvantage of the proximity, rather than overloading the links for long-distance \r\ncommunication. Short-range communication cannot be properly addressed by simply \r\nscaling down the existing communication networks. Efforts such as IrDA and \r\nBluetooth attest to that. We argue that sound will also play an important role \r\nin this new computing world.</p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This article revisits acoustic modems in the context of <i>\r\nubicomp </i>applications. In particular, it focuses on modems specifically \r\ndesigned for short-range, low bandwidth communications in air. The objectives of \r\nthe article are three-fold. First, we identify a class of applications within \r\nthe <i>ubicomp </i>paradigm that greatly benefit from such communication system, \r\nand identify human factors that the design of these modems must account for. \r\nSecond, we show how standard modulation techniques can be used to produce \r\ncommunication systems that account for those human factors, <i>i.e.</i>, in \r\nwhich the messages are musical and other familiar sounds. Finally, we \r\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our aerial acoustic modems with illustrative \r\nexamples.</p>\r\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This work lays out the ground work for an interdisciplinary \r\ncollaboration seldom seen in the desktop world: one where communications \r\nengineers and sound artists will work together. The modems described here are \r\nonly a hint of what can come next.</p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p><i>Appears in <a href=\"http://www.computer.org/pervasive/\">IEEE Pervasive \r\nComputing</a>.
