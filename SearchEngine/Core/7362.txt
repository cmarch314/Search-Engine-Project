Talks Information Sessions Sponsor Projects Leadership Council Corporate Partners Sponsor Interns Tech Jobs Butterworth Competition Bren school home Undergraduate policies Undergraduate Student Policies Academic Integrity Every student should be familiar with the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty This text is also duplicated in the appendix of the UCI General Catalogue The policies outlined for the campus also apply within the Bren School And if you are not familiar with UCI s Code of Student Conduct which is another aspect of academic integrity we would encourage you to also take the time to explore the website of the Office of Student Conduct Academically Honest Conduct To be academically integrous means holding to values such as honesty fairness respect and accountability in your scholastic pursuits Students are expected to follow the rules and guidelines established by instructors for assignments and exams and to accept responsibility for his or her own work Examples of academically honest conduct are Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course s staff instructor teaching assistant or reader Submission of one assignment for a group of students if group work is explicitly permitted or required Getting or giving help on how to operate the computer or terminal Getting or giving help on how to eliminate minor syntax errors High level discussion of course material for better comprehension Discussion of assignments with the instructor or TA to better understand what is being asked for Seeking help from course staff and or other campus resources if you do not understand the material or are feeling overwhelmed by your courseload Academically Dishonest Conduct Actions associated with academic dishonesty include cheating lying plagiarizing forging and stealing Examples of such behavior in the classroom are Turning in someone else s work as your own with or without his or her knowledge Submitting a completely duplicated assignment is a flagrant offense but even copying only a portion of the assignment and turning it in as your own is considered cheating Allowing someone else to turn in your work as his or her own Several people writing one program and turning in multiple copies all represented implicitly or explicitly as individual work Using any part of some else s work without proper acknowledgement This is plagiarism Stealing an examination or a solution from the instructor This is an extremely flagrant offense For instance an example of program plagiarism would be if an assignment that calls for independent development and implementation of a program assignment intent and specified ground rules results in two or more solutions so similar that one can be converted to another by a mechanical transformation Or cheating might be suspected if a student who was to complete an assignment independently cannot explain both the intricacies of his or her solution and the techniques used to generate that solution Any case in which academic dishonesty is suspected is given careful individual scrutiny The intent of an assignment the ground rules specified by the instructor and the behavior of the student are all factors considered before a decision is made In the event that an instructor writes a letter accusing a student of academic dishonesty the student may prepare a statement giving his or her side of the case for inclusion in the student s file Penalties of Academic Dishonesty A recorded incident of academic dishonesty may disqualify you for consideration for honors at graduation A first incident of academic dishonesty if egregious may be sufficient to cause suspension or dismissal from the University a second incident likely will result in suspension or dismissal An incident of academic dishonesty is sufficient to cause denial of a petition to change major into the Bren School An incident of academic dishonesty may be sufficient to cause denial of admission

Students are expected to follow the rules and guidelines established by instructors for assignments and exams, and to accept responsibility for his or her own work.  Examples of academically honest conduct are:</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning in\nwork done alone or with the help of the course's staff (instructor, teaching assistant, or reader).</li>\n<li>Submission of\none assignment for a group of students if group work is explicitly permitted\n(or required).</li>\n<li>Getting or\ngiving help on how to operate the computer or terminal.</li>\n<li>Getting or\ngiving help on how to eliminate minor syntax errors.</li>\n<li>High-level\ndiscussion of course material for better comprehension.</li>\n<li>Discussion of\nassignments with the instructor or TA to better understand what is being asked for.</li>\n<li>Seeking help from course staff and/or other campus resources if you do not understand the material or are feeling overwhelmed by your courseload.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #6699cc;\"><b>&#187;</b></span> Academically Dishonest Conduct</strong></p>\n<p>Actions associated with academic dishonesty include cheating, lying, plagiarizing, forging, and stealing. Examples of such behavior in the classroom are:</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning in\nsomeone else's work as your own (with <em>or</em> without his or her knowledge). Submitting a completely duplicated assignment is a flagrant offense, but even copying only\na portion of the assignment and turning it in as your own is considered\ncheating.</li>\n<li>Allowing\nsomeone else to turn in <em>your </em>work as his or her own.</li>\n<li>Several people\nwriting one program and turning in multiple copies, all represented (implicitly\nor explicitly) as individual work.</li>\n<li>Using <em>any </em>part\nof some else's work without proper acknowledgement. This is plagiarism.</li>\n<li>Stealing an\nexamination or a solution from the instructor. This is an extremely flagrant\noffense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, an\nexample of <strong>program plagiarism</strong> would be if an assignment that calls for independent development and implementation of a program\n(assignment intent and specified ground rules) results in two or more\nsolutions so similar that one can be converted to another by a mechanical\ntransformation. Or, <strong>cheating</strong> might be suspected if a student who was to complete an assignment independently cannot explain both the intricacies of his or her\nsolution and the techniques used to generate that solution.</p>\n<p>Any case in which academic dishonesty is suspected is given careful, individual scrutiny. The intent of an assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of the student are all factors considered before a decision is made.</p>\n<p><em>In the event that an instructor writes a\nletter accusing a student of academic dishonesty, the student may prepare a\nstatement giving his or her side of the case for inclusion in the student's file.</em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #6699cc;\"><strong>&#187;</strong></span> Penalties of Academic Dishonesty</strong></p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A recorded incident of academic\ndishonesty may disqualify you for consideration for honors at graduation.</li>\n<li>A first incident of academic dishonesty\n(if egregious) may be sufficient to cause suspension or dismissal from the\nUniversity; a second incident likely will result in suspension or dismissal.</li>\n<li>An incident of academic dishonesty is\nsufficient to cause denial of a petition to change major into the Bren School.</li>\n<li>An incident of academic dishonesty may\nbe sufficient to cause denial of admission into the Bren School Honors Program.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"><div id=\"sidebar_title\">More Undergraduate &#187;</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../sao/index.php\">Academic advising</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../courses/index.php\">Academic year plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../QA_Petitions.php\">Petitions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/index.php\">ICS majors</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/Double_Majors.php\">Double major</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/Second_BA.php\">2nd baccalaureate</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/Minors.php\">ICS minors</a></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 70%; font-weight: bold;\">Policies</span>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"Academic_Integrity.php\">Academic integrity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Academic_Standing.php\">Academic standing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Add_Drop_ChangeOption.php\">Add, drop, &amp; change options</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Course_Outside_UCI.php\">Coursework outside UCI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Grade_Options.php\">Grade policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Laptop_ComputerUse.php\">Laptop &amp; computer use</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Withdrawal_Readmission.php\">Withdrawal/Readmission</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"../QA_Graduation.php\">Graduation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../resources/index.php\">ICS student life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../computing/account/new.php\">Computing support</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a> |\n   \n   <!-- <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/sitemap.php\">Site Map</a> | -->\n \n  <a href=\"mailto: i%63%73%77%65%62m%61s%74%65r@%69c%73%2e%75c%69%2eedu\">icswebmaster</a> |\nUpdated: \nJuly 29 2014</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 7362.0}
