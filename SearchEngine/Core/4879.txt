Raw input about\r\nunfolding events may arrive from variety of sources in the form of\r\nsensor data, video streams, human observations, and so on, from\r\nwhich events of interest are extracted. Location is one of the\r\nmost important attributes of events, useful for a variety of SA\r\ntasks. In this article, we consider the problem of reaching\r\nsituation awareness from textual input. We propose an approach to\r\nprobabilistically model and represent (potentially uncertain)\r\nevent locations described by human reporters in the form of free\r\ntext. We analyze several types of spatial queries of interest in\r\nSA applications. We design techniques to store and index the uncertain locations, to support the efficient processing of queries. Our extensive experimental evaluation over real and synthetic datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Categories and Subject Descriptors:</H3>\r\nH.2.8 [<B>Information System</B>]: Database Management\ufffdSpatial databases and GIS\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3>\r\nLocation Disambiguation, Uncertain Location Modeling, Probabilistic Indexing, Probabilistic Representation, Histogram Compression.\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\n<!-- <font color=red> Downloads of the drafts are temporarily disabled.</font><BR>  -->\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/TKDE08_dvk_SAT.pdf\">TKDE08_dvk_SAT.pdf</A><BR>\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?TKDE08_dvk_SAT\" width=1 height=1>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@article{TKDE08::dvk_SAT,\r\n   author    = {Yiming Ma and Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Sharad Mehrotra},\r\n   title     = {Towards Managing Uncertain Spatial Information for Situational Awareness Applications},\r\n   journal   = {{IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (IEEE TKDE)}},\r\n   year      = 2008,\r\n   volume    = 20,\r\n   number    = 10,\r\n   month     = oct,\r\n   year      = 2008\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n</html>", "id": 4879.0}
