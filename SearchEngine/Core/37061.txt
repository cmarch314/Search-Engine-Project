indicates that it is \r\nintegrated in the \r\ncomputer-aided drug design toolkit, X-Tool, which is being developed by Dr. Renxiao Wang.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>X-Score is a &quot;scoring function&quot;, which has its major applications to \r\nstructure-based drug design studies. It computes a binding score for a given \r\nprotein-ligand complex structure, and this binding score correlates to \r\nexperimental binding constants well. Three individual empirical scoring functions have been implemented\r\nin this program, which are named as <b><font color=\"#0000FF\">HPScore</font></b>,\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"><b>HMScore</b></font>, and <font color=\"#0000FF\"> <b>HSScore, </b></font>\r\nrespectively. They can be conceptually written as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <font color=\"#0000FF\"> <strong>HPScore</strong> </font>= C<sub>0,1</sub> + C<sub>VDW,1</sub>*(VDW) + \r\nC<sub>HB,1</sub>*(H-Bond) + C<sub>HP</sub>*(Hydrophobic Pair) + C<sub>RT,1</sub>*(Rotor)</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <strong><font color=\"#0000FF\">HMScore</font></strong> = C<sub>0,2</sub> + C<sub>VDW,2</sub>*(VDW) + \r\nC<sub>HB,2</sub>*(H-Bond) + C<sub>HM</sub>*(Hydrophobic\r\nMatch) + C<sub>RT,2</sub>*(Rotor)</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <font color=\"#0000FF\"><strong>HSScore</strong></font> = C<sub>0,3</sub> + C<sub>VDW,3</sub>*(VDW) + \r\nC<sub>HB,3</sub>*(H-Bond) + C<sub>HS</sub>*(Hydrophobic\r\nsurface) + C<sub>RT,3</sub>*(Rotor)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By default, the final results:\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <strong>\r\nX-Score</strong></font><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = (</strong><strong><font color=\"#0000FF\">HP</font></strong><font color=\"#0000FF\"><strong>Score</strong></font><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> + </strong>\r\n<strong><font color=\"#0000FF\">HMScore</font></strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> + </strong>\r\n<strong><font color=\"#0000FF\">HS</font></strong><font color=\"#0000FF\"><strong>Score</strong></font><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\">) / 3. \r\nHowever, the users are allowed to choose any combination of the above three \r\nscoring functions to meet their own interests.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\">All of these scoring functions  </strong>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>w</strong>ere originally</span> \r\ncalibrated with a set of 200 diverse protein-ligand complexes, and \r\nthey were able to reproduce the binding constants of the entire set \r\nwith an average accuracy of 1.5 log units (corresponding to ~ 2 kcal/mol \r\nin terms of binding free energy). For more detailed description of X-Score, \r\nplease check the reference given below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Since X-Score does not perform molecular docking by itself, \r\nit is typically applied in combination with a molecular \r\ndocking program, such as DOCK, AutoDock, FlexX or GOLD, in structure-base drug \r\ndesign studies. The molecular docking program is used to provide the binding \r\nmodels of the molecules of interests to their target protein. Then, X-Score can \r\nbe applied to re-rank them and give more accurate estimation of the binding free \r\nenergies of these molecules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The correct way to refer this program is X-Score.&nbsp;Note that X-Score was formerly known as X-CScore \r\nfor a short while. Please stop using the name of X-CScore to avoid further \r\nconfusion.

They are allowed to adjust the coefficients \r\n  before each term in the scoring functions to emphasize  or underscore certain \r\n  type of interactions between the protein and the ligand molecules if this is \r\n  necessary for the success of their projects.</li>\r\n  <li>More detailed outputs are available, which tabulate the role \r\n  of each atom in binding score computation. This \r\n  information  helps users to analyze the structure-affinity relationship of the \r\n  ligand molecules under study in a more transparent manner.</li>\r\n  <li>New utilities have been added to aid users to prepare the input structures more conveniently and more accurately.</li>\r\n  <li>Some bugs found in the previous version have been fixed. Many parts of the \r\n  program have been optimized to give better performance. </li>\r\n  <li>The user manual has  been largely rewritten to reflect the many changes in \r\n  version 1.2.
