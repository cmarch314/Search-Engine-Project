In case\nof data loss, the client can be compensated with a dollar amount proportional to the\ndamage that has occurred. Our technique is based on an extension of invertible Bloom\nfilters, a data structure used to quickly compute the distance between two sets. Also, we\nshow how our protocol can be integrated with Bitcoin to support an automatic compensation\nscheme.\n<p>\nJoint work with Giuseppe Ateniese, Michael T.
