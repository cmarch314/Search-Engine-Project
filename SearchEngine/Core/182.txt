competitions reward the best in both hardware and software To the naked eye this year s Butterworth Product Development Competition at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences looked much as it always has All throughout the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology Calit2 in late May teams of earnest students under the watchful eye of their industry faculty and alumni mentors gave impassioned presentations about their innovative projects to a panel of distinguished judges with the results announced at a festive gathering that evening But if you d been to previous installments of the contest you might have sensed that there were perhaps more snappily dressed students around Well there were roughly twice as many The 11th annual Butterworth development competition was also the inaugural year for the Beall Student Design Competition The Butterworth competition is named for and generously supported by Bren School alumnus Paul Butterworth B S 74 M S 81 chief technical officer of AccessG2 Inc The Beall competition is made possible by the generosity of the Beall Family Foundation Where Butterworth emphasizes software and requires that at least one team member be from ICS Beall focuses on hardware and requires that least one team member be from the Samueli School of Engineering The two competitions were not only concurrent and complementary they also overlapped Several teams entered their projects in both competitions There was also more prize money at stake a total of 3 between the Butterworth and Beall contests Here are the teams who took home the prizes Butterworth Product Development Competition Winners Blueberry since renamed Sparky First Place 7 5 The app its creators now call Sparky is a networking tool Turning on the app on a smartphone creates a 1 foot Bluetooth bubble around the person Whenever one Sparky bubble encounters another a silent connection is created Throughout the day the app monitors interactions collecting metadata like time location and duration The profile pages and interaction metadata the app offers are so comprehensive that the need to take notes is all but eliminated Once professionals are ready to follow up Sparky presents them with an intelligently sorted list of everybody they interacted with at an event Team Sparky Karan Sekhri Adrien Deguzman Sheng

ICS director strategic planning Boeing Beall Student Design Competition Winners Spero Diagnostics First Place 7 5 This product addresses the dangerous even deadly prevalence of sepsis in hospital settings Today a full sepsis diagnostic process takes up to four days requires multiple tests advanced trained personnel and costs several hundred dollars Spero Diagnostics goal was to reduce that time frame to less than three hours and bring the cost down to under 1 Their design is a software package that automates a device that performs complicated diagnostic tests and reduces the volumes of reagents and samples The design also includes pre filled blister packs that both store and dispense all the appropriate reagents and volumes needed to perform tests The automated device and blister packs will allow a minimally trained user to perform complicated sepsis diagnostic tests at the point of care Team Spero Diagnostics Jessica Motherwell Jose Gallegos Ernesto Sosa Ting Yi Chu Maka

All throughout the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) in late May, teams of earnest students, under the watchful eye of their industry, faculty and alumni mentors, gave impassioned presentations about their innovative projects to a panel of distinguished judges, with the results announced at a festive gathering that evening.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut if you&#8217;d been to previous installments of the contest, you might have sensed that there were perhaps more snappily dressed students around. Well, there were &#8211; roughly twice as many. The 11th annual Butterworth development competition was also the inaugural year for the Beall Student Design Competition.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Butterworth competition is named for, and generously supported by, Bren School alumnus Paul Butterworth (B.S. &#8217;74, M.S. &#8217;81), chief technical officer of AccessG2 Inc. The Beall competition is made possible by the generosity of the Beall Family Foundation.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhere Butterworth emphasizes software, and requires that at least one team member be from ICS, Beall focuses on hardware, and requires that least one team member be from the Samueli School of Engineering. The two competitions were not only concurrent and complementary, they also overlapped: Several teams entered their projects in both competitions.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was also more prize money at stake &#8211; a total of $30,000 between the Butterworth and Beall contests. Here are the teams who took home the prizes.\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n</p>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<h3>Butterworth Product Development Competition Winners</h3>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>\n<b>&#8220;Blueberry&#8221; (since renamed &#8220;Sparky&#8221;) <br/>\nFirst Place ($7,500) </b>\n</p>\n<img alt=\"Blueberry/Sparky\" class=\"wrapped_image right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/events/butterworth_beall_2014/blueberry.jpg\"/>\nThe app its creators now call &#8220;Sparky&#8221; is a networking tool. Turning on the app on a smartphone creates a 10-foot Bluetooth bubble around the person. Whenever one &#8220;Sparky&#8221; bubble encounters another, a silent connection is created. Throughout the day, the app monitors interactions collecting metadata like time, location, and duration. The profile pages and interaction metadata the app offers are so comprehensive that the need to take notes is all but eliminated. Once professionals are ready to follow up, &#8220;Sparky&#8221; presents them with an intelligently sorted list of everybody they interacted with at an event.\n<p>\n<b>Team Sparky:</b> Karan Sekhri, Adrien Deguzman, Sheng Xia, Tai Cao, Derek Omuro.

Every device that has a &#8220;BeatPool&#8221; app on it can send songs from its own library into collaborative pool. The system is structured in a way that allows it to function either in crowded environments such as parties, or even on camping trips.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Team Sprout:</b> Ekin Oguz, Sky Faber, Cesar Ghali, Fulya Ozcan.

It serves as a platform where advertisers of events, such as student organizations and school departments, can meet the seekers of event information, the audience. By allowing users to filter through events and subscribe to groups and categories of interest, &#8220;Ant-mApp&#8221; will enhance the community involvement and learning experience of UCI students. &#8220;Ant-mApp&#8221; is a sustainable alternative to flyering intended to grow and strengthen the bonds of members of the UCI community.\n<p>\n<b>Team Ant-mApp:</b> Alexsandra Guerra, Esosa Agbonwaneten, <span>Yerlan Turekeshov</span>, Avedis Simonian, Maharshi Patel.

Today, a full sepsis diagnostic process takes up to four days, requires multiple tests, advanced trained personnel, and costs several hundred dollars. Spero Diagnostics&#8217; goal was to reduce that time frame to less than three hours and bring the cost down to under $100. Their design is a software package that automates a device that performs complicated diagnostic tests and reduces the volumes of reagents and samples. The design also includes pre-filled blister packs that both store and dispense all the appropriate reagents and volumes needed to perform tests. The automated device and blister packs will allow a minimally trained user to perform complicated sepsis diagnostic tests at the point of care.\n<p>\n<b>Team Spero Diagnostics:</b> Jessica Motherwell, Jose Gallegos, Ernesto Sosa, Ting-Yi Chu, Maka Pennell, Zachary Campagna.

The products take the latest discoveries in science and use current engineering methodologies to create an educational toolbox, tailored to children of all ages. The Inventor&#8217;s Toolboxes encourage children to explore, create, and invent by allowing them to build their own structures and models. The simple design of these three Inventor&#8217;s Toolboxes makes even the most cutting edge scientific technologies easy enough for any child or parent to learn. The team&#8217;s goal and vision is to create and foster an online community of young inventors able to interact and share with one another, similar to scientists in real life.\n<p>\n<b>Team A Hundred Tiny Hands:</b> Sophia Lin, Nicole Mendoza, Jolie McLane, Eugene Lee, Danny Greene.
