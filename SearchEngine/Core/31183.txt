Most clustering algorithms scale either linearly or\nquadratically in the size of a data set. Thus, the run-times for\nclustering methods can become burdensome when using large data sets.\nMeek, Thiesson, and Heckerman (2001) provide a method for selecting\nthe number of points to use during the construction of a clustering\nmodel and demonstrate the method can lead to substantial speedups\nwhile obtaining clusters with comparable predictive power. Their\nanalysis is performed on several data sets including the\n<A href=\"USCensus1990.html\">USCensus1990</a> data set.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMeek, Thiesson, and Heckerman (2001), \"The Learning Curve Method\nApplied to Clustering\", to appear in The Journal of Machine Learning\nResearch.
