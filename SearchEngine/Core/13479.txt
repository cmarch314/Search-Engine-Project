An input to this problem consists\nof a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must\nbe grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at\nleast the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/anonymity.ppt\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"auth.html\">Co-authors</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
