The two-state \ncase in which there is a single active and a single sleep state is a \ncontinuous version of the ski-rental problem. We consider a generalized \nversion in which there is more than one sleep state, each with its own \npower consumption rate and transition costs. We give an algorithm that, \ngiven a system, produces a deterministic strategy whose competitive \nratio is arbitrarily close to optimal. We also give an algorithm to \nproduce the optimal online strategy given a system and a probability \ndistribution that generates the length of the idle period. We also give \na simple algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 5.828 for any \nsystem.\n\n<p>\nFrom: Optimal Power-Down Strategies by John Augustine, Sandy Irani, and \nChaitanya Swamy.
