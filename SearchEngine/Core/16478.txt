The open source movement has generated an extremely large body of code,\nwhich presents a tremendous opportunity to software engineering researchers. Not only do we leverage this code for our own research, but we\nprovide the open source <span class=\"emph\">Sourcerer Infrastructure</span> for other researchers to use.</p>\n\n<h2>Sourcerer Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The Sourcerer Infrastructure is composed of a number of layers.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"infrastructure.html\">Core Infrastructure</a></h3>\n<p class=\"sub\">At the lowest layer, the <a href=\"infrastructure.html\">core infrastructure</a> is a set of Java tools for crawling, \ndownloading, processing and indexing open source Java projects. It is available on \n<a href=\"http://github.com/sourcerer/Sourcerer/\">GitHub</a> under a GNU GPL license. \n</p>\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"repository.html\">Repository</a></h3>\n<p class=\"sub\">While the core infrastructure allows one to automatically crawl and download open source projects,\nwe also provide our current repository to anyone interested. More information can be found on the\n<a href=\"repository.html\">repository</a> page.\n\n<h3><a href=\"sourcerer-db.html\">Sourcerer DB</a></h3>\n<p class=\"sub\">Once Sourcerer's repository is constructed, we populate <a href=\"sourcerer-db.html\">Sourcerer DB</a>,\na relational database, with structure and reference information extracted from the project source code.\nThe services that the Sourcerer Infrastructure provides, including the code search service, are all built on\ntop of Sourcerer DB. We provide direct read-only access to Sourcerer DB to those that are interested.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"services.html\">Services</a></h3>\n<p class=\"sub\">The Sourcerer Infrastructure provides a number of higher-level services that researchers or \napplication designers can leverage to create rich next-generation search applications. These services\ninclude repository exploration, code search and dependency slicing.\n\n<h3><a href=\"code-search-engine.html\">Code Search Engine</a></h3>\n<p class=\"sub\">The first application we built using the Sourcerer Infrastructure was a code search engine. A running\nversion of the search engine can be found <a href=\"http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/search/index.jsp\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<!--<h3><a href=\"code-genie.html\">CodeGenie</a></h3>\n<p>CodeGenie, an Eclipse plug-in for test-driven code search, was also constructed using the Sourcerer\nInfrastructure.</p> -->\n\n<!--<h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>Funding for the <span class=\"emph\">Sourcerer Project</span> has been provided by...</p> -->\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"navbar\">\n  <div><a class=\"sel\" href=\"index.html\">Overview</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"infrastructure.html\">Core Infrastructure</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"repository.html\">Repository</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"sourcerer-db.html\">SourcererDB</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"services.html\">Services</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"code-search-engine.html\">Code Search Engine</a></div>\n  <!--<div><a href=\"code-genie.html\">CodeGenie</a></div> -->\n  <div><a href=\"tutorial.html\">Tutorial</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"people.html\">People</a></div>\n  <div><a href=\"publications.html\">Publications</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 16478.0}
