{"text": "R Lab 4 Assignment It will help to review the Nov 19 discussion on expectations and life tables before attempting this lab assignment Instructions This is a pair programming assignment so find a partner to work with at the beginning of discussion You must work with a different partner than the partner you worked with for R Lab 1 R Lab 2 or R Lab 3 You will turn in one lab assignment between the two of you and both of you will receive the same score Use one laptop between the two of you and take turns being the driver and the navigator If there are an odd number of students in discussion or you cannot find a partner see your TA If you do not attend discussion you must find a partner to work with outside of class The TA will pass around a lab attendance sheet on which you should write your name and your partner s name You must submit your lab assignment through the EEE Dropbox tool following the instructions found here A separate dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments This lab assignment is due Wednesday Dec 1 by 11am You must include all relevant R code used to answer the questions Partner evaluation forms will be available online via EEE Survey after completing and turning in the lab assignment Filling out the partner evaluation form is required of each student submitting a lab assignment Evaluations will be kept confidential your partner will never see what you wrote in your evaluation Part 1 U S Life Expectancy Use the Life97 life table from the life tables discussion to answer the following three questions Compute the life expectancy mean length of life based on the Life97 tables for both males and females using the age midpoints age 1 119 1 2 Find the median length of life for both males and females and compare the mean length of life to the median length of life for each group Hint you can figure out the median by examination of the original life table The median age is not 59 5 What proportion of each sex survives past age 2 age 5 age 8 Compute the conditional life expectancy for both males and females given survival to age 2 age 5 and age 8 Part 2 Life Expectancy in Afghanistan Life expectation varies from group to group For a dramatically different population load the life tables for Afghanistan over the same time period using the R command AfghanLife read table http www ics uci edu staceyah 12 A Afghan dat header TRUE This table is much less detailed with age of death in 5 year increments Use this table to answer the following question Compute the life expectancy based on the AfghanLife tables for both males and females again using age midpoints You can create a vector of age midpoints for this population using the command Afg age c 5 3 seq 7 5 1 2 5 by 5 Make sure you understand what the R code above is doing Compute the conditional life expectancy for both males and females given survival to age 2 age 5 and age 8 How to the unconditional and conditional life expectancies compare between the U S and Afghan populations How do the differences between males and females compare between the two populations Part 3 Conditional vs Unconditional Expectation A few years ago a New York Times article reported that 37 well known male symphony directors had an average life span about 5 years greater than the average for US males Speculation revolved around life style differences symphony directors wave their arms about while directing that must be good exercise and possible genetic explanations Is there a simple statistical explanation connected to conditional expectation Explain This has nothing to do with R just think about what we mean by conditional expectation versus unconditional expectation This lab as well as the expectation and life expectancy pages the lab is based off of were modified from the original by Albyn Jones Math 141 Reed College Stats 12 A Index", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~staceyah/120A/labs/Lab4.html", "title": "lab 4: assignment", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta content=\"text/html;
