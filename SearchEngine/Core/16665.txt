{"text": "Chimera ArchivesFebruary April 1997 Home What s New Archives 2 97 to 4 97 April 22 1997 Two major changes made to the 2 alpha release 5 PM PST Switched to using buffered network i o This simple change resulted in a 4x increase in performance Our average message roundtrip was about 11 milliseconds previous to this change It is now 25 milliseconds Switched to using a hand written file database rather than continue to use the Java Object Persistence mechanism Thus JOP is now longer needed to use Chimera 2 In the future we may switch to using Java s Object Serialization That switch will have to wait until the beta version when we switch to JDK 1 1 this summer Because of this change you will have to recreate any hyperwebs that you have constructed with former alpha versions of Chimera 2 If this is a problem contact Ken Anderson kanderso ics uci edu for help with converting the old webs to the new format It is highly recommended that you download the latest version of the alpha release from the software page April 15 1997 Very minor change to the source code of the 2 alpha release 1 25 AM PST Removed references to JOP persist PersistableArray from viewer JOP java and link JOP java If you have downloaded the source code release prior to this day be sure to delete the import JOP persist PersistableArray statements from these two files You may have problems compiling the release otherwise April 14 1997 Updated the Test Installation instructions 4 14 PM PST The instructions for verifying the installation of Chimera contained two errors The instructions have been updated to remove these errors In particular an environment variable for the hyperwebManager was incorrectly specified and the instructions failed to specify how to add machine names to the Servers panel of the Chimera server Updated the Step by Step installation instructions 4 4 PM PST Instructions were added to specify the correct use of the chimeraJOP zip file Added Chimera JOP Class Files to the software page 3 5 PM PST Several key files with respect to the Java Object Persistence system were left out of the chimera2 a zip file As a result those users who use the chimera2 a zip file directly instead of compiling the source code will have the hyperweb server fail when trying to write its hyperwebs The solution to the problem is to download the chimeraJOP zip file and unpack it in JOP s persistmarshall class directory This will enable the JOP to function correctly when trying to write Chimera related information into a database See the Installation Instructions for more details March 6 1997 Small update made to the released source code and class files 12 PM PST Another minor update has been made to the 2 alpha release In particular a dependence was removed on a library not listed on the Before you Install page This could cause problems when trying to compile the source code or using the class files since the referenced library would not be available If you downloaded the source and class archives from the Software page before March 6 12 PM PST be sure to update your copy March 3 1997 Small update made to the released source code and class files 4 3 PM PST A very small change has been made to the source code archives and class file archive that was released on February 28th In particular the files hwmunixInvoker java and hwmunixInvoker class were replaced If you downloaded the source and class archives from the Software page before March 3 4 3 PM PST be sure to update your copy The problem prevented the hyperwebManager from automatically invoking the hyperwebServer and chimeraServer The fix now allows this auto invocation to take place February 28 1997 Chimera 2 site goes on line This is the alpha release of Chimera 2 Not all features have been implemented Not all bugs have been squashed This web site is also at the alpha level Not all pages have been written ", "_id": "http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/chimera/archive/020497.html", "title":
