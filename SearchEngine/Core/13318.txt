As a\nconsequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane\nwith each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise-linear curve with\nat most two bends. In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a\nlinear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"auth.html\">Co-authors</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
