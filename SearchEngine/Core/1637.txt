While most of the results concern\narrangements in the projective plane, this paper presents the results on\nthe number of triangles in Euclidean arrangements of pseudolines. It\npresents another proof by the authors that a simple arrangement of n\npseudolines contains at least n-2 triangles. The best possible bound of\n2n/3 triangles in non-simple arrangements of n pseudolines is also\npresented in this paper.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 1637.0}
