For an arbitrary\ndual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of\norientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a\nrectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The\nalgorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a\ngiven dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's\nrepresentation theorem for distributive lattices.\n<p>\nMerged with \"<a href=\"p-area-universal.html\">Area-universal rectangular layouts</a>\"\nto form the journal version, \"<a href=\"p-aucrl.html\">Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts</a>\".\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/cartograms.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Combinatorics and geometry of finite and infinite squaregraphs</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/bandelt/\">H.-J.
