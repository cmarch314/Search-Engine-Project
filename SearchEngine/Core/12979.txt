The time to construct this graph\nis near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to\napproximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the\nsame time bound.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"jour.html\">Journals</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
