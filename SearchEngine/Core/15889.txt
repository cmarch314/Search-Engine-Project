{"text": "Project Proposals Written Proposals due in class Monday January 27thCS 277 Data Mining Winter 2 14 Proposals should be relatively brief but informative About 3 well written pages should be sufficient Project proposals will be graded like a homework assignment and receive a weight of 1 of your overall grade Proposals will be graded on clarity is it clear what will be done in this project and completeness is the proposal well thought out does it address all of the important aspects of the proposed project Project teams are allowed up to 3 people or you can work on your own Only one project proposal should be submitted per project include all team member names all team members will get the same grade for the proposal Your proposal will be reviewed and you will receive one of 3 responses 1 approved without any changes 2 approved with minor suggestions for changes 3 major revision required Typically most if not all proposals are in categories 1 or 2 You may begin work on your project after submittal but be aware that you may get feedback from me after your proposal is submitted within a week or so See project guidelines from the class Web page for suggestions on possible projects and data sets Note that your project plan your plan of what you will do will very likely change during the quarter as you learn more about the data this is fine as long as your overall goal the task you are addressing the data set you are using remains generally the same so no need to let me know about such changes However if during the quarter your project changes in a major way from what you proposed then you need to let me know email is fine Suggested Outline and Contents for your Proposal Project Definition provide a clear description of the problem you plan to address Motivation briefly explain why this problem is worth addressing eg addresses an important open research question tackles an important practical application etc Background provide a brief summary of what is known in the literature about this problem Provide at least 2 or 3 relevant references if you can At this early stage of your project proposal I don t expect a full literature review but will expect this by the time of the final report but you should have some idea of what is known in the literature about your proposed project for example try to make sure that your project has not already been done published earlier Data sets briefly describe the data set or sets that you will use in your project see the list of data sets recommended under the Project Guidelines page A brief description is fine since these data sets are already described elsewhere on the class Web pages If the data set is not on the list on the Web page then you will need to describe your proposed data set in more detail and provide some rationale as to why you are choosing this data set Software describe what algorithms and software you plan to use in your project Algorithms that you will develop yourself if so sketch out how you think these algorithms will work or at least your current ideas Algorithms that have already been published and implemented if so provide brief descriptions and references If you plan to use someone else s implementation in software provide references and details to the extent that you can Evaluation method you need to define how you will evaluate measure test your results or technique For prediction problems such as classification or regression this is typically straightforward since techniques such as out of sample accuracy are well defined and a good indicator of your method For techniques such as clustering or pattern finding it is not so clear how to measure success you might for example try a clustering algorithm on a data set where the class labels are known but you remove them and see if the algorithm can recover them For such problems you may want to look in the literature to see what evaluation techniques are typically used For a visualization project for example you might want to have human users use your system and generate subjective evaluations e g comparing your method with a baseline approach in a blind manner where the testers do not know which is baseline and which is the new method Milestones and Plan sketch out what you think will be the major intermediate milestones that you will need to achieve e g for each progress report and for the final report A bulleted list would be fine You don t need to include every small detail but give a general idea of what you plan to be doing for the next 6 or 7 weeks And of course this plan may change as you learn more about the data and the algorithms Feel free to identify potential risks in your proposal i e items that might cause delay or problems ", "_id":
