The Web encourages open, decentralized systems \nthat span multiple administrative domains. Trust Management is an emerging \nframework for decentralizing security decisions that helps developers and \nothers in asking \"why\" trust is granted rather than immediately focusing \non \"how\" cryptography can enforce it. This talk introduces the fundamental \nprinciples, principals, and policies of Trust Management, as well as Web-\nspecific pragmatic issues. [This work was originally presented in the \nWorld Wide Web Journal, First Monday, and the National Research Council \nComputer Science and Telecommunication Board's Information Systems\nTrustworthiness committee.

He was previously on the \ntechnical staff of the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT, where he focused \non security and electronic commerce issues. He has been involved in the \ndevelopment of cryptographic software tools and Web-related standards \ndevelopment. Rohit received a B.S. in Engineering and Applied Science \nand in Economics from the California Institute of Technology in 1995. \n\n<p>\n\n<EM><strong><font size=+1>Validating the Net: an Internet-scale Certificate Validation Service</em></strong></em><br>\n\nAmbarish Malpani, Founder and Lead Architect, <a href=\"http://www.valicert.com/\">Valicert</a>,\n<a href=\"mailto:ambarish@valicert.com\">ambarish@valicert.com</a>\n</font>\n\n<p>\n\nValiCert's universal approach addresses potentially debilitating \nperformance and compatibility problems related to certificate validation. \nA key component of the ValiCert solution is its high performance \nCertificate Revocation Tree (CRT) technology, which allows validation \nof digital certificates without downloading the entire global revocation \nlist. This approach scales easily to accommodate hundreds of billions of \ncertificates without creating an undue burden on the client requesting \nvalidation information. The result: vastly improved performance compared \nto earlier mechanisms, such as Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography:</strong>\nAmbarish Malpani is ValiCert's first employee and joined the \ncompany with over ten years of industry experience as a systems designer \nand architect. Most recently, Ambarish was a consultant specializing in \ncryptography and Internet applications. Ambarish holds an M.S. degree \nfrom the University of California at Santa Barbara and a B.S. degree from \nthe Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Coordinator:</strong> Richard N.
