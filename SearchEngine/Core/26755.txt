Pointcast satish pointcast com PointCast Inc the inventor and leader in broadcast news via the Internet and corporate intranets delivers news as it happens from leading sources such as CNN and the New York Times directly to a viewer s computer screen The PointCast Network is an integrated client server system which gives users control of selecting kinds of information the client retrieves and the frequency of those retrievals PointCast Client runs on the user s computer and retrieves information from the Central Broadcasting Facility which is composed of multiple sites geographically distributed over the US each carrying a number of web servers called PointServers PointServers are highly customized and infinitely scalable to serve close to 2 million requests in a day The PointCast Network receives content from about 6 different sources via satellite links or the internet A cluster of servers runs customized processes round the clock to assimilate data from various sources This presentation will describe the basic plumbing of the PointCast Network including fault tolerance load balancing achieving scalability through pre caching on servers packaging information to optimize internet bandwidth usage minimizing data latency Biography Satish Ramakrishnan is Senior Director of Software Development and Director of Server Engineering for Pointcast Inc Coordinator Patricia
