But I suspect we'll want to look at an additional HTTP method --\n&gt; call it SET_CONFIG -- to tell a server, \"Now switch to serving the\n&gt; 'tables-no-frames' version of the pages.\"\n\nKeith, I would suggest that the idea is appropriate, but the\nexample is ill-chosen.  The \"tables-no-frames\" version of the\npages would, presumably, be selected by the server based on the\ncontent negotiation.  More appropriate, especially for\ninformation providers (like <a href=\"http://www.economist.com\">http://www.economist.com</a>), would be a\nway to tell the server to \"let me browse the May 4 edition of the\nsite\".  Whether we ever get to that level or not remains to be\nseen.\n\nAnd, to emphasize, I don't consider the URL decorations to be\nnothing more than an easy way to generate links to old revisions\nof individual files.  However, such an ability is, I think, a\ncritical component of any larger system and clearly something\nwell-defined that we can start with before moving on to the more\ncontentious issues.\n\n- David\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0012.html\">Keith Dawson: \"Versions and configurations\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0010.html\">David J.
