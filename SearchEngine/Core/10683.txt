{"text": "Triangles and Simplices These pointers discuss triangles and their higher dimensional generalizations simplices I am particularly interested in triangulation by which I mean partitioning regions into triangles tetrahedra or higher dimensional simplices for various applications including finite element mesh generation and surface interpolation The other meaning of triangulation

the densest packing of equilateral triangles in the pattern of a square lattice There is only one parameter to optimize the angle of the triangle to the lattice vectors my answer is that the densest packing occurs when this angle is 15 or 45 degrees shown below If the lattice doesn t have to be square it is possible to get density 2 3 apparently this was long known e g see F ry Bull Soc Math France 78 195 152 Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least one point of the integer lattice or equivalently a triangle such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice they always cover the plane my guess is that the worst angle is parallel and 3 degrees to the lattice giving a triangle with 2 unit sides and contradicting an
