{"text": "The Miller Family Broken Miller Branches The following is a list of Miller branches and in some cases just leaves that have fallen from our tree They are known to be related but in most cases the exact connection is no longer known Korotichi Belarus M ller s Meller s from South America Pesach Dovid Friedman from Bardejov Mueller s from Strzyzow Lezajsk Galicia Kahan from Sighet Family in Lvov Lemberg Galicia Brand Family Izak Leib Muller of Ganichi Rumania Other members of the Shabsi Miller family Miller s Greenberg s from Lebeach Galicia Tziporah Miller Two Other Pesach Dovid s One Pesach Dovid not in our tree Miller Keller Rebhun connection from Nowy Sacz area A Miller branch is from Belarus Samuel M ller was born in Korotichi Belarus on March 23 1897 Korotichi was a very small town It is 1 1 kilometers East of Pinsk He married Chaya Weinreb of Erfurt Germany They lived in Cologne Germany where they raised a family They were last known to have been in Gorlice Poland during the war They never returned Chaskel Stengal gave me their pictures He took the pictures from the police station in Gorlice right after the war I have written to Korotichi and Cologne The officials at Cologne said there were no records of the M ller s The Korotichi archives are in Minsk They wanted an awful lot of money just to see if they had any records from 1897 I have not pursued this further at this time According to some family members Avrohm Abba Miller maintained that the famous cardiologist Jose Meller was related to us I went to visit Dr Meller in the summer of 1994 He was kind enough to see me in his office He related that his family was from Zebrecen Galicia His father Tzvi Elimelech a common name in our family was born in 19 5 and married Matil Bok His parents were Pinchus Rose The majority of the family currently resides in Santiago Chile Dr Meller has a nephew there Alan who did some work on a family tree I have not been able to solicit a response from him Pesach Dovid is a unique name particular to the Miller family The bearers of the name all have the namesake of Pesach Dovid Miller In addition a large part of the family lived in Saros county in the Bardejov region In the 1942 deportation records for Bardejov there is a Pesach Dovid Friedman listed These are the particulars I could piece together Jozef Friedman born 1866 of Bardejov married Betty Hollander Holender born Sept 7 1873 or Jun 2 1875 of Zborov They had several children One of them Pesach Dovid was born Oct 12 19 2 in Bardejov He married Sarolta Sara Beinhorn b Mar 28 19 5 of Mukachevo They had a son Otto Aser Friedman b Sept 16 1933 in Kosice He is living somewhere in the Boston area but I have not been able to locate him Pesach Dovid did have a living brother Samuel who was not able to shed any light on his grandparents A cursory check of the Bardejov records from 1852 1895 held by the Mormon Family History Center did not reveal any more information I came to this tree through a few different branches that turned out to be part of an entire tree There are some conflicting opinions in the various branches of this family regarding the big picture so I will try to stay clear of them Here are the facts Yitzchok married Chaya Tzivya and in 183 in Strzyzow they had Shabsi He married Frimit Licht in Lezajsk where they had 6 children In age order they are Moshe b 186 Mali Yosef Sara Freida Dovid b 1875 Mali Shabsi s second child was married to a cousin another Shabsi Miller They had Chaim Yitzchok in the 187 s and several other children Most of Mali s family died in a plague in the early 19 s in Lezajsk In 1914 due to problems with the Russians Shabsi returned home to Strzyzow He died there at the age of 84 on the second day of Rosh Hashana 1914 Several descendants of this family remember that they had cousins that are already in our tree making them definitely part of the big picture It is possible that Chaya Tzivya not her husband Yitzchok was the Miller Here is an email collection from one of the family members Shabsi Yitzchok Miller of Bukowsko had a daughter Bayla Chaya who married Hersh Kahan They lived in Sighet Rumania where they had many children I have not been able to locate any living survivors of this family although I have found a lot of information It seems that Hersh may have died before 1926 One of their daughters Nissel Nellie June 29 19 1 August 3 199 Hallandale FL came to NYC on August 17 1926 On the ship SS Maurentania manifest she lists her mother s Bayla Chaya address as Sighatul Mantati Ilic Mares 24 Nellie married Julius Harnik in 1938 They lived in the Bronx and later 1963 moved to Florida They did not have children but she did have a brother that lived in Zichron Yakov Israel named Shabsi Kahane He has a living son named Tzvi His whereabouts are unknown Nellie also had a niece from a sister named Esther somewhere in Haifa Israel and a nephew somewhere in Long Island NY In September 1997 I received a response from my inquiry to the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives in Israel They told me of Bluma Zipkin living in Tel Aviv at 5 Kehilat Sofia Street She is a daughter of Shabtaj Kohen and sister to Zwi Although I dialed the phone number supplied for her many times no one has ever picked up If anybody could flesh out this part of the tree please contact me There was a Raab Miller family in Lemburg Lvov One member was named Pesach Dovid and was a rabbi This family was presumed perished in the Holocaust Meshulom Zeesa Susholz a flour merchant was married to Bayla Chaya a very common name in the Shabsi Yitzchok branch of the family Brand They had several children including Esther Yocheved Itcha and Pinchus Zev b 19 1 One of the children married a Miller Pinchus Zev married Roiza Amkraut and lived in Kermanch Komancza a dorf near Sanok Galicia They had 3 children who currently reside in Brooklyn NY The rest of this family was presumed perished in the Holocaust Pinchus Zev s children remember Baila Horowitz as their cousin I spoke with her son R Sholom who told me that they are definitely related through the Miller side although he no longer remembers how He said his mother did know how I did find a Matilda Brand of Pittsburgh PA who was from a family with an aunt Brand married to a Susholz from the Sanok region She said she was currently overwhelmed with her own research to be of much help to me This was in February 1995 I forwarded copies of her letter to Pinchus Zev s children but I have not heard from anybody since then Izak Leib Muller born around 185 was married to Esther Yenta and they lived in Ganichi Rumania They had 6 children Yosef Moshe Avrohm Hersh Volf Rochel and Faiga Izak Leib s father may have been either Moshe or Shlomo Moshe has a son Mendel Volf who lived in Nyirbator Hungary He remembers my great grandfather Pesach Dovid Miller He knew that they were somehow cousins but he does not know how I have been in contact with Dr Ladislau Gyemant a very talented researcher in Rumania He was able to locate records regarding Izak Leib s children but so far nothing regarding Izak Leib s ancestry has turned up Other members of the Shabsi Miller family Shabsi Miller had many children One of them may have been a daughter married to an Unger This family owned a bakery and lived in Cleveland in the 196 time period Sheppi Reiss son of Chezkel Shrage remembers them from when he was learning in the Telshe Yeshiva Although I found Unger bakers in the area they deny being part of this family Another lost link is the Geneevish family One man was known to have survived the Holocaust and was living in Brooklyn I have not found anybody that can supply more information I spoke with one of Zeesha Greenberg s sons in July of 1996 He told me the following narrative His great grandfather Meshulam Zeesha died between 19 5 1911 He came to US once and went right back to Lebeach Galicia near Rava Russkaya in the Belze gaygen He married Chaya Serel Meiller Zeesha s father s name is written down in a book but the family can not find it Zeesha and Chaya Serel had a daughter Mirel Nesha Miller married to Leib Greenberg His death certificate states his mother s maiden name as Faiga Miller Mirel Nesha died 1944 in her 6 s in the US She is buried in Bais Moshe Cemetery in Long Island NY She had a lot of brothers and sisters Almost all her brothers perished in the Holocaust 1 was named Yankel Shmerel Some sisters survived 1 in CA 1 in TN Also 1 brother in the US Asher died in US had 1 son possibly named Zeesha Miller They were all related to the Miller s from Nowy Sacz and knew Akiva Miller I spoke to Akiva but he no longer knew the connection Mirel Nesha and Leib had about 1 children 2 survived the Holocaust Pesach Zeesha Zeesha s son Meyer had a son born and wanted to name him after his uncle Pesach He asked his rebbe who said to add a name because the uncle died before reaching 6 Meyer knew he had a zeide Asher Meyer had an aunt over 9 Pesach s wife Surtcha She said Asher was a chushuva important man from a brother of the Bnei Yissochur She said that she and Pesach were cousins from before marriage

In the 1942 deportation records for Bardejov, there is a Pesach Dovid Friedman listed.\r\nThese are the particulars I could piece together:\r\nJozef Friedman, born 1866, of Bardejov, married\tBetty Hollander/Holender\r\n(born Sept 7, 1873 or Jun 20, 1875) of Zborov. They had several children.\r\nOne of them, Pesach Dovid, was born Oct. 12, 1902, in Bardejov. He married\r\nSarolta/Sara Beinhorn (b. Mar. 28, 1905) of Mukachevo. They had a son, Otto Aser\r\nFriedman (b. Sept. 16, 1933) in Kosice. He is living somewhere in the Boston area \r\nbut I have not been able to locate him. Pesach Dovid did have a living brother,\r\nSamuel, who was not able to shed any light on his grandparents. A cursory check of\r\nthe Bardejov records from 1852-1895, held by the Mormon Family History Center, did\r\nnot reveal any more information. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A NAME=\"A4\"> </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<A HREF=\"#Q4\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" align=\"right\" border=0 height=31 width=19 ALT=\"\"></A>\r\n&#149;I came to this tree through a few different branches that turned\r\nout to be part of an entire tree. There are some conflicting opinions in the\r\nvarious branches of this family regarding the big picture, so I will try to stay\r\nclear of them. Here are the facts:\r\nYitzchok married Chaya Tzivya, and in 1830, in Strzyzow, they had Shabsi. He\r\nmarried Frimit Licht, in Lezajsk, where they had 6 children. In age order, they are: Moshe (b. 1860), \r\nMali, Yosef, Sara, Freida, &amp; Dovid (b. 1875). Mali, Shabsi's second child, was married (to a cousin, \r\nanother [Shabsi?] Miller?). They had Chaim Yitzchok, in the 1870's, and several other children. Most of \r\nMali's family died in a plague, in the early 1900's, in Lezajsk. In 1914, due to problems with the \r\nRussians, Shabsi returned home, to Strzyzow. He died there, at the age of 84, on the second day of Rosh \r\nHashana, 1914. Several descendants of this family remember that they had cousins that are already\r\nin our tree, making them definitely part of the big picture. It is possible that Chaya Tzivya, not her \r\nhusband Yitzchok, was the Miller.\r\n<BR>\r\n<a href=\"rpsab.htm\">Here</a> is an email collection from one of the family members.\r\n<P>\r\n<A NAME=\"A5\"> </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<A HREF=\"#Q5\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" align=\"right\" border=0 height=31 width=19 ALT=\"\"></A>\r\n&#149;<A HREF=\"shabsib.htm\">Shabsi Yitzchok Miller</A> of Bukowsko had a daughter,\r\n<A HREF=\"shabsib.htm#L1.2.2.8\">Bayla Chaya</A>, who married Hersh Kahan. They lived\r\nin Sighet, Rumania, where they had many children. I have not been able to locate\r\nany living survivors of this family, although I have found a lot of information.\r\nIt seems that Hersh may have died before 1926. One of their daughters, Nissel\r\n(Nellie; June 29, 1901 - August 30, 1990 [Hallandale, FL]), \r\ncame to NYC on August 17, 1926.

They lived in the Bronx and later (1963?) moved to\r\nFlorida. They did not have children, but she did have a brother that lived in\r\nZichron Yakov, Israel, named Shabsi Kahane. He has a living son, named Tzvi.\r\nHis whereabouts are unknown. Nellie also had a niece from a sister, named Esther,\r\nsomewhere in Haifa, Israel, and a nephew somewhere in Long Island, NY. In September 1997 \r\nI received a response from my inquiry to the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives in Israel. \r\nThey told me of Bluma Zipkin, living in Tel-Aviv at 5 Kehilat Sofia Street.

My father is 80 years old and \r\ndoes not remember many things, his brother, who still alive is even older.\r\nMy father is Moshe Aharon Rebhun, he was born on 4.8.1919 in Nowy Sacz, \r\nPoland.They moved to Krakow at about 1920.\r\nHis father name was Chune Keller. Latter the last name of Chune's children \r\nwas chanced to Wagschal, my father's mother maiden name. According to my \r\nfather the name was chanced because his parents were married only by \r\nJewish marriage. Latter on the last name was chanced to Rebhun, supposedly \r\nthe last name of Chune Keller mother.\r\nI do not know any further details about Chune Keller, not his parents \r\nnames and not if he had brothers or sisters.\r\n\r\nAttached hereinbelow please find some data from the Family Tree.\r\n\r\nBest Regards.

I expect to put them in the mail Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the JewishGen Family Finder, I noticed that\r\nyou have research interest in REBHUN.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Benjamin STERN\r\n(father of Moses STERN, who was my mother's father)\r\nhad a sister, Malka STERN, who was married to a REBHUN.\r\nMalka had children Yankl (who married Lola)\r\nand another son (who married Ruth).\r\nRuth had a couple of daughters: Rachel (who married TAUBER)\r\nand Esther (who married BRAUNSTEIN),\r\nboth of whom lived in Brooklyn as of 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nAny additional information that you might have about the REBHUN\r\nfamily tree would be most welcome.  It would be wonderful if\r\nthere was overlap between the REBHUNs that I know about and\r\nthose of whom you have knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Rebspec@aol.com \r\nDate: Mon, 17 Jan 2000 00:22:30 EST \r\nSubject: REBHUN/REBHUHN Family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\nX-Mailer: Windows AOL sub 45 \r\n\r\n\r\nHi.\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry it has taken me so long to respond to you. \r\n\r\n\r\nI looked at your website and forwarded the info to my cousin who was born in \r\nPrzemysl.
