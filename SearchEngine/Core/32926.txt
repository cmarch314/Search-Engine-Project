Research Part 5 Applications 4 Neocortex Neocortex and the thalamocortical system Based on these serial studies of paleocortex hippocampus cortical local circuits and the physiology and biochemistry of synaptic change via LTP initial forays were made in the late nineties into the most important systems of the brain thalamocortical circuits The neocortex which makes up the vast majority of human brain has a more complex structure than either paleocortex or hippocampus and is reciprocally linked to subregions of the thalamus via large feedforward thalamus to cortex and feedback cortex to thalamus pathways of axons A note on quantitative neuroanatomy Parallel computers in which many computing elements are wired together to operate in parallel offer a modest analogy with the brain If you look inside a parallel computer you will see mostly just wires This is because for every computing element added it is typically necessary to add wires from it to all the other computers The number of wires thus grows much faster than the number of computers 3 wires for 3 computers 6 wires for 4 computers 1 wires for 5 computers 15 wires for 6 computers etc In the brain with billions of neurons computing elements wiring them all together would require a brain the size of a football field Instead the brain only selectively and sparsely wires neurons together omitting any wires axons that it can in order to enable it to function This sparse connectivity leads to quite different mathematical operation of the system than if it were completely densely wired It also give us a hint of sorts as mammals grow larger with evolution and the brain grows correspondingly larger the cost of wires grows severe Even though neuroanatomists sometimes find evidence of axons connecting many different brain areas they also find quantitatively that the number of axons differ considerably with some areas heavily linked to others by large axon tracts and others much less strongly linked In large brained mammals such as humans anywhere large tracts of axons appear this is widely seen by neuroscientists as evidence of strong relative importance of the pathways in light of the intense pressure to cut back on any less than necessary axon tracts Thus in our models we emphasize large pathways and attend less to smaller pathways aware that something will be missed but hoping calculating that the more essential elements will this way be represented Anatomical structure of the thalamocortical system The structure of the system is outlined in the figure below Since not everything can or should be represented in a simulation and for the evolutionary reasons just described large axon pathways are emphasized at the expense of smaller ones Thalamocortical modeling Static inputs Neocortex e g auditory cortex can receive streams of inputs that are rapidly changing over time but can also pay sustained attention to a static or slowly changing input e g a hum an

thalamic reticular nucleus to the thalamic inputs to cortex effectively inhibited or masked the part of the input that cortex had responded to and thus sustained attention to an input yielded a series of different responses from cortex corresponding to hierarchical information category subcategory etc This finding generates specific predictions for human recognition performance We have tested these in a series of perception experiments on human subjects with findings supporting the predictions there is evidence that spontaneous unsupervised categories are constructed that they are accessed in ascending order of specificity category subcategory etc and that each step in this serially performed recognition takes a fixed quanta of time about 15 msec These new experimental findings have been

Thalamocortical modeling Time varying inputs Further modeling efforts have focused on the processing of superficial and deep neocortical layers in response to changing input streams such as speech or music Superficial layers are initially activated as described above but since subsequent inputs are not the same as previous ones i e the input is not static the input elicits a sequence of different superficial layer responses Deep layers V and VI receive brief sequences of activation from superficial layer and from thalamic matrix or nonspecific thalamic nuclei which strongly innervate all areas of neocortex The non topographic connectivity of thalamic matrix nuclei yield a broad range of different cortical responses The result is a model that produces quite different deep layer encodings for even very similar inputs i e the cortical encodings orthogonalize or emphasize the differences among inputs Analyses have demonstrated the relationship between this function and that of the common computational algorithm of hash coding which is widely used for efficient storage of large bodies of data Thus we have forwarded the hypothesis that the operation of cortical deep layers contributes

thalamocortical model The network consists of 26 cortical columns or modules each containing 1 synapses on deep layer neurons The inputs to the simulation are sequences of 2 letters chosen from the alphabet of 26 letters each corresponding to one of the simulated columns The curves show the mathematically calculated number of errors that should occur as the number of 2 letter sequences stored increases Curves are shown for conditions when 4 synapses versus 5 synapses are potentiated for each input letter n 4 vs n 5 The three points shown are the number of actual errors that occurred in a
