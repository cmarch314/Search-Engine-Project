The goal of this effort was two-fold: to make access to our program easier for<br>\nEuropean and international students and to create a Masters degree program for American students  <br>\nthat will expose them to foreign cultures and languages. <br>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter only 2 years of effort the program has been approved by the University of California in 2006. The <br>\nprogram is now being offered part time in Naples, Italy and part time in the US at UC Irvine. It is <br>\noffered in collaboration with the Institute of Cybernetics of the Italian National Research Council at<br>\ntheir location in Nalpes.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe program can be completed in 5 quarters, two summer quarters at UCI and 3 quarters in Naples.  The courses<br>\nand the teaching faculty are exactly the same as in the standard UC Irvine offering of the program and offer <br>\nan excellent general Computer Science degree with a particular emphasis on parallel and embedded systems.<br>\nUpon completion of the program the students can choose to undergo practical training at the many high technology<br>\ncompanies in California or can choose to pursue a PhD program at UCI or other California or US universities. <br>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditional details about the program can be founbd at the\n<A HREF=\"http://ms-es.cib.na.cnr.it/\"> program webiste  </A>  <BR>\n</p>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 8116.0}
