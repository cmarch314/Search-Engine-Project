The paper shows for the first time that for graphical models optimization queries weighted best-first and weighted depth-first Branch and Bound search schemes are competitive energy-minimization anytime optimization algorithms. Weighted best-first schemes were investigated for path-finding tasks, however, their potential for graphical models was ignored, possibly because of their memory costs and because the alternative depth-first Branch and Bound seemed very appropriate for bounded depth. The weighted depth-first search has not been studied for graphical models. We report on a significant empirical evaluation, demonstrating the potential of both weighted best-first search and weighted depth-first Branch and Bound algorithms as approximation anytime schemes (that have suboptimality bounds) and compare against one of the best depth-first Branch and Bound solvers to date.\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r210.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8466.0}
