Language XML and off the shelf tools like web servers and web browsers are enabling technologies for cheap and efficient inter business E commerce A side effect of this development is that the web is turning into a large and semi structured database However in contrast to traditional relational databases which can be accessed via SQL the web has no query and manipulation language for performing tasks in an automated manner We are specifically interested in automating tasks that require reliably filling in forms retrieving and processing web pages manipulating web pages etc In this talk I will present a programming language called WebL which was engineered for information processing on the Web In contrast to other languages WebL incorporates two novel features service combinators and a markup algebra Service combinators are language constructs that provide reliable access to web services by mimicking a web surfer s behavior when a failure occurs while retrieving a page The markup algebra extracts structured and unstructured values from pages for computation and is based on algebraic operations on sets of markup elements WebL can be used to quickly build and experiment with custom web crawlers meta search engines page transducers shopping robots supply chain integration systems data aggregators web mining etc Biography Hannes Marais is a member of the research staff at

and information retrieval applications on the Web Does Java Have Alternatives Michael Franz UC Irvine IRUS franz ics uci edu At first sight Java s position as the defacto standard for portable software distributed across the Internet seems virtually unassailable Interestingly enough however it is surprisingly simple to provide alternatives to the Java platform using the plug in mechanism supported by the major commercial World Wide Web browsers We are currently developing a comprehensive infrastructure for mobile software components This is a long term research activity and not directly related to Java and the World Wide Web However purely as a technology demonstration we have started a small spin off project called Juice with the intent of extending our experimental mobile code platform into the realm of the commercial Internet Juice is implemented in the form of a browser plug in that generates native code on the fly Although our software distribution format and run time a rchitecture are fundamentally different from Java s once the appropriate Juice plug in has been installed on a Windows PC or a Macintosh computer end users can no longer distinguish between applets based on Java and those based on Juice The two kinds of applets can even coexist on the same web page This however means that Java can in principle be complemented by alternative technologies or even gradually be displaced by something better with far fewer complications than most people seem to assume As dynamic code generation technology matures further it will become less important which code distribution format has the largest market share many such formats can be supported concurrently Future executable content developers may well be able to choose from a wide range of platforms probably including several dialects of Java itself Biography Michael Franz is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Computer Science at UC Irvine He holds an Engineer s
