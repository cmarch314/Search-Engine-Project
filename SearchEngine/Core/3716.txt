The first was\nprobably the winged-edge data structure proposed by Baumgart in\n1972, which was able to effectively represent complex topological\npolyhedra. This data structure has been implemented in many\napplications, including CAD, Computer Vision, etc. In this talk we\npresent some extensions to the winged-edge representation that\nallow more complex objects to be represented, e.g., polyhedra with\ncracks, multiple regions, etc. Such objects are often referred to\nas \"non-manifold\" for reasons presented in the talk. Various\nextensions are considered and their grounding in applications are\nhighlighted.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3716.0}
