Fundamental problems of computational geometry such as\nconvex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, polygon\npartitioning, arrangements, geometric searching, hidden surface\nelimination, motion planning.\n<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of homeworks,\na midterm, and a final exam. The overall grade\nwill be determined 40% from homework, 30% from the midterm, and\n30% from the final.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted, but each\nstudent must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.\nIf a student turns in a solution without listing\nthe others who helped produce this solution,\nthis act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Exam policy.</b>\nExam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration\nis allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams \nwill be considered cheating.\nIn addition to the procedures of the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html\">ICS \nCheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a \nfailing grade in the class.\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Text.</b> de Berg, Cheong, van Kreveld, and Overmars, \n<i>Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications</i>, Springer,\n2008, 3rd edition.\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Add/drop policy.</b> \nDrops will be accepted only up to the end of the third week. \n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Week 1:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nIntroduction. \nConvex hulls.\n<li>Reading: Chapter 1.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li><b>Week 2:</b></li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nLine segment intersections.
