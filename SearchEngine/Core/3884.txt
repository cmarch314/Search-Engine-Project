We apply a technique very familiar to computational\ngeometers\nbut still foreign to many researchers in (non-geometric) algorithms\nand data\nstructures, namely, to bound the complexity of an object via its\nforbidden substructures.\n\n<p>\nTo analyze an algorithm or data structure in the forbidden\nsubstructure\nframework one proceeds in three discrete steps. First, one\ntranscribes the\nbehavior of the algorithm as some combinatorial object $M$; for\nexample, $M$\nmay be a graph, sequence, permutation, matrix, set system, or tree.\n(The size\nof $M$ should ideally be linear in the running time.) Second, one\nshows that $M$\nexcludes some forbidden substructure $P$, and third, one bounds the\nsize of\nany object avoiding this substructure. The power of this framework\nderives\nfrom the fact that $M$ lies in a more pristine environment and that\nupper bounds\non the size of a $P$-free object $M$ may be taken \"off the shelf\". \n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3884.0}
