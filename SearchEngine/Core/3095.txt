Towards this goal, the course analyzes the relationship between computer architecture and program optimization. We will discuss high-performance, Multi-threaded, Multicore, Vector, Superscalar, and VLIW computer architectures. This will include discussions of not only hardware design, but also the code optimizations necessary to maximize the performance of these designs.\n       </p>\n       <p> Please refer to the <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/14f/35270\">class website</a> for more information.</p>\n     </p>\n     <br> <br>\n\n     <p>          \n        <h2> WINTER 2014, COMPSCI 131 <p>Parallel and Distributed Computing</p> </h2> \n       <p> The class was joint with Professor Alex Veidenbaum</p>\n        <hr> \n          <p>\nThis course is an introduction to parallel and distributed systems and their programming. It examines major concepts involved in creating parallel/distributed software and applications using a collection of independent, communicating single-processor systems. Performance issues in such systems are also covered.\nMajor topics covered in this course are: Hardware parallel and distributed systems; Programming models; OS support; Parallel/Distributed programming and performance; Coordination and Synchronization; Consistency and replication; Transactions.\n          </p>\n     </p> \n      <p>\n        <br> <small>&copy; Ro Cammarota, 2013 </small>\n      </p>\n\n      <footer>\n        <hr>\n        <a href=\"http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer\">\n          <img style=\"border:0;width:88px;height:31px\"\n               src=\"http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue\"\n              alt=\"Valid CSS!\" />\n        </a>\n      </footer>  \n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3095.0}
