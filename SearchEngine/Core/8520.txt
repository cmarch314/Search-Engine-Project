These two forms of uncertainty are often found in many scheduling and planning\r\nscenarios. For such problems, we define several notions of desirable solutions. Such\r\nnotions take into account not only the optimality of the solutions, but also their degree\r\nof robustness (of the optimality status, or of the cost) w.r.t. the uncertainty present\r\nin the problem. We provide an algorithm to find solutions accordingly to the considered\r\nnotions of optimality, and we study the properties of these algorithms. For the\r\nuncontrollable variables, we propose to adopt a variant of classical variable elimination,\r\nwhere we act pessimistically rather than optimistically.\r\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r167.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8520.0}
