We show that the problem can be solved in\ntime 2^O(\u2113^2 log \u2113)\u22c5n, where \u2113=|\u03c3| and n=|\u03c0|. In other words, the\nproblem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size of the\nsubpattern to be found.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe introduce a novel type of decompositions for permutations and a\ncorresponding width measure. We present a linear-time algorithm that\neither finds \u03c3 as a subpattern of \u03c0, or finds a decomposition of \u03c0\nwhose width is bounded by a function of |\u03c3|. Then we show how to solve\nthe Permutation Pattern problem in linear time if a bounded-width\ndecomposition is given in the input.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBased on a paper by Sylvain Guillemot and Daniel Marx in Soda 2014.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3820.0}
