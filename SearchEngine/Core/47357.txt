described how one can travel to India Thailand and some other countries and get medical treatment for a small fraction of the cost that you have to pay in USA and can get wonderful treatment And there is increasing trend towards this This may be true and that is something that is a bit disturbing and annoying I hear many stories from friends and relatives when I go back there Unfortunately all these stories are exactly opposite of what you normally read in media about medical treatment in India Medical care even in reasonably big cities is beyond the reach of an average person for most serious problems And even expensive places lack basic care Surgery is particularly a situation that becomes complex due to inadequate post care not only due to facilities but also human chalega attitude I myself saw some of it when trying to take care of my father but that was more than 15 year ago I thought that things may have improved and I also started believing to some extent the stories in media about improving health care Based on what I hear when I visit there and what I heard in details very recently it appears that we have a long way to go to provide adequate health care to common Indians Health is a sensitive matter and most people are not satisfied with the care they and their family members receive But what you hear and see in India is still very serious We do have places that may be of top standards and beyond the reach of almost all but a few Indians that cater to foreigners to make money And true to India traditions most other facilities are more towards the other extreme Medical tourism is like five star hotels there are a few and they cater to well to do foreigners and really rich in India One can not judge Indian living conditions by visiting five star hotels By Ramesh November 15 2 7 General Updates 6 Comments Cameras will recognize youE2E Environemnt to Environment Connection 6 thoughts on Medical Tourism and Medical Care in India Healism June 9 2 8 at 4 41 am My views on medical tourism and it s health risks are rather mixed I had one friend who received heart surgery in India with no complaints Another friend had plastic surgery in Thailand and didn t enjoy it It s true Medical Tourism is only for rich Medical tourism is like five star hotels Nice Article thanks Worldmed Assist August 3 2 8 at 3 17 pm I agree with the article that the hospitals used by medical tourists are like 5 star hotels That is unfortunate for Indian healthcare On the other hand the investments that mainly private companies are currently making in Indian healthcare are tremendous This combined with wages in society increasing dramatically and the rise of health insurance products will hopefully improve the situation of Indian locals Patient Health Records October 21 2 8 at 2 12 am In India medical care has been tremendously increased and there are many facility that provides online health services Recently i have visted one site which provides health service which is emedireport com provides tremendous services like online consultation online doctors appointment and many more Online Doctor Appointment November 16 2 8 at 9 46 pm Medical care in India has changes a lot with different utmost technologies which makes us to get good service from all the health care centers Aalia November 2 2 8 at 11 46 pm nice to visit this site but i have more about medial TOurisim if u published i is honner or me Medical tourism also called medical travel health tourism or global healthcare is a term initially coined by travel agencies and the mass media to describe the rapidly growing practice of traveling across international borders to obtain health care Such services typically include elective procedures as well as complex specialized surgeries such as joint replacement knee hip cardiac surgery dental surgery and cosmetic surgeries However virtually every type of health care including psychiatry alternative treatments convalescent care and even burial services are available As a practical matter providers and customers commonly use informal channels of communication connection contract and in such cases this tends to mean less regulatory or legal oversight to assure quality and less formal recourse to reimbursement or redress if needed A specialized subset of medical tourism is reproductive tourism and reproductive outsourcing 1 which is the practice of traveling abroad to undergo in vitro fertilization surrogate pregnancy and other assisted reproductive technology treatments including freezing embryos for retro production 2 Over 5 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry 3 However accreditation and other measures of quality vary widely across the globe and there are risks and ethical issues that make this method of accessing medical care controversial rinky December 15 2 8 at 1 6 pm In India medical care has been tremendously increased and there are many facility that provides

That is unfortunate for Indian healthcare. On the other hand, the investments that mainly private companies are currently making in Indian healthcare are tremendous. This combined with wages in society increasing dramatically and the rise of health insurance products will hopefully improve the situation of Indian locals.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-2440\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-2440\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d507139a52528664c94266bf5f97e731?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.emedireport.com/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Patient Health Records</a> </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/medical-tourism-and-medical-care-in-india/comment-page-1/#comment-2440\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2008-10-21T02:12:55+00:00\">October 21, 2008 at 2:12 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In India medical care has been tremendously increased and there are many facility that provides online health services.

However, virtually every type of health care, including psychiatry, alternative treatments, convalescent care and even burial services are available. As a practical matter, providers and customers commonly use informal channels of communication-connection-contract, and in such cases this tends to mean less regulatory or legal oversight to assure quality and less formal recourse to reimbursement or redress, if needed. A specialized subset of medical tourism is reproductive tourism and reproductive outsourcing,[1] which is the practice of traveling abroad to undergo in-vitro fertilization, surrogate pregnancy and other assisted reproductive technology treatments including freezing embryos for retro-production.[2]</p>\n<p>Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry.[3] However, accreditation and other measures of quality vary widely across the globe, and there are risks and ethical issues that make this method of accessing medical care controversial.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-2563\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-2563\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d809f76bbb7f6bac8ee1df618874901d?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.formaer.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>rinky</a> </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/medical-tourism-and-medical-care-in-india/comment-page-1/#comment-2563\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2008-12-15T22:06:14+00:00\">December 15, 2008 at 10:06 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In India medical care has been tremendously increased and there are many facility that provides online health services.
