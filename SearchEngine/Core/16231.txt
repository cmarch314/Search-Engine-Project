exam.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/sortingwithinterfaces.zip\">\r\n  Sorting (with Interfaces) Demonstration</a><br>\r\nA driver program for using the <b>Arrays.sort</b> method on arrays of\r\n   <b>Point</b>s.\r\nIt includes classes that implement the <b>Comparator</b> interface,\r\n   for sorting by X coordinate, by Y coordinate, by distance from the\r\n   origin, and by angle from the origin (in all cases, both increasing\r\n   and decreasing through the use of the <b>ReverseAComparator</b>\r\n   decorator.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/sorting.zip\">Sorting Methods Demonstraction</a><br>\r\nThis program is a driver for the sorting methods in the <b>Sort</b> class\r\n  (included in this download).\r\nIt allows the testing and timing of all these sort methods, and\r\n  <b>Arrays.sort</b>.\r\nIt also contains an executable, that you can run immediately.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/statespacesearch.zip\">State Space Search</a><br>\r\nThese programs use a generalized state-space searching to solve various\r\n  various problems involving applying operators.\r\nSee the <b>stateSpace</b> package, which contains the <b>Problem</b> interface,\r\n  and the <b>Solver</b> class, which solves any problem expressible by a class\r\n  implementing this interface.\r\nThe <b>puzzleNxN</b> package contains a <b>PuzzleNxN</b> class and a simple\r\n  application that uses <b>Solver</b> to solve it (how to acheive a standard\r\n  puzzle configuration).\r\nThe <b>waterJugs</b> package contains a <b>WaterJugs</b> class and a simple\r\n  application that uses <b>Solver</b> to solve it (how to achieve a certain\r\n  configuration).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/supermarket.zip\">Supermarket Simulation</a><br>\r\nThis program simulates a supermarket using queues (for the checkout lines)\r\n  and priority queues (for the scheduling events; the event to happen most\r\n  closely in the future has the highest priority).\r\nThe simulated supermarket is specified by an array storing the maximum number\r\n  of items that can be checked-out in each line.\r\nThe events are \"enter the store and start shopping\" (at random intervals),\r\n  \"enter a checkout line\" (based on the number of items bought, the sizes\r\n  of the lines, and how many items are allowable), start checkout process\r\n (keep track of shopper's wait time: from entering a line to checking out),\r\n  and \"exit store\".\r\nThe unhappiness of a custom is computed (line wait time/shop time) and\r\n  an average over all shoppers is reported.\r\nThe program also reports the running time and simulation speed (# of events\r\n  processed/second).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/threads.zip\">Thread Demonstrations</a><br>\r\nThis folder contains four small programs that demonstrate threads:\r\n<b>Thread</b>/<b>Runnable</b> illustrate two ways to use threads.\r\n<b>Timer</b> illustrates how to use an action listener which is activated\r\n  regularly.\r\n<b>Animation</b> shows how such a time can be used to run a tiny GUI animation.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/treeheights.zip\">Tree Heights</a><br>\r\nThis folder contains a program and an executable that builds random trees\r\n  and shows a histogram of their heights.\r\nIt illustrates the heights of random trees, which are much closer to\r\n  their minimum than their maximums.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/tripplanner.zip\">Trip Planner</a><br>\r\nThis program prompts the user for information about the price of gas\r\n  and the length of a trip and computes the number of tanks of gas\r\n  needed, the cost, and the amount of few remaining in the tank on arrival.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/views.zip\">\r\n  View Demonstrations</a><br>\r\nDemonstrations of using <b>JFrame</b>s and <b>JPanel</b>s.\r\nThe <b>JFrame</b> demonstration shows how to create, position, size,\r\n  and label windows.\r\nThe <b>JPanel</b> demonstrations show how to draw figures, put text,\r\n  put icons (and animate them), and put buttons into <b>JPanel</b>s.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/xref.zip\">X (cross) Reference</a><br>\r\nThis program produces a cross-reference list of any text file.\r\nIt uses the map and list collection classes to do so: the\r\n  <b>Application</b> class uses non-generic collections (pre Java 1.5)\r\n  and the <b>GenericApplication</b> class uses Java 1.5 Generic\r\n  collections (and one Java 1.5 <b>for</b> loop).\r\nThe download includes a complete copy of Mark Twain's \"Tom Sawyer\"\r\n  and the correct output for this input.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<!--Download: <a href=\"programs/faceflasher.zip\">Face Flasher</a>--->\r\nDownload: <a href=\"../misc/preclass/midtermgrades.xls\">Face Flasher</a>\r\n\r\n<hr
