in Computer Games and Virtual Worlds By staff October 2nd 2 12 In November of 2 1 more than 3 scholars engaged in research on topics related to Computer Games and Virtual Worlds CGVWs participated in a workshop at UC Irvine to identify future research problems and opportunities in this arena During the past year and a half the workshop continued online culminating in the production of an extensive report characterizing this dynamic field of study The report is now freely available What follows is the executive summary of this report More than 3 scholars engaged in research on topics related to Computer Games and Virtual Worlds CGVWs participated in a workshop to identify future research problems and opportunities in this arena Six working group topics were identified based on the scholarship and interests of the invited participants The groups were then tasked to meet discuss and debate their respective topics the results of which appear as the first six chapters of this report The six CGVW chapter topics are Computer Systems Technologies for CGVWs multi core and many core processors computer graphics hardware and software networking databases language design sensors etc Advanced GGVW Technologies AI behavioral scripting narrative and emergent systems procedural and non procedural content generation avatar generation and customization world building kits etc Media Art Culture and History of CGVWs CGVWs as media art literature and expressive forms of social critique new literacies creativity with or through CGVW etc Anthropological Behavioral Sociological Studies of CGVWs ethnographic studies of CGVWs work versus play or work as play or play as work patterns of migration across CGVWs CGVW in complex enterprise settings research methods for studying CGVWs Education and Learning with CGVWs how CGVW sfacilitate or inhibit learning in formal or informal education settings play as learning CGVWs for STEM and Humanities learning etc CGVWs for Science Health Environment Energy Defense CGVWs as research tools or infrastructure for R D in other scientific industrial or government domains etc Each chapter addresses a common set of concerns including current research findings emerging research problems of high consequence future research infrastructure needs and broader impacts arising from research investments in each of the six topic areas Contributors to these chapters represent a diverse set of scholars and disciplines that might not otherwise be drawn together No effort was directed to integrating the results presented across the chapters so each chapter can be read and reviewed standalone though better if reviewed comparatively across chapters The report also identifies overall observations that advocate investment in future CGVW research Their intent is to be bold and stimulating These observations are summarized as follows CGVWs as new media and technologies of practice have the potential to pervade most if not all sectors of scientific research technology development educational and cultural practices in industry academia and government CGVWs are not a killer app but instead CGVWs are more likely the next Web a new layer of systems and applications that can cross social organizational institutional and technological boundaries just like the World Wide Web has done over the past 15 or so years CGVWs are not about mere gamification by which we mean turning existing socio technical systems into those where users simply earn virtual badges points or prizes for accomplished game play Instead CGVWs are rich socio technical systems that can facilitate creativity new cultural practices new educational opportunities and new ways and means for stimulating research and higher education in the sciences health and related disciplines CGVWs are embracing the next generation workforce of those who will seek to work in the various MACH SHEED ABS and advanced IT disciplines industries or government agencies Market research figures suggest that at least one billion people world wide are now playing and interacting through CGVWs Investments in STEM education do not yet address this nor do current R D investments across government agencies identify this situation The U S currently leads the global development of new CGVW centered products and services Such socio economic condition and market leadership can be accelerated through investment in a new CGVW research agenda such as that identified in this report New firms and highly skilled jobs will emerge through such investments into CGVW research as can new markets Future research in CGVWs can be targeted to different research agencies and research programs that can maximize interests through targeted investments Games for health care represents one such application domain for focused CGVW research Games for health may be able to provide a new way and means for facilitating self managed chronic care ailments that can be personally rewarding as well as transformative not in the sense of curing the ailment but in the sense of making the ailment amenable to personal activity and self care more manageable Research in CGVWs overlaps most areas of current interest that advance the overall science research agenda for networked information technology NITRD 2 12 Massively multi user CGVWs represent new venues for communication and social interaction that generate big data about social behavioral cultural and technological practice all data that characterize societal processes New research challenge problems like reanimating the visible human can generate new scientific knowledge from domains that link or converge across nanotechnology biology information technology and cognitive science NBIC disciplines The industries currently vested in CGVWs as entertainment media are not leading the way in pushing the R D horizons identified in this report Without coordination of research investment CGVW technology will emerge as disjoint islands of automation that will become evermore complex and costly to integrate for mutual benefit This report identified six related areas that would benefit from strategic or programmatic R D investments The national NITRD 2 12 agenda and grand challenge problem domains are both amenable to be favorably advanced through investment in CGVW research In particular the NITRD Program and this report put forward recommendations for a planning and coordination support request whose structure provides a model for what where how when and why to invest in to strategically stimulate CGVW research NITRD 2 12 pp 19 2 Co funding testbeds infrastructures and advanced tools instrumentation for experimentation with new CGVW technologies Workshops that mobilize and bring together researchers program managers and socio economic leaders Collaborative deployment of new CGVW system infrastructures tools repositories archives across R D programs Interagency cooperation to focus research investment that identify and provide solutions to challenges in mission oriented SHEED programs Technical standards for interoperable scalable secure and scalable CGVW systems and infrastructures Testbeds that enable the joint R D experimentation crowdsourcing and decentralized study of CGVWs and a Science and Technology Steering Council Overall CGVWs are an engine of innovation one that can stimulate the production of new knowledge and practice in multiple scientific creative cultural educational and IT centered disciplines industries and government agencies CGVWs are emerging as socio technical ecosystems for addressing problems in areas such as education socio economic development health care and scientific research This statement is based not on speculation but on diverse R D results projects and expertise cited in this report and beyond see Steinkuehler Squire 2 11 CGVWs represent transformative technologies and socio economic practices whose time is coming and whose opportunity to strategically invest is near at hand If the purpose of careful and cautious investment of limited public funds is to realize the greatest benefits to many diverse public and private interests then CGVW merits serious attention consideration and commitment of resources that can fuel this engine of innovation Such engines of growth and prosperity are uncommon and often elusive Keep this new engine of innovation well fueled and fund its improvement References NITRD 2 12 Supplement to the President s Budget FY 2 13 The Networking and Information Technology

future research problems and\u00a0opportunities in this arena. During the past year and a half the workshop continued online, culminating in the production of an extensive report characterizing this dynamic field of study.

Six working group topics were identified based on the scholarship\u00a0and interests of the invited participants. The groups were then tasked to meet, discuss, and debate their respective topics, the results of which appear as the first six chapters of this\u00a0report. The six CGVW chapter topics are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computer Systems Technologies for CGVWs\u2014multi-core and many core processors,\u00a0computer graphics hardware and software, networking, databases, language design,\u00a0sensors, etc.</li>\n<li>Advanced GGVW Technologies\u2014AI, behavioral scripting, narrative and emergent\u00a0systems, procedural and non-procedural content generation, avatar generation and\u00a0customization, world building kits, etc.</li>\n<li>Media, Art, Culture and History of CGVWs\u2014CGVWs as media, art, literature and\u00a0expressive forms of social critique; new literacies, creativity with or through CGVW, etc.</li>\n<li>Anthropological, Behavioral, Sociological Studies of CGVWs\u2014ethnographic studies of\u00a0CGVWs, work-versus-play or work-as-play or play-as-work, patterns of migration across\u00a0CGVWs, CGVW in complex enterprise settings, research methods for studying CGVWs.</li>\n<li>Education and Learning with CGVWs\u2014how CGVW sfacilitate or inhibit learning in formal\u00a0or informal education settings, play as learning, CGVWs for STEM and Humanities\u00a0learning, etc.</li>\n<li>CGVWs for Science, Health, Environment, Energy, Defense\u2014CGVWs as research tools or\u00a0infrastructure for R&amp;D in other scientific, industrial, or government domains, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each chapter addresses a common set of concerns including current research findings,\u00a0emerging research problems of high consequence, future research infrastructure needs, and\u00a0broader impacts arising from research investments in each of the six topic areas. Contributors to these chapters represent a diverse set of scholars and disciplines that might\u00a0not otherwise be drawn together. No effort was directed to integrating the results presented\u00a0across the chapters, so each chapter can be read and reviewed standalone, though better if\u00a0reviewed comparatively across chapters.</p>\n<p>The report also identifies overall observations that advocate investment in future CGVW research.\u00a0Their intent is to be bold and stimulating. These observations are summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>CGVWs as new media and technologies of practice have the potential to pervade most, if not all,\u00a0sectors of scientific research, technology development, educational and cultural practices in\u00a0industry, academia, and government. CGVWs are not a \u201ckiller app,\u201d but instead CGVWs are more\u00a0likely the next Web: a new layer of systems and applications that can cross social, organizational,\u00a0institutional and technological boundaries, just like the World-Wide Web has done over the past\u00a015 or so years.</p>\n<p>CGVWs are not about mere \u201cgamification\u201d by which we mean turning existing socio-technical \u00a0systems into those where users simply earn virtual badges, points, or prizes for accomplished \u00a0game play. Instead, CGVWs are rich socio-technical systems that can facilitate creativity, new \u00a0cultural practices, new educational opportunities, and new ways and means for stimulating research and higher education in the sciences, health, and related disciplines.</p>\n<p>CGVWs are embracing the next-generation workforce of those who will seek to work in the \u00a0various MACH, SHEED, ABS, and advanced IT disciplines, industries or government agencies. \u00a0Market research figures suggest that at least one billion people world-wide are now playing and \u00a0interacting through CGVWs. Investments in STEM education do not yet address this, nor do \u00a0current R&amp;D investments across government agencies identify this situation.</p>\n<p>The U.S. currently leads the global development of new CGVW-centered products and services.\u00a0Such socio-economic condition and market leadership can be accelerated through investment in a new CGVW research agenda, such as that identified in this report. New firms and highly skilled \u00a0jobs will emerge through such investments into CGVW research, as can new markets.</p>\n<p>Future research in CGVWs can be targeted to different research agencies and research \u00a0programs that can maximize interests through targeted investments. Games for health care \u00a0represents one such application domain for focused CGVW research. Games for health may be \u00a0able to provide a new way and means for facilitating self-managed chronic care ailments that can \u00a0be personally rewarding as well as transformative\u2014not in the sense of curing the ailment, but in the sense of making the ailment amenable to personal activity and self-care more manageable.<br />\nResearch in CGVWs overlaps most areas of current interest that advance the overall science \u00a0research agenda for networked information technology (NITRD 2012). Massively multi-user CGVWs represent new venues for communication and social interaction that generate big data about social, behavioral, cultural, and technological practice, all data that characterize societal processes. New research challenge problems like reanimating the visible human can generate new scientific knowledge from domains that link or converge across nanotechnology, biology, information technology, and cognitive science (NBIC) disciplines.</p>\n<p>The industries currently vested in CGVWs as entertainment media are not leading the way in pushing the R&amp;D horizons identified in this report. Without coordination of research investment, CGVW technology will emerge as disjoint, islands of automation that will become evermore complex and costly to integrate for mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>This report identified six related areas that would benefit from strategic or programmatic R&amp;D investments. The national NITRD (2012) agenda and grand challenge problem domains are both amenable to be favorably advanced through investment in CGVW research. In particular, the NITRD Program and this report put forward recommendations for a planning and coordination support request whose structure provides a model for what, where, how, when, and why to invest in to strategically stimulate CGVW research (NITRD 2012, pp. 19-20): Co-funding testbeds, infrastructures, and advanced tools/instrumentation for experimentation with new CGVW technologies; Workshops that mobilize and bring together researchers, program managers, and socio-economic leaders; Collaborative deployment of new CGVW system infrastructures, tools, repositories/archives across R&amp;D programs; Interagency cooperation to focus research investment that identify and provide solutions to challenges in mission-oriented SHEED programs; Technical standards for interoperable, scalable, secure, and scalable CGVW systems and infrastructures; Testbeds that enable the joint R&amp;D experimentation, crowdsourcing, and decentralized study of CGVWs; and a Science and Technology Steering Council.</p>\n<p>Overall, CGVWs are an engine of innovation: one that can stimulate the production of new knowledge and practice in multiple scientific, creative, cultural, educational and IT-centered disciplines, industries, and government agencies. CGVWs are emerging as socio-technical ecosystems for addressing problems in areas such as education, socio-economic development, health care, and scientific research. This statement is based not on speculation, but on diverse R&amp;D results, projects, and expertise cited in this report and beyond (see Steinkuehler Squire 2011). CGVWs represent transformative technologies and socio-economic practices whose time is coming, and whose opportunity to strategically invest is near at hand. If the purpose of careful and cautious investment of limited public funds is to realize the greatest benefits to many diverse public and private interests, then CGVW merits serious attention, consideration, and commitment of resources that can fuel this engine of innovation.
