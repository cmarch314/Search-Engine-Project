selection mode F11 Face selection mode Tips Double click an edge to select the corresponding edge loop While doing either a single click or marquee selection Hold Ctrl to deselect hold Shift to toggle selection or hold Ctrl Shift to select without deselecting other components or objects Object Component Manipulation w Move Tool e Rotate Tool r Scale Tool the plus key Makes the tool size larger affects all manipulation tools Bigger tool handle sizes make small adjustments easier the minus key Makes the tool size smaller x Grid Snap Hold while using the Move Tool to snap the selected component or object to a location on the grid v Vertex Snap Hold while using the Move Tool and hover the mouse over a vertex to snap the selected component or object to that vertex s position Works for both single axis and multi axis movement Tip Red tool handles correspond to the x axis green to the y axis and blue to the z axis Remember this color scheme as it is used consistently throughout Maya for easy axis identification Mesh Editing Tools Edit Mesh Insert Edge Loop Tool Inserts a continuous loop of edges perpendicular to the edge specified Left click hold and drag to choose where exactly the new loop goes Edit Mesh Extrude Extrudes a set of faces or edges Be careful not to extrude a face more than once without moving the extruded face first as that will result in overlapping faces and tricky to fix geometry Edit Mesh Interactive Split Polygon Tool Select points on the edges of a face or faces to split the polygon While the tool is active you can hit Delete to go back one and Enter to finalize Edit Mesh Append to Polygon Tool Connects two edges together with a new face The edges being connected must be open adjacent to a hole not on a closed surface and part of the same object Ctrl d Duplicate the selected objects Mesh Combine Combines the selected meshes into one Disconnected pieces of geometry will stay disconnected but they will still count as part of the same object The Most Important Hotkeys You Will Ever Learn Ever z Undo Undoes the last thing you did Applies to selections and deselections as well Does not apply to camera movement by default Maya s undo queue is initially set to only allow 5 undos in a row so go to Window Settings Preferences Preferences select Undo from the list and set the Queue Size to something like 5 You can set it to Infinite but that may increase the likelihood of Maya crashing Note for later in the year importing resets the undo queue so be careful Z Shift z Redo Undone things are reverted Be careful not to select or deselect anything if you are doing of bunch of redos as that will reset the redo queue g Repeat last action If you need to perform a single action multiple times such as extruding but do not want to repeatedly dig through Maya s menus just hit the g key In this project we will create a boat using a polygon mesh Shown below is our reference image as well as the final output Create a new Maya file to begin Before you start make sure you are using the Polygons menu set as you will frequently be using commands from this menu set Also verify that Edit Mesh Keep Faces Together is checked This will affect how faces are extruded Create a cube Create Polygon Primitives Cube Move and scale the cube so that it resembles the cube below The size of the cube is not as important as its proportions Add edge loops in the shown locations Edit Mesh Insert Edge Loop Tool Go to the top camera to view the boat from above Select each row of vertices in the front of the boat and scale them inward to create a tapered point Go to the side camera Select the bottom vertices and move them up to create the slope of the hull in the profile Right now the hull will only appear curved from the top and side views However the perspective view reveals that there are very sharp creases going down the sides of the boat Using the a combination of the perspective and front views select the edges along the bottom of the boat and move the them up to create a curved hull Select all of the top faces of the hull and extrude them upward Edit Mesh Extrude Immediately after extruding use the Scale Tool to shrink them inward and then move them up slightly to create the deck of the boat In the top view move the edge loops specified in the picture outward so they create a border of uniform width on the sides of the deck Add an edge loop to the front and back of the deck to complete the border Select all the faces in the border and extrude them straight up slightly to create a rim around the deck Select the faces toward the back of the deck and extrude them then scale them inward With the same faces selected extrude them upward three times to create the cabin However before doing so you should be introduced to a very important and useful hotkey if you have not been already the g key This hotkey activates the last action tool used so you do not have to repeatedly navigate the menus Use the g key to complete the extrusions Using a combination of the scale and move tool adjust the vertices to give the cabin a sleeker look The front faces of the cabin should slant and curve backwards Add the edge loops shown in the picture once you are done Select the top faces of the cabin extrude them out and then move them down as necessary to create the lip of the roof Use the Interactive Split Polygon Tool Edit Mesh Interactive Split Polygon Tool to create the lines shown in the picture on each side of the cabin roof Since the previous step created triangular polygons create the following highlighted lines so the mesh stays in quads Extrude the newly created quads up twice and slant them slightly backwards Scale and move the vertices as shown and then delete the inside faces of the fins Using the Append to Polygon Tool Edit Mesh Append to Polygon Tool select one of the edges on the border of the deleted face then select the corresponding edge on the other fin This should create a face that bridges the gap Do this this for the other 3 edges Create a cylinder Create Polygon Primitives Cylinder Move scale and rotate the cylinder until it is in the shown position In the Channel Box click polyCylinder1 in the Inputs section and make sure Subdivisions Axis is equal to 12 Using the Insert Edge Loop Tool add an edge loop toward the end of the propeller shaft In groups of two select every other group of faces and extrude them outward to create the basic propeller shape Scale and rotate the vertices on the edge of the propeller blades to give them a more turbine like shape Select the newly created propeller and duplicate it Edit Duplicate Move the new propeller over Do this one more time so you have 3 propellers In object mode select all three propellers and the ship Combine all four objects into one mesh to create the final boat model Mesh Combine In the Outliner or Channel Box rename the boat to poly boat You can change its name by double clicking on its current name which should be something like polySurface1 With that you should be finished Turn In You will be graded on the following Following InstructionsResemblance to tutorial
