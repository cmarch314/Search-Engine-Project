This result solves a question posed by G&uuml;nter M.

An immediate consequence of our result is that O(log n)-bit\ncoordinates suffice for a greedy routing strategy in planar 3-trees.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://erikdemaine.org/papers/StackedPolytopes_SODA2011/paper.pdf\">a paper by Erik D.
