Cutset sampling is motivated\r\nby the Rao-Blackwell theorem which\r\nimplies that sampling over a subset of variables\r\nrequires fewer samples for convergence\r\ndue to the reduction in sampling variance.\r\nThe scheme exploits the network structure\r\nin selecting cutsets that allow efficient computation\r\nof the sampling distributions. In\r\nparticular, as we show empirically, likelihood\r\nweighting over a loop-cutset (abbreviated\r\nLWLC), is time-wise cost-effective. We\r\nalso provide an effective way for caching\r\nthe probabilities of the generated samples\r\nwhich improves the performance of the overall\r\nscheme. We compare LWLC against regular\r\nliklihood-weighting and against Gibbsbased\r\ncutset sampling.</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r133.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8636.0}
