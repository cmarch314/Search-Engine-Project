between individuals the first group having to do with ordinary actions right Person P has the right to do action A if every other person Q has the duty to allow P to do A A right is one s affirmative claim against another Hohfeld1913 sflc 55 duty A duty is that which one ought or ought not to do privilege A privilege is one s freedom from the right or claim of another Hohfeld1913 sflc 55 no right

opposite ofimmunity Figure 2 Four legal relations for actions that change legal relationships and the second group having to do with actions that change legal relations power A power is one s affirmative control over a given legal relation as against another Hohfeld1913 sflc 55 disability immunity A n immunity is one s freedom from the legal power or control of another as regards some legal relation Hohfeld1913 sflc 55 liability Each relation is paired with its opposite the relation that is in a sense its negation and also with its correlative the relation that is in a sense its inverse Figures 1 and 2 If R and Ropp are opposites then for P to have relation R is equivalent to P to fail to have relation Ropp If R and Rcorr are correlatives then for P to have relation R is equivalent to all other persons Q to have a corresponding relation Rcorr Each relation is fundamentally between two people where a relation is presented as between a person P and many or all people the meaning is the union of all the pairwise relations between P and one of the other people For each relation R its opposite Ropp and its correlative Rcorr P has R is equivalent to P fails to have Ropp For the first quartet of relations R concerns doing an action A for the second quartet of relations R concerns changing a legal relation S Examples P has the right to do A P fails to have the no right to do A P has the duty to do A P fails to have the privilege to not do A P has the power to change S P fails to have the disability to change S P has immunity from changes to S P fails to have the liability to changes to S P has R is equivalent to Every person Q other than P has Rcorr Examples P has the right to do A Every Q other than P has the duty to allow P to do A P has the duty to do A Some Q other than P has a right that depends on P doing A P has the no right to do A Some Q other than P has the privilege to prevent P from doing A P has the privilege to do A Every Q other than P has the no right to do anything prevented by P doing A P has the power to change S Some Q other than P has a liability to changes in S P has the liability to changes in S Some Q other than P has a power to change S P has the disability to change S Every Q other than P has immunity to changes in S P has immunity to changes in S Every Q other than P has the disability to change S Quotations from Hohfeld s writings A duty or a legal obligation is that which one ought or ought not to do Duty and right are correlative terms When a right is invaded a duty is violated Hohfeld1913 sflc p32 if X has a right against Y that he shall stay off the former s land the correlative and equivalent is that Y is under a duty toward X to stay off the place Hohfeld1913 sflc p32 whereas X has a right or claim that Y the other man should stay off the land he himself has the privilege of entering on the land or in equivalent words X does not have a duty to stay off Hohfeld1913 sflc p32 The privilege of entering is the negation of a duty to stay off Hohfeld1913 sflc p32 when it is said that a given privilege is the mere negation of a duty what is meant of course is a duty having a content or tenor precisely opposite to that of the privilege in question Hohfeld1913 sflc p32 if A has not contracted with B to perform certain work for the latter A s privilege of not doing so is the very negation of a duty of doing so Hohfeld1913 sflc p33 References Balkin199 hals J M Balkin The Hohfeldian approach to law and semiotics University of Miami Law Review 44 1119 1142 199 Abstract This Essay attempts

the description of legal relationships was unnecessarily complicated by a lack of precise use of legal terms The Hohfeldian system is atomistic in that all legal relationships can be described with

no matter how complex can be described using one or more of the eight terms Some basic examples include Person X has a right to exclude from her land Person Y during war Person X has the privilege to kill the enemy soldier Person Y Person X has the power to nullify her contract with Corporation C and Person X a foreign diplomat in State S is immune from prosecution for acts related to her diplomatic role in State S by the court of State S As these examples show all relationships are between exactly two legal persons a natural person a corporation or a state More complex relationships are constructed by describing multiple relationships Ownership of land in the Hohfeldian system for example is a collection of legal relationships X has the right to exclude Y from the land X has immunity from Y expropriating the land X has the power to grant a privilege to Y to enter the land and X has the duty to not to use the land to harm Y Each term has one correlative term and a legal

is that Y has no right to sue X if X uses her privilege The correlative of power is liability If X has the power to nullify her contract with C then C has the liability that X may nullify the contract

He argued that the description of legal relationships was unnecessarily complicated by a lack of precise use of legal terms. The Hohfeldian system is atomistic in that all legal relationships can be described with only eight terms: right, duty, power, liability, immunity, disability, privilege, and &lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;no-right.&rsquo;&rsquo; These terms form a semiotic system: a set of interrelated terms whose individual meanings are not clear unless viewed in the context of the entire set of terms. There are four fundamental rules that apply to the system: 1) all legal relationships are between exactly two persons, 2) the state&rsquo;s monopoly on violence is necessary to implement the system, 3) each term has one correlative term and one opposite term; and 4) a relationship can be described using either term from a correlative pair. <p> All legal relationships, no matter how complex, can be described using one or more of the eight terms. Some basic examples include: Person X has a right to exclude from her land Person Y; during war, Person X has the privilege to kill the enemy soldier Person Y. Person X has the power to nullify her contract with Corporation C; and Person X, a foreign diplomat in State S, is immune from prosecution for acts related to her diplomatic role in State S by the court of State S. As these examples show, all relationships are between exactly two legal persons (a natural person, a corporation, or a state). </p><p> More complex relationships are constructed by describing multiple relationships. &rsquo;&rsquo;Ownership&rsquo;&rsquo; of land in the Hohfeldian system, for example, is a collection of legal relationships: X has the right to exclude Y from the land, X has immunity from Y expropriating the land, X has the power to grant a privilege to Y to enter the land, and X has the duty to not to use the land to harm Y. </p><p> Each term has one correlative term and a legal relationship can be expressed using the correlative term. If X has the right to exclude Y, then Y has the duty not to enter X&rsquo;s land. The correlative of X having the privilege to kill the enemy soldier Y is that Y has &rsquo;&rsquo;no-right&rsquo;&rsquo; to sue X if X uses her privilege. The correlative of power is liability. If X has the power to nullify her contract with C, then C has the liability that X may nullify the contract. Finally, if X has an immunity from prosecution by S, then S is disabled from prosecuting X.</p></div></div>\n  <span class='url'><span class='urlHeader'></span><a class='urlBody' href='http://www.kentlaw.edu/perritt/blog/2007/12/hohfeldian-primer.html'>html</a></span>\n  </div>\n  </dd>\n\n  <dt class='bib' id='Hohfeld1913-sflc' title='Hohfeld1913-sflc'>Hohfeld1913-sflc</dt>\n  <dd class='bibEntry'>\n  Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld.&nbsp;\n  Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning.&nbsp;\n    <i>Yale Law Journal</i>, 23(1):16&ndash;59,\n  Nov. 1913.&nbsp;\n  <div class='bibEntryAux'>\n  <span class='url'><span class='urlHeader'></span><a class='urlBody' href='http://www.jstor.org/stable/785533'>url</a></span>\n  </div>\n  </dd>\n\n  <dt class='bib' id='Hohfeld1917-flca' title='Hohfeld1917-flca'>Hohfeld1917-flca</dt>\n  <dd class='bibEntry'>\n  Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld.&nbsp;\n  Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning.&nbsp;\n    <i>Yale Law Journal</i>, (8):710&ndash;770,\n  1917.&nbsp;\n  <div class='bibEntryAux'>\n  <span class='url'><span class='urlHeader'></span><a class='urlBody' href='http://www.jstor.org/stable/786270'>url</a></span>\n  </div>\n  </dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n\n<!--xhtml -n -->\n</div>\n\n</div><!-- #TBg -->\n\n<div id='TFooter'>\n<div class='W3C'>\n  <a href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer'><img class='W3C'\n    src='../../img/valid-xhtml10-blue.png'\n    alt='Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict'/></a>\n  <br/>\n  <a href='http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer'><img class='W3C'\n    src='../../img/vcss-blue.png'\n    alt='Valid CSS!'/></a>\n</div>\n<div class='timestamp'>2010May16Su21:42</div>\n<div style='padding-top:1px;'>\n<a class='plain' href='./index.html' style='font-variant:small-caps;'\n>Thomas A.
