Research\npartnerships are relationships typically between an individual company \nand an individual faculty member, focused around a specific project or topic.\n<p>\nPartnerships can take many forms, and may have a variety of objectives.\nIn some cases companies financially sponsor a specific research project \nwhich is conducted at UCI. In some cases the focus is on transitioning \ntechnology from UCI to the company, with UCI investigators both helping in\nthe transition and then working with company to assess the benefits of the \ntechnology. Other projects may focus on UCI usage of corporate technology, \neither in the context of classroom usage or use in a research project. Still \nothers are directed at site visits for information exchange, consulting, or \narranging summer internships for students. UCI researchers are also \nactively engaged in several key standards bodies, such as the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org\">\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</a>\nRelationships with UCI researchers involved \nin these groups may be focused on helping to determine appropriate \nstrategies to take.\n<p>      \nIRUS provides forums to help establish these relationships. At technical\nroundtable meetings, for instance, companies may become aware of IRUS \nfaculty leading research efforts in areas of key concern to the companies. \nIRUS can also arrange briefings at corporate sites to further assist in\nidentifying avenues for cooperation.\n<p>\nThe following examples of recent partnerships indicates a few of\nthe many different relationships between IRUS \n<A HREF=\"sponsors.html\">\ncorporate sponsors</a> \nand IRUS \n<A HREF=\"faculty.html\">\nfaculty members</a>.\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <img src=\"images/blueball.gif\">\nWith The Boeing Company we are conducting a longitudinal study of the\nintroduction of group support technologies throughout the organization. \nThis began with a study of the roll out of Exchange and Schedule Plus and \nis continuing with studies of more advanced virtual collocation technologies.\n\n<p>\n<dt> <img src=\"images/blueball.gif\">\nWith Rockwell we are studying the application of design critics to\nsoftware requirements engineering. One goal of this project is to modify \nour software design environment to support a specific style of formal \nrequirements of interest to Rockwell, called CoRE. The UCI software \ndesign environment supports designers with \"cognitive\" features such as\nreminding, criticisms, and multiple perspectives.\n\n<p>\n<dt> <img src=\"images/blueball.gif\">\nWith Sun Microsystems we are studying the design and use of group\nsupport technologies within Sun at Bay Area sites. These studies are \nspanning the rollout of Network Computers and HotJava Views within Sun.\n\n<p>\n<dt> <img src=\"images/blueball.gif\">\nWith Hughes we have developed an integrated toolset for specifying and\ntesting complex software-intensive systems. This toolset combines and \nrefines several advanced technologies, including capabilities for specifying \nand reasoning about temporal properties, automated test execution, formal \nbehavior verification, and test adequacy measurement.\n\n<p>\n<dt> <img src=\"images/blueball.gif\">\nWith Northrop-Grumman we have investigated the application of\nheterogeneous hypermedia technologies to assist with problems of software \nsystems evolution.  In particular, hypermedia links are used to help capture \nand access design rationale and traverse the many relationships between \nartifacts produced during software development.\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n \n<h2> UC MICRO Program </h2>\nCompanies may be particularly interested in the benefits of sponsoring\nresearch projects via the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ucop.edu/research/micro/\">\nUC MICRO program.</a>\nSponsored research is envisioned to lead to the long-term development of \nnew products and technologies. A UC faculty investigator, by proposing a \nproject of mutual interest to one or more companies, obtains a pledge of a \ncash contribution to support that research over a period of one year. A \ntechnical proposal containing a project description and research strategy \nis reviewed by experts in industry and academia. Projects of sound technical \ncontent which lie within the scope of the MICRO program are approved by \nan Executive Committee. The State of California will co-sponsor an approved \nproject in two ways: by supplementing the industry contribution with cash, \nand by waiving the customary university overhead applied to research funds.\n\n<h2> Research Emphases and Projects </h2>\n\nTo find out more about IRUS research emphases and projects, visit our\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/research.html\">Research</a> page.\n\n\n\n<p>\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to the IRUS home page</A>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n\n", "id": 568.0}
