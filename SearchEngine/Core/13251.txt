local treewidth we characterize the other minor closed families with this property Specifically minor closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there exists an apex graph G that is

conference version of subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related problems but not included in the journal version Since its publication there have been many more works on local treewidth The

forbidden patterns we show that the 213 avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the known bound for all permutations and that any proper permutation subclass of the 213 avoiding permutations has near linear superpatterns We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets sets of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n vertex planar graphs We use our 213 avoiding superpatterns to construct universal sets of size approximately n2 4 and we also construct near linear universal sets for graphs of bounded pathwidth Small superpatterns for dominance drawing M J Bannister W E Devanny and D Eppstein arXiv 131 377 Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics ANALCO14 Portland Oregon 2 14 pp 92 1 3 We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of classes of acyclic graphs by finding forbidden patterns in the permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden In particular dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width 2 partial orders have universal point sets of size O n3 2 derived from superpatterns of the same size for the 321 avoiding permutations and dominance drawings of st planar graphs have universal point sets of size O n log n derived from superpatterns for riffle shuffles Publications David Eppstein Theory

Specifically,\nminor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there\nexists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph\nthat can be made planar by removing a single vertex.\nThe minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have\nbounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus\ngraphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the\ntreewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As\na consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and\napproximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed\nefficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar\ngraphs.\n<p>Some of these results\nwere announced in the conference version of\n\"<a href=\"p-psgi.html\">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related\nproblems</a>\" but not included in the journal version. Since its\npublication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of\nproblems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local\ntreewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, \"<a\nhref=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504794.504798\">Deciding first-order\nproperties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>\", <i>J.
