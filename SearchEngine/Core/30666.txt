{"text": "Next Saved Program States Up Saving States Previous Saving States Concepts It is possible to save the state of a running ECLiPSe system into a file that can be restored later There are basically two types of state that one might want to save A saved state of the current execution i e everything must be saved the compiled code the global data and the runtime data When such a saved state is restored the execution must continue as if the saved state had just been made In this chapter this saved state will be referred to as an execution saved state A saved state of the current program i e only the compiled code and the global data must be saved while the runtime data are not When such a saved state is restored ECLiPSe starts up as usual but with compiled code and global data already in memory In this chapter this saved state will be referred to as a program saved state Micha Meier Mon Mar 4 12 11 45 MET 1996", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/courses/ics-275a/fall-99/slides/node183.html", "title": "", "html": "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3O//DTD W3 HTML 2.0//EN\">\r\n<!Converted with LaTeX2HTML 95.1 (Fri Jan 20 1995) by Nikos Drakos (nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk), CBLU, University of Leeds >\r\n<HEAD>\r\n<TITLE> Concepts</TITLE>\r\n</HEAD>\r\n<BODY>\r\n<meta name=\"description\" value=\" Concepts\">\r\n<meta name=\"keywords\" value=\"umsroot\">\r\n<meta name=\"resource-type\" value=\"document\">\r\n<meta name=\"distribution\" value=\"global\">\r\n<P>\r\n <BR> <HR><A NAME=tex2html4440 HREF=\"node184.html\"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"next\" SRC=\"http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/new_icons//next_motif.gif\"></A>   <A NAME=tex2html4438 HREF=\"node182.html\"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"up\" SRC=\"http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/new_icons//up_motif.gif\"></A>   <A NAME=tex2html4432 HREF=\"node182.html\"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"previous\" SRC=\"http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/new_icons//previous_motif.gif\"></A>      <A NAME=tex2html4442 HREF=\"node321.html\"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"index\" SRC=\"http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/new_icons//index_motif.gif\"></A>   <BR>\r\n<B> Next:</B> <A NAME=tex2html4441 HREF=\"node184.html\"> Saved Program States</A>\r\n<B>Up:</B> <A NAME=tex2html4439 HREF=\"node182.html\"> Saving States</A>\r\n<B> Previous:</B> <A NAME=tex2html4433 HREF=\"node182.html\"> Saving States</A>\r\n<BR> <HR> <P>\r\n<H1><A NAME=SECTION001610000000000000000> Concepts</A></H1>\r\n<P>\r\nIt is possible to save the state of a running <A NAME=tex2html612 HREF=\"http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/eclipse.html\"><b> ECLiPSe</b></A>\r\n  system into\r\na file that can be restored later.\r\nThere are basically two types of state that one might want to save.\r\n<P>\r\n<UL><LI> A saved state of the current execution i.e. everything\r\nmust be saved: the compiled code, the global data and the runtime data.\r\nWhen such a saved state is restored, the execution must continue as\r\nif the saved state had just been made.\r\nIn this chapter, this saved state will be referred to as\r\nan <i> execution saved state</i>.\r\n<P>\r\n<LI> A saved state of the current program i.e. only the compiled\r\ncode and the global data must be saved, while the runtime data are not.\r\nWhen such a saved state is restored, <A NAME=tex2html613 HREF=\"http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/eclipse.html\"><b> ECLiPSe</b></A>\r\n  starts up as usual, but with\r\ncompiled code and global data already in memory.\r\nIn this chapter, this saved state will be\r\nreferred to as a <i> program saved state</i>.\r\n<P>\r\n</UL><BR> <HR>\r\n<P><ADDRESS>\r\n<I>Micha Meier <BR>\r\nMon Mar  4 12:11:45 MET 1996</I>\r\n</ADDRESS>\r\n</BODY>\r\n", "id": 30666.0}
