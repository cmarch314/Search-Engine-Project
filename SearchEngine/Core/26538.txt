(For the test, any directory will do, if a WWW server\nis not immediately available.)\n<LI>Create a set of directories within the directory. Each directory\nrepresents a distinct Chimera 2.0 hyperweb. Directories within\ndirectories are considered subwebs of the parent hyperweb. For example\ncreate the directories <tt>web1, web1/web1.1, web2, web2/web2.1,web2/web2.2,\nweb3, web3/web3.1, web3/web3.1/web3.1.1, etc.</tt> You can also give\nthese hyperwebs more meaningful names.</tt>\n</OL>\n\n<H3>Launching the Hyperweb Manager</H3>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>Change to the <tt>chimera</tt> directory created above.\n<LI>Launch the Hyperweb Manager with the command\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n<tt>java -Dchimera.hyperwebmanager.java=/opt/jdk-1.1.2/bin/java\nchimera.hyperwebManager -gui http://pyramides.ics.uci.edu/chimera/</tt>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<LI>You will need to modify the path for the java 1.1.x interpretor and the\nmachine name of the URL to match your local configuration.\n</OL>\n\n<P>The hyperweb manager's main window will soon appear, followed by the\nhyperweb server and Chimera server. (The hyperweb manager automatically\nlaunches a hyperweb server on start-up. When you shut\nthe hyperweb manager down, it will automatically shut this other server\ndown as well.)</P>\n\n<H3>Launching the Chimera Server</H3>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>Launch the Chimera server with the command\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n<tt>java chimera.chimeraServer\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<LI>Select the <tt>Servers</tt> panel of the Chimera server.\n<LI>Select the name of the machine listed in the panel. (It should be the\nname of the machine you are running these servers on.) If no names are\nlisted in the panel, type the name of the machine in the text edit\nfield located at the bottom of the panel and hit return. This will add\nthe name to the list. Once added, the machine name can be selected.\n<LI>The Chimera server will request the webs for the selected hyperweb\nmanager's website and display them within the <tt>Webs</tt> panel.\n<LI>Select a web, and the Chimera server will take you to the\n<tt>Links</tt> panel.\n<LI>Try creating a few links.\n<LI>Shut the hyperweb manager down and relaunch it.\n<LI>Verify that the links you created persisted between sessions.\n<LI>Finally, launch a WWW browser. Enter the following URL:\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nhttp://pyramides.ics.uci.edu:4009/hyperwebs/\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<LI>You will need to change the name of the machine listed in the URL to\nmatch your local configuration. The hyperweb manager has a dedicated port\nnumber of 4009. This number is registered with the Internet\nAssigned-Numbers Authority.\n<LI>The hyperweb manager will respond by generated an HTML page describing\nthe Chimera 2.0 website.\n</OL>\n\n<H3>Where to go from here?</H3>\n\n<P>\nThe Chimera&nbsp;2.0 release does not come with any integrated clients, so\nthe next step after these tests would be to look at the API to the\nChimera server. This API is used to develop Chimera clients.
