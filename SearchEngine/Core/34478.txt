At the beginning of\ntheir document, they describe what they consider to be the rationale for\nversioning on the web.  My comments in this post apply to the rationale\nelements of their document.\n\nWhile I think their functional requirements draft provides a solid\nfoundation for a final draft document, it still requires some revision, and\ntightening up.  I offer the following comments in this vein.\n\nI think the first bullet, \"(Versioning) allows more efficient management of\nlarge web sites,\" is a benefit that can be ascribed to facilities for the\nmanagement of configurations of versioned resources, rather than simply to\nversioning individual resources.  Thus I see efficient management of large\nweb sites helped by CM capabilities working in tandem with versioning\ncapabilities, not simply by versioning capabilities alone.\n\nThe second bullet, \"(Versioning) allows concurrent and controlled access to\nresources by authors and editors\" is at once too broad and too restrictive.\nToo broad, because browsers already handle concurrent and controlled\naccess to resources: they serve the resource concurrently to everyone who\nasks for it (excepting cases where the resource is password protected).\nToo restrictive, because the potential roles of people employing versioning\ncapabilities is far greater than simply authors and editors.  Computer\nprogrammers, reviewers, managers, students, etc. are all people whose roles\nboth fall, and don't fall under \"authors and editors.\"\n\nHowever, I think this bullet does get at the essence of one of the most\nimportant capabilities versioning should provide: parallel development\nsupport, the ability for two or more people to simultaneously edit a\nresource.  The second issue alluded to in this bullet is access control, in\nmany versioning schemes a necessary support capability for parallel\ndevelopment.  Thus I think the \"concurrent and controlled access\" bullet\nshould be subdivided into two bullets:\n\n- Versioning provides parallel development support\n- Versioning provides access control over resources\n\nThe bullet stating that versioning enhances annotation support due to the\npreservation of the historical record merges several points which should be\nseparated:\n- Versioning provides a consistent naming scheme for versions of a resource\n\nThis supports two major rationales for versioning:\n- browse access to previous versions of a resource\n- annotation support\n\n- Jim Whitehead &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ejw@ics.uci.edu\">ejw@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0101.html\">David G.
