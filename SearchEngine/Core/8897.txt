I am also working on collecting, analysing and using instant search log.\n\n\n<h4>Education</h4>\n<ul> \n<li>M.S. of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California.\n<li>B.M. of Management, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Korea.\n<li>B.S. of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.   \n</ul>\n\n<h4>Current Projects</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='http://asterixdb.ics.uci.edu/'>AsterixDB</a><br>\n<li><a href='http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu/'>iPubMed</a> - an instant, error-tolerant search engine on the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">PubMed</a> database<br>\n<li>Monitor - instant search analysis<br>The goal of this research is to supplement instant search engine's performance without changing internal structure or data.<br>This is done by embedding one JavaScript to original search engine. This JavaScript collects queries, number of result, etc. and stores that data to Server.<br>Ranges of project are analysing user queries, Identifying sessions from queries, creating session related Statistics, and suggesting some useful queries to users by using log and raw-data.<br>At this moment, I am currently focusing on suggesting effective queries to user to reduce key-stroke and duration of each search session time.\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Publications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>Efficient Instant-Fuzzy Search with Proximity Ranking.</i></b>\n<br>\nInci Cetindil, Jamshid Esmaelnezhad, Taewoo Kim, Chen Li\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu/pubs/icde2014-proximity-ranking.pdf\">ICDE 2014</a></ul>. \n<br><br>Last Update : 12/23/2014\n</body></html>\n\n", "id": 8897.0}
