TriangulationDataStructure 3 Edge Edge The vertices and faces of the triangulations are accessed through handles iterators and circulators A handle is a type which supports the two dereference operators operator and operator The Handle concept is documented in the support library Iterators and circulators are bidirectional and non mutable The edges and facets of the triangulation can also be visited through iterators and circulators which are bidirectional and non mutable Iterators and circulators are convertible to the corresponding handles thus the user can pass them directly as

The class Triangulation 3 TriangulationTraits 3 TriangulationDataStructure 3 provides two functions to locate a given point with respect to a triangulation It provides also functions to test if a given point is inside a finite face or not Note that the class Delaunay triangulation 3 also provides a nearest vertex function Cell handle t locate Point query Cell handle start Cell handle If the point query lies inside the convex hull of the points the cell that contains the query in its interior is returned If query lies on a facet an edge or on a vertex one of the cells having query on its boundary is returned If the point query lies outside the convex hull of the points an infinite cell with vertices p q r is returned such that the tetrahedron p q r query is positively oriented the rest of the triangulation lies on the other side of facet p q r Note that locate works even in degenerate dimensions in dimension 2 resp 1 the Cell handle returned is the one that represents the facet resp edge vertex containing the query point The optional argument start is used as a starting place for the search Cell handle t locate Point query Locate type lt int li int lj Cell handle start Cell

the locate type of the query VERTEX EDGE FACET CELL or OUTSIDE CONVEX HULL if the cell is infinite and query lies strictly in it and two indices li and lj that specify the k face of the cell containing query If the k face is a cell li and lj have no meaning if it is a facet resp vertex li gives the index of the facet resp vertex and lj has no meaning if it is and edge li and lj give the indices of its vertices If the point query lies outside the affine hull of the points which can happen in case of degenerate dimensions lt is set to OUTSIDE AFFINE HULL and the cell returned has no meaning As a particular case if there is no finite vertex yet in the triangulation lt is set to OUTSIDE AFFINE HULL and locate returns the default constructed handle The optional argument start is used as a starting place for the search Bounded side t side of cell Point p Cell handle c Locate type lt int li int lj Returns a value indicating on which side of the oriented boundary of c the point p lies More precisely it returns ON BOUNDED SIDE if p is inside the cell For an infinite cell this means that p lies strictly in the half space limited by its finite facet and not containing any other point of the triangulation ON BOUNDARY if p on the boundary of the cell For an infinite cell this means that p lies on the finite facet Then lt together with li and lj give the precise location on the boundary See the descriptions of the locate methods ON UNBOUNDED SIDE if p lies outside the cell For an infinite cell this means that p does not satisfy either of the two previous conditions Precondition t dimension 3 Bounded side t side of facet Point p Facet f Locate type lt int li int lj Returns a value indicating on which side of the oriented boundary of f the point p lies ON BOUNDED

p is on the boundary of the facet For an infinite facet this means that p lies on the finite edge lt li and lj give the precise location of p on the boundary of the facet li and lj refer to indices in the degenerate cell c representing f ON UNBOUNDED SIDE if p lies outside the facet For an infinite facet this means that p does not satisfy either of the two previous conditions Precondition t

Bounded side t side of edge Point p Cell handle c Locate type lt int li Same as the previous method for edge c 1 Flips Two kinds of flips exist for a three dimensional triangulation They are reciprocal To be flipped an edge must be incident to three tetrahedra During the flip these three tetrahedra disappear and two tetrahedra appear Figure left shows the edge that is flipped as bold dashed and one of its three incident facets is shaded On the right the facet shared by the two new tetrahedra is shaded Flips are possible only under the following conditions the edge or facet to be flipped is not on the boundary of the convex hull of the triangulation the five points involved are in convex position Figure Flips The following methods guarantee the validity of the resulting 3D triangulation Flips for a 2d triangulation are not implemented yet bool t flip Edge e bool t flip Cell handle c int i int j Before flipping these methods check that edge e c i j is flippable which is quite expensive They return false or true according to this test void t flip flippable Edge e void t flip flippable Cell handle c int i int j Should be preferred to the previous methods when the edge is known to be flippable Precondition The edge is flippable bool t flip Facet f bool t flip Cell handle c int i Before flipping these methods check that facet f c i is flippable which is quite expensive They return false or true according to this test void t flip flippable Facet f void t flip flippable Cell handle c int i Should be preferred to the previous methods when the facet is known to be flippable Precondition The facet is flippable Insertions The following operations are guaranteed to lead to a valid triangulation when they are applied on a valid triangulation Vertex handle t insert Point p Cell handle start Cell handle Inserts point p in the triangulation and returns the corresponding vertex If point p coincides with an already existing vertex this vertex is returned and the triangulation remains unchanged If point p lies in the convex hull of the points it is added naturally if it lies inside a cell the cell is split into four cells if it lies on a facet the two incident cells are split into three cells if it lies on an edge all the cells incident to this edge are split into two cells If point p is strictly outside the convex hull but in the affine hull p is linked to all visible points on the convex hull to form the new triangulation See Figure If point p is outside the affine hull of the points p is linked to all the points and the dimension of the triangulation is incremented All the points now belong to the boundary of the convex hull so the infinite vertex is linked to all the points to triangulate the new infinite face See Figure The optional argument start is used as a starting place for the search Vertex handle t insert Point p Locate type lt Cell handle loc int li int lj Inserts point p in the triangulation and returns the corresponding vertex Similar to the above insert function but takes as additional parameter the return values of a previous location query See description of locate above template class InputIterator int t insert InputIterator first InputIterator last Inserts the points in the range first last Returns the number of inserted points Precondition The value type of first and last is Point The previous methods are sufficient to build a whole triangulation We also provide some other methods that can be used instead of insert p when the place where the new point p must be inserted is already known They are also guaranteed to lead to a valid triangulation when they are applied on a valid triangulation Vertex handle t insert in cell Point p Cell handle c Inserts point p in cell c Cell c is split into 4 tetrahedra Precondition t dimension 3 and p lies strictly inside cell c Vertex handle t insert in facet Point p Facet f Inserts point p in facet f In dimension 3 the 2 neighboring cells are split into 3 tetrahedra in dimension 2 the facet is split into 3 triangles Precondition t dimension 2 and p lies strictly inside face f Vertex handle t insert in facet Point p Cell handle c int i As

this edge are split into 2 tetrahedra in dimension 2 the 2 neighboring facets are split into 2 triangles in dimension 1 the edge is split into 2 edges Precondition t dimension 1 and p lies on edge e Vertex handle t insert in edge Point p Cell handle c int i int j As above inserts p in edge i j of c Precondition As above and i j Moreover i j 1 2 3 in dimension 3 i j 1 2 in dimension 2 i j 1 in dimension 1 Vertex handle t insert outside convex hull Point p Cell handle c The cell c must be an infinite cell containing p Links p to all points in the triangulation that are visible from p Updates consequently the infinite faces See Figure Precondition t dimension c and the k face represented by c is infinite and contains t Figure insert outside convex hull 2 dimensional case Vertex handle t insert outside affine hull Point p p is linked to all the points and the infinite vertex is linked to all the points including p to triangulate the new infinite face so that all the points now belong to the boundary of the convex hull See Figure This method can be used to insert the first point in an empty triangulation Precondition t dimension 3 and p lies outside the affine hull of the points Figure insert outside affine hull 2 dimensional case template class CellIt Vertex handle t insert in hole Point p CellIt cell begin CellIt cell end Cell handle begin int i Creates a new vertex by starring a hole It takes an iterator range cell begin cell end of Cell handles which specifies a hole a set of connected cells resp facets in dimension 2 which is star shaped wrt p begin i is a facet resp an edge on the boundary of the hole that is begin belongs to the set of cells resp facets previously described and begin neighbor i does not Then this function deletes all the cells resp facets describing the hole creates a new vertex v and for each facet resp edge on the boundary of the hole creates a new cell resp facet with v as vertex Then v set point p is called and v is returned This operation is equivalent to calling tds insert in hole cell begin cell end begin i v set point p Precondition t dimension 2 the set of cells resp facets in dimension 2 is connected its boundary is

geometric embedding see Section When verbose is set to true messages describing the first invalidity encountered are printed bool t is valid Cell handle c bool verbose false Checks the combinatorial validity of the cell by calling the is valid method of the TriangulationDataStructure 3 cell class Also checks the geometric validity of c if c is finite See Section When verbose is set to true messages are printed to give a precise indication of the kind of invalidity encountered advanced I O CGAL provides an interface to Geomview for a 3D triangulation See the chapter on Geomview in the Support Library manual include CGAL IO Triangulation geomview ostream 3 h istream istream is Triangulation 3 t Reads the underlying combinatorial triangulation from is by calling the corresponding input operator of the triangulation data structure class and the non combinatorial information by calling the corresponding input operators of the vertex and the cell classes Assigns the resulting triangulation to t ostream ostream os Triangulation 3 t Writes the triangulation t into os The information in the iostream is the dimension the number of finite vertices the non combinatorial information about vertices point etc the number of cells the indices of the vertices of each cell plus the non combinatorial information about each cell then the indices of the neighbors of each cell where the index corresponds to the preceding list of cells When dimension 3 the same information is stored for faces of maximal dimension instead of cells See Also TriangulationDataStructure 3 Vertex
