{"text": "MinGW C Eclipse Download and Installation Install MinGW and a new version of Eclipse to use with It MinGW means Minimalist GNU for Windows GNU is a source of open source programming tools GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix There are two parts to this handout First you will download the files needed by GNU C Then you will download a version of Eclipse that is already set up to use MinGW You may want to print these instructions before proceeding so that you can refer to them while downloading and installing MinGW and Eclipse Or just keep this document in your browser You should read each step completely before performing the action that it describes MinGW Downloading Click MinGW The following page will appear in your browser from the SourceForge web site Click the Download mingw get setup exe 86 5 kB link This file should start downloading in your standard download folder This file is only 85KB so it should download very quickly The file should appear as Terminate the window browsing the SourceForge web site Move this file to a more permanent location so that you can install MinGW and reinstall it later if necessary Start the Installation instructions directly below Installing Double click the icon The following pop up window will appear Click Run The following pop up window will appear Click Install The following pop up window will appear You can install this software anywhere but I recommend installing it in the default directory C MinGW Click Continue The following pop up window will appear showing the downloading progress After about a minute it should appear as follows Click Continue The following pop up window will appear Ensure on the left that Basic Setup is highlighted Click the three boxes indicated below mingw32 base mingw32 gcc g msys base After clicking each select Mark for selection This window should appear as follows Terminate click X on the MinGW Installation Manager I know this is weird The following pop up window should appear Click Review Change The following pop up window should appear Click Apply The following pop up window will appear showing the downloading progress After a while a few minutes to an hour depending on your download speed it should start extracting the donwloaded files A few minutes after that the following pop up window should appear Click Close Edit Path so that the MinGW and MSYSM software is findable by Eclipse Click Start Click Control Panel Click System Click Advance system settings you will see Click Enviroment Variables you will see In the System variables lower part scroll to line starting with Path and click that line IMPORTANT Even though you see a highlighted PATH in the User variables top part look for Path not CLASSPATH in the lower part to change it Click Edit Copy C MinGW bin C MinGW msys 1 bin include everything from C to and then paste it at the very start of the Variable Value text entry When done it should look like Click OK 3 times You are now ready to install Eclipse But it is probaby a good idea to reboot your machine first to ensure the new path is correct Eclipse Version 4 4 Luna The Eclipse download requires about 2 MB of disk space keep it on your machine in case you need to re install Eclipse When installed Eclipse requires an additional 2 MB of disk space Downloading Click Eclipse The top of the following page will appear in your browser In this handout we will download Eclipse Standard 4 4 for Windows 32 Bit if your computer uses Windows continue below otherwise look for the pull down list showing Windows and instead choose either Mac OS X Cocoa or Linux and then continue below It is critical that Java MinGW and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are all 64 Bit and only if your Machine OS supports 64 Bit I think it easiest to use 32 Bit for everything Click the Windows 32 Bit Operating System for your machine under the heading Eclipse IDE for C C Developers the fourth selection from the top You will see the following page don
