In\nthis paper we present a customizable retargetable compiler \nframework that determines the phase-ordering between \ntransformations dynamically based on the resource availability \nand the program region characteristics. We present some \nexperiments with ordering If-Conversion - a predicated \nexecution technique, and Speculative code motion. The results \nindicate that flexibility in the ordering of the transformations \nis important while compiling for embedded systems. Our\nfuture work includes performing experiments exploring the \nvarious phase orderings and also incorporating more \ntransformations into the EXPRESS compiler.\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Center For Embedded Computer Systems,<br> \n      Department of Information and Computer Science,<br>\n      University of California, Irvine.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "id": 16863.0}
