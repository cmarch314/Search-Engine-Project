Research Part 5 Applications 2 Paleocortical precursors Modules of the brain Each telencephalic brain area cortex hippocampus amygdala striatal complex is different in structure and operation Even constituent circuits fields CA1 vs CA3 of hippocampus central medial lateral divisions of amygdala layers of cortex can be dramatically different from each other Our models of individual brain circuits have yielded quite different operations for each region corresponding to their different circuit designs Each emergent algorithm constitutes a candidate function that can be contributed to overall brain computations Moreover still other functions arise from interaction of distinct circuits which combine in sometimes unanticipated ways Olfaction as precursor Early work in our lab focused on the olfactory system The primary olfactory cortical circuit is substantially simpler than those that process other senses such as sight sound and touch Yet the olfactory cortex aka piriform pyriform prapyriformus bears many resemblances to portions of the other primary cortices and is considered their direct evolutionary precursor Thus it may serve as a partial Rosetta stone to aid us in our long term goal of decoding the more complex neocortical areas Excitatory inhibitory interaction Excitation and inhibition in cortical circuits are very asymmetrical excitatory cells generate fast 15 msec responses and have axons that travel long distances whereas inhibitory neurons generate slower and longer responses 8 1 msec inhibit only cells in a local region and synapse on or near excitatory cell bodies strengthening their effect When inputs arrive at a group of excitatory neurons their voltages rise until a subset of them responds to a sufficiently strong input at which point their activity triggers local feedback inhibition which quiets all the cells in the inhibitory cells local region including the cells that gave rise to the inhibiton The result is a race in which the most strongly activated neurons respond and other neurons are prevented from responding via feedback inhibition This winners take all effect has been described and formalized Coultrip R Granger R and Lynch G 1992 A cortical model of winner take all competition via lateral inhibition Neural Networks 5 47 54 Simulation of Paleocortex The primary characteristics of olfactory paleocortex that have been modeled are the feedforward connections from bulb to cortex and feedback connections from cortex back to inhibitory granule cells in bulb along with the local cortical excitatory inhibitory interaction just described Operation of the simulation The paleocortical model like the biological system responds repeatedly to a stimulus eliciting rhythmic responses roughly every 2 msec or five times per second the theta EEG rhythm which is strongly in evidence in animals actively engaged in olfactory behavior Surprisingly the model generated a different response at each such cycle so that when presented with a simulated odor it generates a series of distinct cortical response patterns Analysis showed that with learning via simulated long term potentiation LTP these responses corresponded to a series of general to specific categories of the input The result was compared to standard statistical methods for hierarchical clustering and was found to have time and space costs that compared favorably with comparable algorithms in this class Ambros Ingerson J Granger R and Lynch G 199 Simulation of paleocortex performs hierarchical clustering Science 247 1344 1348 Simulation of Paleocortex Performs Hierarchical Clustering Operation of the olfactory simulation creates memories organized hierarchically which are traversed or read out in sequence from general to specific Thus for demonstration purposes the simulation was presented with a series of brief speech sounds spoken letters of the alphabet Once they were learned by the system then presentation of any letter would evoke a sequence of responses For instance presenting B to the system elicited an initial response corresponding to a spontaneously created category containing all B C D E G sounds followed by a response corresponding only to the sub category continaing unvoiced B D E followed by a response specific just to B Presenting C to the system elicited the same initial response followed by a response corresponding to the sub category of voiced C G sounds followed by a response specific just to C Granger R 2 2 Neural Computation Olfactory cortex as a model for telencephalic processing Learning

occurring time specifically at about 2 msec after onset of the odor These responses contrast sharply with those obtained from animals who are not made familiar with the task are not actively engaged
