The action of selecting each of these is controlled by the\nServers, Webs, and Links tabs on the Chimera Server.  Follow the \ninstructions below to see how to do these actions.\n</p>\n\n<H3>Selecting a Chimera Website and a particular Hyperweb</H3>\n<ol>\n    <li> Click on the Servers tab on the Chimera Server and then\n\tclick on the hostname of the Chimera Website you have \n\trunning. (Note: in this\n\tcase it is the testing machine.)\n\t\n<p>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_serverSelect.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n</p>\n\n    <li> Click the Login button to connect with the Chimera Website.\n\tNote: The display of the Chimera Server should automatically shift \n\tto the Webs tab.  \n\n<p>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/web_list.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n</p>\n\n    <li>Now select bill_web by \n\tclicking on it.  \n<p>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_webSelect.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n</p>\n\n    <li> Click the Login button to connect with the bill_web.\n\tThe display will shift again, this time to the\n\tLinks tab.\n\n<p>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_link_list.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n\tNote: There are no Links available at this time.\n</p>\n</ol>\n\n<H3>Creating Links and selecting the Active Link</H3>\n\n<p> Now you can create some links which you later use when you create \nanchors on the documents and images later in this tutorial.  For now\ndo then following in the Links tab:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li> Click the Create Link button at the bottom of the display.\n\tA dialog box will appear.  Type in the name places_to_go \n\tand click OK to create a link.\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_linkNaming.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n\n\n    <li> This creates the places_to_go link which should come up \n\ton the list of links in the Links tab.  \n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_linkCreated.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n\tAdd more links\n\tto this list if you like.  Note:  The Links listed may\n\thave a number instead of their names, this will be corrected \n\tin future versions of Chimera.\n\n    <li> Now click on the link to make it the Active Link. \n\t(Note: Once the link name is highlighted, it becomes the \n\tActive Link. Also the Deactivate button becomes enabled when \n\tthere is an active link.)\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/cs_linkActive.gif\" WIDTH=\"470\"\nHEIGHT=\"203\"></CENTER>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p> You are now ready to use a Chimera client program to start making\nanchors, connecting them to links, and executing link traversals.\n</p>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 31131.0}
