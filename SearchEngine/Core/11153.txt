For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square such as minimum spanning trees matching and traveling salesmen the sum of edge lengths is O sqrt n and the sum of dth powers of edge lengths is O log n We provide a gap theorem showing that if these bounds do not hold for a class of graphs both sums will instead be Omega n For traveling salesmen the O log n bound is tight but for some other graphs the sum of dth powers of edge lengths is O 1 BibTeX Citations Preprint of SCG version CiteSeer Beta skeletons have unbounded dilation D Eppstein Tech Rep 96 15 ICS UCI 1996 arXiv cs
