convinced that there are no links between us HOWEVER today I was visiting my folks and started to question my mother on some of the names in her family She gave me some info from her mother s side Muhlrad and some from her father s side that a cousin in Israel also researching the family tree supplied her with And if my info is of use to you perhaps I can get you in touch with that cousin for more information her name is Shulamith Bet Yannai formerly Winestock nee Citrinbaum Well I was reviewing the info and then plugged back onto your website to the broken Miller branches specifically Muellers from Strzyzow and Lezajsk and I found some common information I quote now from letter written to my mother in 1992 from that cousin in Israel As you probably know our grandfather wrote about his father Shabtai and mentioned his own grandfather and grandmother namely isaac and Chaya Tzvia He also wrote that Shabtai was born and died in Strzyzow and not in Lejansk as we thought I looked for this place at the library and at my great astonishment found a huge Yizkor book from that shtetl about 4 pages half Hebrew half Yiddish Unfortunately there is nothing left from that community since a fire burst out in 1898 and all the documents were destroyed From what our grandfather wrote it appears that when he did write those pages his mother Fruma born Licht was still alive There is also another letter from the cousin mentioning some different names Hauser Miriam Gitche Singer nee Hauser and my grandfather were first cousins And there were names of cousins Feiga Dora Kalman and Shmuel

cousin is Shulamith Bet Yannai in Jerusalem Ring any bells Well for months I ve been looking back at your site looking for updates etc One day I was reading the dedication names and cross references and ended up in the Shabsi Bukovska Yitzchak Miller Family tree and was scanning names of parents and children specifically Avrohm I came upon the name of one of his daughter Tzvetta Now it jumped off the screen for me because I ve only heard that name once before my cousin had a baby earlier this year and gave that middle name to her after her late grandmother whom she was quite close to I read on in the description and saw the names of Tzvetta s kids one of whom is Chana Geller Well this cousin I mentioned is my first cousin s wife her maiden name was Geller She was out of town for the summer so I couldn t reach her to ask her if that s her mother s name We found an invitation for that cousin s wedding about 21 years ago and saw that her mother s name is Chana Geller Could it be the same one I wondered for about 3 months Well tonight after Shabbat was over I finally got to reach this cousin Far Rockaway NY by phone threw out my left field question to her if her grandmother passed away at the listed year and went on to read the description Lo and behold yes Chana Geller is this cousin s mother Tzvetta was her grandmother and a Miller by birth I don t know if you still consider that the Broken Miller Branches from which I stem are part of the big picture and related but isn t that weird My mother was the Muller she married my dad an Adler That Adler has one sister who has one son That son married a Geller that Geller s grandmother had been a Miller at birth and on your tree I will be sending my cousin the information and the web site address for the tree she ll be delighted and interested to see it and the photo of Tzvetta that you placed with the description My cousin Sara tells me her mother Chana was born in the U S not Europe I have heard from others who saw my name

My mother's  paternal grandfather, Joseph\r\nMuller, was the son of Shabsi Muller who married Frimit Licht (I think that's \r\nhow it goes...)  My mother is from Basel, Switzerland, her parents went there \r\nafter Poland, etc. (my mom's first cousin is Shulamith Bet-Yannai in \r\nJerusalem...) Ring any bells...?\r\n     \r\nWell, for months, I've been looking back at your site, looking for updates, etc.\r\n One day, I was reading the dedication names and cross-references, and ended up\r\nin the Shabsi (Bukovska) Yitzchak Miller Family tree, and was scanning names of \r\nparents and children, specifically  Avrohm.  I came upon the name of one of his \r\ndaughter, Tzvetta.  Now, it jumped off the screen for me because I've only heard\r\nthat name once before -- my cousin had a baby earlier this year and gave that \r\nmiddle name to her after her late grandmother whom she was quite close to.  I \r\nread on in the description and saw the names of Tzvetta's kids, one of whom is \r\nChana Geller.  Well,  this cousin I mentioned is my first cousin's wife; her \r\nmaiden name was Geller.  She was out of town for the summer, so I couldn't reach\r\nher to ask her if that's her mother's name.  We found an invitation for that \r\ncousin's wedding  about 21 years ago, and saw that her mother's name is Chana \r\nGeller.  Could it be the same one? I wondered for about 3 months.\r\n     \r\nWell, tonight after Shabbat was over, I finally got to reach this cousin (Far \r\nRockaway, NY) by phone, threw out my left field question to her if her \r\ngrandmother passed away at the listed year, and went on to read the description.\r\n Lo and behold, yes! Chana Geller is this cousin's mother, Tzvetta was her\r\ngrandmother and a Miller by birth.\r\n     \r\nI don't know if you still consider that the Broken Miller Branches  (from which \r\nI stem) are part of the big picture, and related, but isn't that weird?  My \r\nmother was the Muller; she married my dad, an Adler.  That Adler has one sister \r\nwho has one son. That son married a Geller; that Geller's grandmother had been a\r\nMiller at birth and on your tree.\r\n     \r\nI will be sending my cousin the information and the web site address for the \r\ntree; she'll be delighted and interested to see it and the photo of Tzvetta that\r\nyou placed with the description. My cousin, Sara, tells me her mother, Chana, \r\nwas born in the U.S., not Europe.\r\n     \r\nI have heard from others who saw my name on the Jewish Gen. site, and the names \r\nand places I was curious about.  And yes, I did find other relatives.  Oh, how \r\nthe world is made a smaller place...\r\n     \r\nWishing you and yours all the best for the coming year.

Sara had a baby earlier this year, whom she named Adina Tzvetta.\r\n     \r\nAs for Joseph Muller... I don't know that he fits into the big tree; he'd be \r\nan offshoot from that broken Lezansk branch.  My mother is Lilli \r\nMuller-Adler; her father was Salomon Muller of Tarnow, later of Basel, \r\nSwitzerland.  Salomon's parents were Joseph and Sara(Leisten) ; Joseph's \r\nfather was Shabtai, who married Frimit Licht; Shabtai's parents were Yitchok \r\nand Chaya Tzvia.\r\n     \r\nI think my grandfather, Salomon, had written some brief Yahrzeits and \r\nnames/details in the inside cover of his siddurim and machzorim, but it's in \r\nGerman, and what my mother could make out of the information just names the \r\nchildren of Shabsi (Shabtai) and Frimit and brief outlines of who they married \r\nand number of kids.\r\n     \r\nMoishe, I'm such an amateur at this genealogy stuff, I don't even know what \r\nthose 2 references you mentioned are.  All I've done is ask my mother in the \r\npast year for names; it's her first cousin in Israel, Shulamith, who's \r\navidly pursuing this tree for years. I really have no other details, I'm \r\nsorry.  If my mother finds any other of my grandfather's papers with family \r\ninformation, I'll be sure to pass it on.  My mother has an older sister \r\nliving in Chicago (Dr. Esther Kornel), but I don't know if she has any of my \r\ngrandfather's personal papers; I doubt it, because after my grandmother \r\ndied, and my grandfather moved from Switzerland to Canada, he lived with us, \r\nuntil his death in 1965. (I'd just turned 4 at the time)\r\n     \r\nIf you've already been in touch with my mother's first cousins here in \r\nToronto, as you mentioned in a former e-mail, (ie. Ignacz-Irving, I think it \r\nwas), they must've given you info on their father, Abraham (my grandfather's \r\nbrother), that they  had.   I wouldn't even know where or how to start \r\nlooking for more info!\r\n     \r\nSincerely,\r\n     \r\nPearl\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<P><A HREF=\"hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"HOME\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=\"-2\">Last updated 8/31/00</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n\r\n", "id": 15825.0}
