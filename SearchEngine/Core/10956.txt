One way gave my previous solution four of them led to the four folds I showed you in my previous message all with more than three folds and the sixth led to this solution By the way there are also three infinite families of tetrahedra that can be folded from the triangle if you fold two of the triangle edges in half so that all three vertices meet at a point you get a shape with one remaining edge forming a continuous loop and two interior vertices at the midpoints of the original triangle The other two tetrahedron vertices can be chosen to be any two opposite points from the loop There is

was along line segments BD BE and EF Then BCD is isosceles so 2 angle BDC angle BCD 18 But also angle ADB angle BDC 18 so subtracting the two equations gives angle BDC angle BCD angle ADB so these three angles fold flat rather than making one of the corners of a tetrahedron QED One can also observe that ADB is similar to ABC BDE is isosceles and since the other tetrahedron corners must also be flat BEF is a right triangle I don t know of any similar nice property for the remaining triangle EFC This construction also makes it clear that the sharp angle of the 2 3 4 triangle is twice that of
