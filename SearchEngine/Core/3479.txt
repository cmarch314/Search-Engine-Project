I will show that after\naddding or removing points from the input, the mesh refinement algorithm\nof Bern, Eppstein, and Gilbert can recompute the output quality mesh in\nO(log&nbsp;<i>L</i>/<i>s</i>) time.  This uses the automatic\ndynamization techniques of Acar, which ensures that the dynamic\nalgorithm is no harder to implement than the static algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>In two dimensions, we can extend this to do even better: by\ndynamizing a post-processing algorithm of Har-Peled and Ungor, we can\nmaintain a mesh as small as is known how to produce in practice, at no\nadditional asymptotic cost.</p>\n\n<p>I expect this joint work with Umut Acar (TTI-C) to be of particular\ninterest to geometers, dynamic algorithmaticians, and scientific\ncomputers.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3479.0}
