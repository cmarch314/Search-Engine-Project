First, they wrote a number 1/n\nas the number n with an oval above it. This makes it difficult\nto come up with a notation for m/n without really inventing a\ncompletely new notation, which is always difficult.\n\n   Second, the unary fractions come up naturally in their method\nfor division. For example, to divide 53 by 8, they would proceed\nas follows: Begin with two columns, one headed by \"1\" and the other\nby \"8\". Double each column until just less than 53:\n               1      8\n               2     16\n               4     32\nNow start over from the 1 and 4 and halve each number until the \nsecond column is \"1\". I use () to stand for the oval that should\nreally be above the numbers in the first column:\n   1/2 =    () 2      4\n   1/4 =    () 4      2\n   1/8 =    () 8      1\nNow mark the numbers in the second column which add up to 53 (by the notion \nof binary expansion of a number, there will be a unique way to do this)\n               1      8\n               2     16  *\n               4     32  *\n   1/2 =    () 2      4  *\n   1/4 =    () 4      2\n   1/8 =    () 8      1  *\nThe corresponding marked numbers in column 1 give you your answer:\n    53 / 8  =  2 + 4 + ()2 + ()8, or 2 + 4 + 1/2 + 1/8.\nThus the notion of unary fractions, 1/n, comes up naturally from this\nalgorithm for division. (Division by numbers other than powers of 2\nmake life more interesting for the Egyptians.)\n\n   Dominic Alivastro, \"Ancient Puzzles\", suggests a third reason why \nthis use of unary fractions is good. Consider the problem Ahmes poses \nof dividing 3 loaves of bread between 5 people. We would answer \"each\nperson gets 3/5-ths of a loaf\". If we implemented our solution, we might\nthen cut 2 loaves into 3/5 | 2/5 pieces, with bread for 3 people; then\ncut one of the smaller pieces in half, giving the other two people \n2/5 + 1/5 pieces. Mathematically acceptable, but try this with kids and\nthey will insist that it is not an even division. Some have larger pieces,\nsome have smaller. Ahmes would calculate 3/5 as :\n   3/5 = ()3 + ()5 + ()15    [ = 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/15 ]\nNow cut one loaf into fifths, cut two more into thirds, then take one of\nthe 1/3-rd pieces and cut it into 5-ths (for the 1/15-th pieces), and you\ncan now distribute everyone's 3/5-ths share in a way that _looks_ equal,\nsince they will have exactly the same size pieces. (And no, I don't want\nto argue about the crust.)\n\nDarrah Chavey             -- I'm dead, Horatio.  (Hamlet)\nMath/CS Dept.             -- He's dead Jim!
