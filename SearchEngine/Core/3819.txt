In this problem, a feasible\nallocation allocates every item to at most one player.\nFor every player <I>P<sub>i</sub></I>, her utility <I>w<sub>i</sub></I>\ndepends only on the set of items she receives.  The goal is to find a\nfeasible allocation that maximizes social welfare, that is,\nmaximizing &sum;<I>w<sub>i</sub></I>(S).\n<p>\nThe author presents a rounding technique that converts a fractional LP\nsolution to a feasible allocation resulting in a 1/2 approximation.\nMore importantly the author shows this is true even when utility\nfunctions are subadditive.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3819.0}
