com Lou Coker Project Leader Teknowledge Corp lcoker teknowledge com We are employing distributed object technology to build a new generation of infrastructure for decision making In particular DARPA has formulated a strategy for a Next Generation Information Infrastructure NGII that will augment and supersede the Defense Information Infrastructure now being deployed Our company has provided the architecture and various components for this NGII We began in 1994 by embracing the CORBA architecture also known as the Object Management Architecture or OMA and then proceeded to elaborate and refine it Last year we completed development of a third version of an object web server OWS that provides means for worldwide collaborators to create modify version and partially replicate compound objects that correspond to decision products such as situation analyses and plans Because the collaboration takes place over communication paths with up to five orders of magnitude speed and reliability variations the entire system must be aware of and adaptive to variations in availability or quality of service Beginning in 1998 we have begun to decompose the OWS into more composable elementary services Later this year we will complete the first version of composable services for wide area sharing of compound objects and will provide application frameworks that simplify the task of composing and employing these more elementary capabilities Biography Frederick Hayes Roth is Chairman and CEO of Teknowledge where he has worked for 16 years since co founding the company He became Chairman and CEO in 1993 He was the company s Chief Technology Officer R D Director and Executive Vice President for Technology prior to becoming Chairman and CEO Currently Dr Hayes Roth devotes much of his time to serving as Chief Architect for the DARPA DISA Next Generation Information Infrastructure and several other programs and projects related to this These programs are intended to develop the Leading Edge Services for the U S Defense Information Infrastructure He has focused on the architecture and implementation of distributed intelligent systems for almost two decades His work along these lines includes a series of seminal and successful efforts such as the Hearsay II Speech Understanding System and its blackboard architecture opportunistic planning and meta control distributed module oriented programming supported by the ABE development environment the real time architecture for the Pilots Associate the DICAM architecture for distributed intelligent control and the DARPA Joint Task Force Reference Architecture Dr Hayes Roth has published two books and more than 1 articles and has held research faculty appointments at MIT CMU and Stanford Developing JavaBeans Components An Overview Reginald Adkins JavaBeans Team JavaSoft Sun Microsystem Inc regman eng sun com The widespread adoption of the JavaTM programing language by the Internet community creates an opportunity for developers to create a new class of interactive applications The language and environment specifications provide mechanisms for the creation and management of small reusable feature sets known as JavaBeans The goal of the Beans architecture is to define a Java Platform component model so that third party ISV s can create and ship components composed together into applications by end users Using Java RMI and Java RMI over IIOP allows for the possibility of distributing Bean functionality across platforms Biography Reginald Adkins is the JavaBeans Team Beans Development Kit BDK
