build a sense of community in ICS and to introduce new undergrads to the school some of the faculty the majors we offer and the work we do In a typical class session two faculty members will speak for half an hour each about their work and background David and Rich will then also spend a half hour addressing more general issues about college life the field of computing and strategies for success in ICS Student Expectations ICS 9 is a one unit course graded Pass Not Pass We have designed it not to require much attention outside of the class meetings but we do expect every student to attend every class If an emergency comes up and you cannot attend send an email explanation to Rich Pattis as soon as possible It s in class where the learning happens so you should be present Before the first class we will send an email to all our students describing how we will record attendance electronically For issues that come up between class meetings we have set up a forum at piazza com Sign yourself up and then participate by posting questions or supplying answers We may also have opportunities to use Piazza in class for polls and surveys You may bring your smartphone or laptop for attendance taking and for using Piazza but do not use it for other purposes unless asked by the speaker Seating Two Classrooms ICS 9 meets in two rooms at the same time BS3 12 and HSLH 1 A You are officially enrolled in one section or the other but ignore which room you re enrolled in and instead attend as follows If your class level is FR or SO come to BS3 12 If your class level is JR or SR come to HSLH 1 A This is your official class level as shown on WebReg at UCI Most weeks one faculty member will speak starting at 5 sharp and another will speak starting at 5 3 All students are required to be present for these talks The third half hour of each week s class will be devoted to broader information about college level work and more This material is aimed primarily at new students and is required for those whose class level is FR or SO We will have these discussions in BS3 12 only Upper division students from HSLH 1 A are welcome to attend this third half hour the room is just three minutes away but they may also choose to skip it Recording Attendance Bring some kind of PC or smart device to class that allows web browsing During the lecture we will ask you to navigate to this ICS 9 page and record that you are attending class by following the check in link at the top of this web page There you will see a message with instructions about how to continue You will eventually enter a word that we will announce in class It is an Academic Integrity violation to run this app and then leave class early unless you have an emergency or have arranged permission
