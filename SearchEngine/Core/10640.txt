of a single input In many cases it is possible to guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a single problem For instance it is possible to find either a 1 approximation to a 1 2 TSP defined from a graph or a n approximation to the maximum independent set of the same graph despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of approximation schemes for 1 2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations better than n1 for independent set However for some other pairs of problems such as hitting set and set cover we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no easier than solving either problem independently talk slides Windows into relational events data structures for contiguous
