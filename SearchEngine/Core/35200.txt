Interchain sheets Back to Top Interactions between the edges of protein beta sheets occur widely in the formation of protein quaternary structures in protein protein interactions and in protein aggregation In this under appreciated mode of molecular recognition between proteins hydrogen bonds form between the edges of protein beta sheets which stabilizes the partnership in conjunction with many other non covalent forces e g hydrophobic van der Waals salt bridges Inter chain beta sheet contacts play in particular a structural role in protein protein interactions that are central to healthy biological function and diseases ranging from AIDS and cancer to Alzheimer s and Huntington s diseases Beta sheets that extend over more than one protein chain can be spotted through the analysis of the atom coordinates of known protein structures or through the analysis of the corresponding secondary structure as defined by programs such as DSSP Contents primary data sources purpose Back to Top The Inter Chain Beta Sheet ICBS database identifies and characterizes all inter chain beta sheet interactions within entries in the Protein Data Bank PDB maintained by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics RCSB within the corresponding hypothetical quaternary structures that are automatically generated at the European Bioinformatics Institute EBI and that are currently available through the Protein Quaternary Structure PQS server within the Macromolecular Structure Database The data are stored in a relational database The database can be accessed through the Web and queried through a simple form Entries can be ranked according to the relative structural importance of their inter chain sheet interactions or according to other criteria The ICBS database is intended as a tool to further the study of sheet protein protein interactions identify new ICBS interactions as new structures are deposited and as old structures are revised in the Protein Data Bank help select targets for drug design Update of the ICBS database Back to Top The ICBS database is updated on a weekly basis New PDB structures are analyzed as well as new versions of already deposited structures The corresponding quaternary structures PQS entries are also analyzed The ICBS entries are then updated and any obsolete structure is removed from the database Note that there might be occasional delays between the release of a new modified PDB structure and the release of the corresponding new modified PQS structures Some PQS structures might thus appear or be updated with some delay in the ICBS database with respect to the release of the corresponding PDB entries Limitations linked to PDB files Foreseen evolution of the ICBS database Back to Top PDB files although they still represent the official public release of the PDB data as of July 2 2 contain errors and suffer from the limitations of their fixed field width format Over the past few years PDB and the EBI have revised the data PDB files contain As a result of their Data Uniformity Project revised data are displayed by the web interface that PDB offers to query its database The revised data are also available as mmCIF files deposited on a beta PDB site So far however the likely quaternary structures corresponding to PDB structures which are generated by the EBI from PDB structures are only available as PDB files Moreover mmCIF files do not yet represent the official release of the PDB structures For these reasons the current version of the ICBS database relies on PDB files This prompted a number of methodological choices linked to limitations of the PDB file format or to variations or errors in the PDB files When mmCIF files are officialy release or when an API is provided to directly query the database for PDB and for PQS entries then a new improved version of the ICBS database will be generated For further details please refer to Note on some methodological choices Note on the information extracted from PDB files Contents primary data sources purpose Methods Back to Top Obtention of structure coordinates PDB files are downloaded from the PDB ftp site PQS files are downloaded from the PQS web server We only consider the few PQS entry types that are relevant to the ICBS database namely SYMMETRY COMPLEX SPLIT SYMMETRY Please refer to the PQS documentation for a description of PQS entry types Determination of the secondary structure The DSSP Define Secondary Structure of Proteins program is then run on every retrieved file to produce a secondary structure files for each coordinates file Identification of inter chain sheets and number of hydrogen bonds The secondary structure files are then scanned to spot ladders that join residues belonging to different chains For each pair of chains that are found to interact through sheets we estimate the number of hydrogen bonds in the ICBS interface as the number of beta bridges in the ladders that contribute to the inter chain sheet interfaces See a scanned version of the DSSP paper page 19 of 21 for a definition of secondary structure elements such as hydrogen bonds bridges ladders sheets etc Note that we take into account single beta bridges i e ladders of length 1 Single beta bridges can strengthen the effect of regular ladders of length 1 and they are therefore taken into account for the computation of the ICBS index The ICBS database thus contains some proteins for which the inter chain interface is reduced to a single beta bridge and whose ICBS index is consequently very low The query interface lets users exclude ICBS entries whose ICBS interface consists solely of single beta bridges Characterization of the strength of inter chain sheets ICBS index In order to characterize and rank inter chain sheet interactions we developed a simple ICBS index This index attempts to capture the relative importance of the sheet interactions in the overall inter chain interface We first scan coordinate files and count all heavy atom contacts between chains that pair through inter chain sheets Two heavy atoms belonging to different chains are here considered to be in contact when they are less than 4 4 Angstroms apart The ICBS index is then obtained for each pair of chain by forming the ratio between the number of hydrogen bonds in the sheets between the 2 chains and the number of heavy atom contacts For readability purposes the result is multiplied by 1 The highest value over all pairs is retained for a global characterization of the ICBS interface at the level of the whole structure Homogeneity and sense of the ICBS interface For each pair of chain we determine two additional characteristics Homogeneity Two chains are considered identical when they have the same number of residues When identical chains pair through inter chain sheets their interface is considered homogeneous It is considered heterogeneous when the 2 chains are different The overall homogeneity of the interface at the level of the whole structure is derived from the homogeneity of all pairs of chains See the explanation of the Homogeneity column of the results table Orientation Depending on the parallel or anti parallel nature of the single or multiple ladders found in the inter chain sheets the interface is considered parallel anti parallel or mixed See the explanation of the Orientation column of the results table See a scanned version of the DSSP paper page 19 of 21 for a definition of parallel and antiparallel ladders and sheets Redundancy of the ICBS interface Some ICBS entries correspond to likely protein quaternary structures i e to PQS entries They can contain the same ICBS interfaces as the PDB structure they are derived from or they can contain new unique ICBS interfaces The query form lets users choose whether to display unique and or redundant entries A simple but effective redundancy criterion is used An ICBS entry corresponding to a PQS structure is considered redundant if one of the following conditions is met it represents only a part of i e has less chains than the PDB structure the ratio between the number of chains and the number of pairs of chains is the same in the PQS and in the PDB structures Note on some methodological choices that were prompted by limitations in the format of the source data or by errors and variations in the data Automatically spotting and analyzing inter chain beta bridges ladders and beta sheets in PDB files representing PDB and PQS entries is a challenging task for a number of reasons Limitations in PDB and DSSP file formats which both use fixed width fields makes it difficult to uniquely identify chains beta bridges ladders beta sheets and to correctly process large macro molecules Not all PDB files match the current PDB format In submitting PDB entries authors have used and broken a variety of rules Large files and variations or errors in file format cause some errors in the output of DSSP We have adopted a number of methodological choices with the purpose of limiting the impacts of such limitations variations or errors These choices will change when other formats become officially available for PDB structures and for the corresponding likely macro molecular structures generated at the EBI Please refer to Limitations linked to PDB files Foreseen evolution of the ICBS database for details on the current choice of source data and format and future alternatives Unique chain IDs versus non unique chain labels PDB and DSSP chain labels are one character long Upper and lower case letters digits and non alphanumerical characters are used thus providing for at least 62 unique chain identifiers However this is not sufficient for some large macro molecules in addition not all authors use non alphanumerical labels Instead of rebuilding unique ICBS chain identifiers and mapping them to non unique PDB and DSSP labels we currently ignore chains whose label has previously been used for another chain in the same entry This only affects the results of some very large PQS macro molecules As these entries consist of numerous repetitions of the same PDB asymmetric unit and of the same interfaces between them this solution is not likely to cause any unique ICBS interaction to be missed Unique beta bridge ladder and sheet IDs versus non unique labels DSSP labels beta bridges with a letter Case is used to denote the parallel or anti parallel nature of the bridge Only 26 unique identifiers are thus available in each category sheets are labeled with capital letters Therefore one theoretically would have to rebuild the whole connectivity of bridges and ladders to uniquely identify bridges ladders and sheets Instead of adopting this costly and error prone solution we created an ICBS ladder label that is very unlikely to be non unique by combining the DSSP ladder label the label of the sheet it belongs to and the labels of the two pairing chains We are thus able to count ladders and hydrogen bonds and to determine the interface orientation for each pair of chains This method might cause some overestimations in the number of ladders in the probably rare cases where a same ladder joins more than 2 chains This would however be of no consequence as far as the data we display in the database interface are concerned HETATM PDB rows and bridges that occur in non standard groups HETATM rows of PDB files specify non standard groups that sometimes contain amino acid residues Such residues are sometimes found to participate in bridges with other residues belonging to standard chains specified in ATOM rows or to other non standard groups Some of these bridges are relevant to the characterization of inter chain interfaces However because of the numerous variations in the way HETATM rows were used and placed in PDB files taking into account HETATM rows in the analysis of inter chain sheets has a number of undesirable effects For the time being we therefore only consider beta bridges and atom contacts between residues that belong to standard chains i e residues whose coordinates are provided in PDB ATOM rows As a consequence we might under or over estimate the ICBS index for a few ICBS entries and we might miss a few proteins in which ICBS interactions would occurr only between residues specified in HETATM rows Please refer to the PDB documentation for details on ATOM and HETATM PDB records Case of very large entries that break DSSP format In some rare cases the DSSP sequential number that idenfies residues can be higher than 9999 As the BP1 and BP2 DSSP fields that specify bridges partners are 4 character long partners corresponding to a sequential number 1 cause DSSP to output rows that break its own format There is no 1 safe way of resolving the problem When such cases are encountered we simply ignore the corresponding DSSP rows As a consequence we might occasionally miss some inter chain sheet interactions Case of inconsistent DSSP partner and or secondary structure assignment When the output of the DSSP programs specifies that a residue R1 pairs with another residue R2 through a beta bridge one would expect that residue R2 pair with R1 However this is not the case in some cases presumably due to precision or secondary structure assignment problems in the DSSP program Given our current method to count partnerships in ladders and inter chain interfaces i e counting every partnership twice once for R1 once for R2 and then dividing by 2 this DSSP problem might cause an underestimation of the number of Hydrogen bonds and of the ICBS index To limit the impact of this rare problem we increase the number of any fractional number of partnerships to the next higher integer 2 Query form Back to Top Query parameters can be specified in the ICBS query form for the following criteria PDB header name Entries containing the entered word or text fragment in their PDB header name will be selected PDB ID Enter or paste one or more space separated PDB codes Spaces and new line characters will be ignored Entries corresponding to the PDB code s will be selected Entry origin The ICBS database contains entries corresponding to PDB structures as well as hypothetical quaternary structures derived from them One can select entries corresponding to one to the other or to both categories PQS entries While some entries corresponding to PQS structures contain unique ICBS interactions that are not present in the corresponding PDB structure some do not and are thus redundant The query form lets one select which categories of PQS entries should be displayed only entries with unique ICBS interactions only entries with ICBS interactions that are redundant with respect to the corresponding PDB structure both Please note that this selection criterion does not exclude entries based on protein sequence redundancy it is for ICBS interface redundancy Ladder length The ICBS interface between two chains may contain single beta bridges ladders of length 1 only One can display entries for which at least one pair of chains has an ICBS interface involving ladders of length greater than 1 entries for which only single bridge ladders occur both categories Please note that the interface between two chains can comprise several single beta bridges Please refer to the Methods section for details on secondary structure determination Journal Select one or more abbreviated Journal names Entries whose PDB structure s primary citation was published in this these journal s will be selected Please see the note

Results pages Back to Top General description Back to Top Tabulation of results The results of a query are presented in a table Some columns reproduce pieces of information extracted from PDB files such as the deposition date of the PDB structure Note that several ICBS entries can correspond to a same PDB code and therefore share the same PDB information Other columns present global information that characterizes the inter chain sheet interfaces found in the protein Lastly some columns present detailed information on each pair of chains that interact through sheets Navigation from page to page The display of query results is broken up into a number of pages The number of results per page can be adjusted in the query form Results pages can be accessed using the controls available in the navigation section of the page Context specific help Popup legends can be obtained by positioning the mouse over each title cell Clicking on the title of a cell brings up a help topic for the corresponding column Sorting by column Controls buttons are available in most title cells to sort results according to the current column by ascending or descending order alphabetical or numerical depending on the column Running a new query To run a new query from a results page click on the Query link at the top of the page Note on the information extracted from PDB files Back to Top Some pieces of data in the ICBS database are derived from PDB files The web interface that the PDB offers to query PDB structures does not rely on these files but on an improved and expanded data set that is not yet publicly available as an official release For some entries you might therefore notice some discrepancies between what the ICBS database shows and what the PDB query interface returns For instance many original PDB files are missing the primary citation record or have this information placed under a wrong section of the file Such missing citation problems have been fixed in the improved data set but not in the PDB files themselves Typically the ICBS Journal column will show a missing primary citation for such entries While we tried to fix some common errors found in PDB files e g handling the many variations or errors in Journal abbreviations as explained below fixing problems such as missing primary citations records and duplicating the results will only be achieved when we will use improved primary sources The pieces of data extracted from PDB files are still considered helpful to filter and sort the query results Each ICBS entry has a link to the corresponding improved PDB entry Users can thus verify the corresponding PDB information e g check whether a primary citation is actually missing The primary citation record when present in PDB files often contains errors Instead of displaying the journal name they contain as is we use the journal abbreviation used by the Journal Citation Reports Column specific help Back to Top The content of each column of the results table is described below PDB header name This columns displays part of the header of the PDB file Names are usually generic To obtain more specific information on the coumpound please use the

install RASMOL or modify display options click here ICBS ID ICBS This column displays the unique identifier of the entry in the ICBS database The identifier is a PDB code when the entry corresponds to a PDB structure a PDB code followed by an underscore and a number when the entry corresponds to a hypothetical quaternary structure derived from a PDB structure A indicates a unique structure a 1

the ICBS entry in yyyy mm dd format Technique This columns displays the experimental technique that was used to determine the coordinates of the PDB structure corresponding to the ICBS entry ICBS Index Index This columns displays the index value that characterizes the overall strength of the inter chain sheet interactions in the protein structure Index values are computed for every pair of chains where inter chain sheets occur The maximum value over all pairs is retained to characterize the overall strength The higher the value the higher the importance of the inter chain sheets in the interface between chains For details on the computation of the ICBS index see Characterization of the strength of inter chain sheets ICBS index Homogeneity of the ICBS interface Hom This column displays the overall homogeneity of the ICBS interactions within a structure The interface is considered homogeneous when all pairs of chains that interact through inter chain sheets contain identical chains heterogeneous when all pairs contain chains that are different mixed when both homogeneous and heterogeneous pairs are found The following 2 character codes are used for the homogeneity homogeneous only chains that are identical pair heterogeneous only chains that are different pair mixed both identical and different chains pair within the structure See Homogeneity and sense of the ICBS interface for an explanation of the simple identity criterion retained here sheet orientation Sense This column shows the overall orientation of the ICBS interface The following codes are used parallel all the ladders between between all pairing chains are parallel antiparallel all the ladders between all pairing chains are antiparallel mixed there are both parallel and antiparallel ladders between chains Total number of protein chains Chains This column displays the total number of protein chains in the structure Total number of residues Res This column displays the total number of residues that are found in standard protein chains Residues belonging to non standard groups i e corresponding to HETATM rows in the PDB file are not counted Consequently the number displayed in this column does not always correspond to the number of residues displayed in the PDB query interface and or the corresponding PDB files and or the corresponding DSSP files Please see the note on the information extracted from PDB files for an explanation of other possible discrepancies between ICBS columns and what the web interface to the PDB database displays Pairing chains Pairs This column shows both the name of the protein chains that pair through inter chain sheets and the homogeneity of the pair i e whether the chains are identical or not Chains are represented by their PDB or PQS one letter code as specified in the coordinate file Note that when a quaternary structure corresponds to the assembly of several copies of a PDB structure the chains are renamed in the coordinate file so that each chain is uniquely identified The homogeneity of a pair is displayed as a 2 character code inserted between the chain identifiers The homogeneity codes are as follows homogeneous the two chains in the pair are identical heterogeneous the two chains in the pair are different See Homogeneity and sense of the ICBS interface for an explanation of the simple identity criterion retained
