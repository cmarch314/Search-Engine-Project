{"text": "R Lab 3 Assignment It will help to review last week s discussion on probability distributions and data visualization before attempting this lab assignment Instructions This is a pair programming assignment so find a partner to work with at the beginning of discussion You must work with a different partner than the partner you worked with for R Lab 1 and R Lab 2 You will turn in one lab assignment between the two of you and both of you will receive the same score Use one laptop between the two of you and take turns being the driver and the navigator If there are an odd number of students in discussion or you cannot find a partner see your TA If you do not attend discussion you must find a partner to work with outside of class The TA will pass around a lab attendance sheet on which you should write your name and your partner s name You must submit your lab assignment through the EEE Dropbox tool following the instructions found here A separate dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments This lab assignment is due Wednesday Nov 19 by 11am You must include all relevant R code used to answer the questions Partner evaluation forms will be available online via EEE Survey after completing and turning in the lab assignment Filling out the partner evaluation form is required of each student submitting a lab assignment Evaluations will be kept confidential your partner will never see what you wrote in your evaluation Problem 1 Binomial Distribution Exploration Let X be the number of heads in 1 tosses of a fair coin Use R to calculate the probability of getting at least 5 heads that is 5 or more Use R to calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 heads Use R to calculate the probability of getting between 4 and 6 heads inclusive Let X be the number of heads in 1 tosses of a fair coin Use R to calculate the probability of getting at least 5 heads that is 5 or more Use R to calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 heads Use R to calculate the probability of getting between 4 and 6 heads inclusive Let X be the number of heads in 1 tosses of a fair coin Use R to calculate the probability of getting at least 5 heads that is 5 or more Use R to calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 heads Use R to calculate the probability of getting between 4 and 6 heads inclusive Describe any trends you see in the answers you gave to parts a c Problem 2 Hypergeometric Distribution Exploration Our book defines the Hypergeometric distribution in terms of parameters A B and n with probability function Look up the help file for the Hypergeometric distribution in R R defines the Hypergeometric distribution in terms of parameters m n and k Express each parameter from the book A B and n in terms of the parameters used by R m n and k Recall the capture recapture sampling problem from Homework 3 Suppose you have a population of 5 deer and 85 of those deer have been marked You take a random sample of 2 deer Let X be the number of marked deer in your sample Use R to calculate the following probabilities Pr X 5 Pr X 5 or X 8 Pr X 3 Pr X 3 Pr X 6 Pr X 6 Problem 3 Central Limit Theorem The Central Limit Theorem Theorem 6 3 1 in our textbook is a famous result that is the basis of a large number of statistical methods and we will prove this theorem in Chapter 6 For now you are going to perform a simulation that will demonstrate the results of this theorem Your simulation should do the following Choose a probability distribution other than the normal distribution from which to generate data This can be any of the probability distributions introduced in last week s discussion other than the normal distribution Generate 1 random values from your chosen distribution Create a histogram of these 1 values with a density plot overlaid Generate 1 random samples of size n 5 from your chosen distribution use a for loop For each sample calculate the sample mean using the mean function in R so in the end you have a vector of 1 sample means Create a histogram of these 1 sample means with a density plot overlaid Repeat part c for random samples of size n 1 n 25 and n 1 Write a few sentences describing what happens to the distributions of sample means as the sample size increases as n increases what happens to the shape of the histogram the spread variability of the sample means the center mean of the sample means Stats 12 A Index", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~staceyah/120A/labs/Lab3.html", "title": "lab 3: assignment", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta content=\"text/html;
