Understanding\nthe origins of expression differences is complicated by the fact that\norganismal morphology and gene regulatory networks could potentially vary even\nbetween closely related species. To assess the scope of such changes, we used\nhigh-resolution imaging methods to measure mRNA expression in blastoderm\nembryos of Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila pseudoobscura and assembled these\ndata into cellular resolution atlases, where expression levels for 13 genes in\nthe segmentation network are averaged into species-specific, cellular\nresolution morphological frameworks. We demonstrate that the blastoderm embryos\nof these species differ in their morphology in terms of size, shape, and number\nof nuclei. We present an approach to compare cellular gene expression patterns\nbetween species, while accounting for varying embryo morphology, and apply it\nto our data and an equivalent dataset for Drosophila melanogaster. Our analysis\nreveals that all individual genes differ quantitatively in their\nspatio-temporal expression patterns between these species, primarily in terms\nof their relative position and dynamics. Despite many small quantitative\ndifferences, cellular gene expression profiles for the whole set of genes\nexamined are largely similar. This suggests that cell types at this stage of\ndevelopment are conserved, though they can differ in their relative position by\nup to 3\u20134 cell widths and in their relative proportion between species by as\nmuch as 5-fold. Quantitative differences in the dynamics and relative level of\na subset of genes between corresponding cell types may reflect altered\nregulatory functions between species. Our results emphasize that\ntranscriptional networks can diverge over short evolutionary timescales and\nthat even small changes can lead to distinct output in terms of the placement\nand number of equivalent cells.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/Fowlkes_PLOS_2011/Fowlkes_PLOS_2011.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nCharless Fowlkes, Kelly Eckenrode, Meghan Bragdon, Miriah Meyer, Zeba Wunderlich, Lisa Simirenko, Cris Luengo&nbsp;Hendriks, Soile Ker\u00e4nen, Clara, Henriquez, David Knowles, Mark Biggin, Michael Eisen, and Angela DePace.\nA conserved developmental patterning network produces quantitatively different output in multiple species of drosophila.\n<em>PLoS Genetics</em>, 7:e1002346, 2011.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@article{<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fowlkes_PLOS_2011,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = {Fowlkes, Charless and Eckenrode, Kelly and Bragdon, Meghan and Meyer, Miriah and Wunderlich, Zeba and Simirenko, Lisa and Luengo Hendriks, Cris and Ker{\\\"a}nen, Soile and Henriquez, Clara, and Knowles, David and Biggin, Mark and Eisen, Michael and DePace, Angela},<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journal = \"PLoS Genetics\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2011\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue = \"10\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"A Conserved Developmental Patterning Network Produces Quantitatively Different Output in Multiple Species of Drosophila\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volume = \"7\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pages = \"e1002346\"<br>\n}<br>\n<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2015 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2977.0}
