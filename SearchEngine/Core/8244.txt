Millions of people network across the Internet to share, build relationships, participate, engage, buy, sell or fulfill whatever their personal motives might be. We believe that by using the enormous reach of mobile phones equipped with myriads of sensors, combined with Internet of Things, and current powerful computing infrastructure, the next generation of networks can become a powerful force for individual well-being and economic growth by enabling people to gain timely personalized access to essential life resources like healthcare, transportation, water, and markets.
