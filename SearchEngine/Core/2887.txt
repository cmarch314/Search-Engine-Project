of Invited Talks Michael Bernstein Crowd Powered Systems slides Abstract Crowd powered systems combine computation with human intelligence drawn from large groups of people connecting and coordinating online These hybrid systems enable applications and experiences that neither crowds nor computation could support alone Unfortunately crowd work is error prone and slow making it difficult to incorporate crowds as first order building blocks in software systems I introduce computational techniques that decompose complex tasks into simpler verifiable steps to improve quality and optimize work to return results in seconds These techniques advance crowdsourcing into a platform that is reliable and responsive to the point where crowds can be used in interactive systems In this talk I will present two crowd powered systems to illustrate these ideas The first Soylent is a word processor that uses paid micro contributions to aid writing tasks such as text shortening and proofreading Using Soylent is like having access to an entire editorial staff as you write The second system Adrenaline is a camera that uses crowds to help amateur photographers capture the exact right moment for a photo It finds the best smile and catches subjects in mid air jumps all in realtime These systems point to a future where social and crowd intelligence are central elements of interaction software and computation Bio Michael Bernstein is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University where he directs the Human Computer Interaction group and is a Robert N Noyce Family Faculty Scholar His research in human computer interaction focuses on the design of crowdsourcing and social computing systems This work has received Best Paper awards and nominations at premier venues in human computer interaction and social computing ACM UIST ACM CHI ACM CSCW AAAI ISWSM Michael was awarded the George M Sprowls Award for best doctoral thesis in Computer Science at MIT He holds Ph D and masters degrees in Computer Science from MIT and a B S in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University Evgeniy Gabrilovich Crowdsourcing knowledge one billion facts at a time ABSTRACT According to the Knowledge Principle formulated by Lenat and Feigenbaum 1991 computer programs need to know a great deal about the world in order to perform well in complex tasks However building world scale knowledge bases cannot yet be fully automated and is still critically dependent on humans for knowledge collection and curation In this talk we will describe our work on using crowdsourcing to make Google s Knowledge Graph and its extension Knowledge Vault more comprehensive and accurate In particular we will discuss Quizz a new gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising campaigns effectively leveraging for free the targeting capabilities of existing publicly available ad placement services We demonstrate that the cost of our approach is below that of hiring workers through paid crowdsourcing platforms while offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over the planet and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not typically available through existing labor marketplaces Bio Dr Evgeniy Gabrilovich is a senior staff research scientist at Google where he works on knowledge discovery from the web Prior to joining Google in 2 12 he was a director of research and head of the natural language processing and information retrieval group at Yahoo Research Evgeniy is an ACM Distinguished Scientist 2 12 and is a recipient of the 2 1 Karen Sparck Jones Award for his contributions to natural language processing and information retrieval He served as an area chair or senior program committee member at numerous major conferences including SIGIR WWW WSDM AAAI IJCAI ACL EMNLP CIKM ICDM and ICWSM He has organized a number of workshops and taught multiple tutorials at SIGIR ACL WWW WSDM ICML IJCAI AAAI CIKM and EC Evgeniy earned his PhD in computer science from the Technion Israel Institute of Technology Devavrat Shah Collaborative Decision Making The process of making decisions amongst stake holders with potentially different views and limited information is omnipresent examples include democratic policy making business operations and even decision of dining venue amongst friends Efficient automation of collaborative decision making requires developing a useful human interface to seek information b statistical model to capture human uncertainty and c efficient inference algorithm We have develop such a framework in the context of two scenarios micro task crowd sourcing and rank aggregation We shall discuss the associated statistical models algorithms and their information optimality This is based on joint works with Ammar Ammar David Karger Sahand Negahban and Sewoong Oh Arpita Ghosh Incentive design for crowdsourcing A game theoretic approach slides The Web is increasingly centered around the collective effort of the crowds with contributions ranging from user generated content and social media to Citizen Science projects and crowd based peer grading and peer learning in online education But every crowdsourcing based system relies on users actually participating and making high quality contributions to function effectively How can we design systems so that self interested users with their own costs and benefits to participation are properly incentivized to participate and contribute with high effort We discuss a game theoretic framework for incentive design in crowdsourcing where potential contributors are modeled as self interested agents who strategically choose whether or not to participate and how much effort to expend in response to the incentives offered by the system We illustrate the game theoretic approach via the problem of learning the qualities of online content from viewer feedback here a learning algorithm needs to not only quickly identify the best contributions but also simultaneously create incentives for attention motivated users to make high quality contributions leading to a multi armed bandit problem where the number and success probabilities of the arms of the bandit are endogenously determined in response to the learning algorithm Dengyong Zhou Algorithmic Crowdsourcing slides Page generated 2 13 12 14 17 26 53 PST by
