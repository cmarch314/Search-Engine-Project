Assuming you mean that the version=2.1\n| really refers to a collection of resources, I'll assume you can add a\n| symbolic link to version 2.0 of logo.gif into the version=2.1 collection.\n| At this point, let me introduce resource C.html, which, like A.html, has\n| three versions, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.1.  As you might imagine, C.html also\n| includes logo.gif, but C.html is an older page which has not been updated\n| recently, and hence includes logo.gif version 1.0. So the URL for C.html\n| is:\n|\n| <a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html\">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html</a>\n|\n| Utilizing the solution of adding a symbolic link to logo.gif, version 1.0\n| into collection \"version=2.1\", we suddenly realize that a symbolic link to\n| logo.gif already exists (left over from adding the link to version 2.0 of\n| logo.gif for A.html version 2.1).  This is a problem.\n\nYour examples are confusing versions (generically) and revision numbers.\nRevisions are usually file-specific.  That is, each file has its own\nindependent revision space.  Versions are more generic, and include\nsymbolic labels (the example I used) which occupy a separate namespace\nfrom revisions.  Thus\n\n\t<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/version=best/A.html\">http://foo.bar.com/version=best/A.html</a>\n\t<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/version=best/B.html\">http://foo.bar.com/version=best/B.html</a>\n\nMay get revision 2.1 of A.html and 2.0 of B.html.  Surfing works.\n\n| I strongly feel the text/config MIME type approach is the best one for\n| handling browsing of collections of versioned objects.\n\nBut not in version-unaware clients!\n\nChristopher\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0090.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0088.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0083.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0090.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "id": 34867.0}
