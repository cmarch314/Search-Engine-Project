We design general temporal languages supported by specialized efficient \r\ninference procedures. The contribution is in combining the existing logic-based temporal\r\nreasoning languages with the existing temporal constraint models, and in designing\r\nnew efficient inference algorithms for the combined languages. We explore a speciffic\r\ncombination of Datalog, a polynomial fragment of logic programming, with \r\nTemporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems (TCSP). To render this combination meaningful,\r\nattention is given to the formal syntax, semantics and the inference algorithms \r\nemployed. We address some historical challenges relevant to the introduction of time\r\nand constraints into logic programming.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dissertation surveys and develops new and improved temporal constraint\r\nprocessing algorithms. When processing traditional Constraint Satisfaction Problems\r\n(CSP), path-consistency (PC) algorithms are polynomial. We demonstrate that when\r\nprocessing temporal constraints, PC is exponential, and thus does not scale up. To\r\nremedy this problem, two new polynomial algorithms are introduced: Upper Lower\r\nTightening (ULT) and Loose Path Consistency (LPC). These algorithms are complete\r\nfor a class of problems, called the STAR class. The empirical evaluation of these\r\nalgorithms demonstrates a substantial performance improvement (up to six orders\r\nof magnitude) relative to other algorithms. We also demonstrate the existance of a\r\nphase transition for TCSPs.</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"R75.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"R75.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 4774.0}
