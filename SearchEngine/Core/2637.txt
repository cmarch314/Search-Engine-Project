{"text": "WINTER QUARTER 2 Information and Computer Science UC Irvine ICS 141 Course Reference PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES Instructor David G Kay 4 8E Computer Science 949 824 5 72 kay uci edu Course goals The universe of programming languages is much broader than C and Java nor are those languages the best ones to use in every programming situation In this course we will explore a broad range of approaches to programming the technical principles and characteristics of different programming languages and the issues that programming language designers must consider which will prepare you for ICS 142 which covers compilers Prerequisite courses and concepts We expect each student to have completed the prerequisite courses ICS 23 and ICS 51 and to understand the basics of symbolic logic propositional and predicate calculus from a course like Math 6B We also expect you to have these basic computing skills Searching and browsing the Web reading and sending Email downloading files and viewing and printing PDF Adobe Acrobat documents Meeting place and times Lecture meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 to 12 2 in PSCB 12 Our teaching assistants Linda Giang lhgiang uci edu and Amanda Hui huia uci edu will be available in the third floor lab CS 364 as follows Mondays 8 to 9 5 Amanda 1 to 11 5 Linda and 2 to 3 Linda Tuesdays 2 to 3 Amanda Thursdays 5 to 6 Amanda Fridays 2 to 4 Linda Linda will lead the discussion section which meets Fridays from 1 to 1 5 in Social Science Lab 128 Office hours I will be in or near my office during these scheduled hours during which course related matters will have first priority Tuesdays from 3 to 4 and Thursdays from 1 to 3 Of course emergencies may come up but I will try to give advance notice of any change If I m not immersed in something else I ll be glad to answer short questions whenever I m in my office so feel free to drop by any time I ll also be happy to make appointments for other times during the week Questions and announcements You can usually get a response to your course related questions within a few hours perhaps a bit longer on the weekends by sending electronic mail to the ID ics141 uci edu This goes to both the TAs and the instructor so whoever reads it first can respond If you need to reach one of us individually our individual IDs appear above We may also send course announcements by Email to the official course mailing list so you should check your Email regularly Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar has for you your UCInet ID If you prefer to read your Email on another account you should set your UCInet account to forward your Email to your preferred account you can do this on the web at http phwww cwis uci edu cgi bin phupdate This course has a home page at http e3 uci edu w 36181 which you can reach more mnemonically from http www ics uci edu kay the instructor s home page http e3 uci edu w w3m3 36181 holds an archive of official course Email and a course Note Board for student to student discussions is available at http e3 uci edu w 36181 NB We don t use a news group for this course Labs and lab hours For your computer based work in this class you may use the ICS open lab in CS 364 The machines there are available on a first come first served basis The lab is open most of the time for details about hours and other policies see http www ics uci edu lab Note in particular that all ICS labs are closed on university holidays Most of our work will use Windows NT but some may use Unix if you re not familiar with Unix you may wish to consult OAC s Unix guide http www oac uci edu help manuals uci unix guide Textbook Concepts of Programming Languages 4th edition by Robert W Sebesta You can download PDF or PowerPoint slides for each chapter from ftp ftp aw com cseng authors sebesta concepts4e Course structure Homework assignments some in the lab and some with pencil and paper 3 of the course grade One midterm given in lecture on Thursday February 1 3 One final exam on Tuesday March 21 from 1 3 a m to 12 3 p m 4 One optional programming languages web page details of which are available below Students pages from Fall 1999 are at http e3 uci edu 36258f99 PL We will determine final grades neither on a formal curve with equal numbers of As and Fs Bs and Ds and so on nor on a fixed straight scale We will guarantee that overall scores over 9 will receive an A or better scores over 8 a B or better and scores over 7 a C or better but the actual cutoffs may be lower The homeworks should give you experience applying and understanding the concepts of the course The ultimate answer is just how you know you ve done it correctly what s more important is the process you follow to get the answer because that s where the learning takes place We expect that you will work with the TA and each other within reason see below to gain that understanding We expect everyone to have the right answers and know how they reached them so we expect most homework scores to be high so long as the assignments are completed thoroughly and carefully We expect you to help your classmates with the mechanics of the new and unfamiliar programming languages and environments you ll be using Discussions among students about language features and course concepts are not only permitted they are expected To avoid running afoul of the department s policies on academic honesty however you should be careful not to copy anybody else s work either on paper or electronically If you cannot produce the correct results yourself without a copy of someone else s answers you don t understand the concepts well enough to get a satisfactory score on the exams What you must do this week to get started in ICS 141 If you do not have a UCInet ID an account on the EA system for Email get one See http www oac uci edu computing activate html If you do not have an ICS account for access to Windows NT and Unix get one See http www ics uci edu lab procedures activate html Give a snapshot of yourself with your name written on the back to your TA This will help us learn your names quickly This is not just for fun it s a course requirement Also turn in your signed Questionnaire to your TA in discussion section Good advice and helpful hints Check your electronic mail regularly this is an official channel for course announcements Make every effort to attend the lectures we will make important announcements and sometimes cover material that isn t found in the textbook It s not fair to ask the TAs simply to repeat lecture material you missed though of course they will answer questions about it Attend your discussion section too assignments will be distributed discussed and collected there exams will be reviewed there and you can ask more questions there than you can in lecture Discussion section is where you will get advice and information specific to the assignments missing your section is like doing the assignments with both hands tied behind your back Don t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you Always keep your own copy of each assignment both on diskette and on paper if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle or if a file server in the lab should crash which has happened we ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily If you find yourself having trouble or getting behind speak with your TA or the instructor But never take the shortcut of copying someone else s work and turning it in the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment The ICS department takes academic honesty very seriously for a more complete discussion see the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty issues http www ics uci edu ucounsel
