These authors show a deterministic 2.61803-competitive\nalgorithm for this problem, and show that no algorithm achieves a\nlower competitive ratio. We introduce a new variant of scheduling\nwith rejection where the accepted jobs may be be scheduled\npreemptively as in Chen, van Vliet and Woeginger ESA`94. We show\nthat with preemption it is possible to do better. We present a\ndeterministic algorithm for preemptive multiprocessor scheduling\nwith rejection and show that it is 2.38743-competitive.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4120.0}
