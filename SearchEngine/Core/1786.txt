2 9 2pmLocationDBH 4 11 SpeakerUtkarsh Srivastava Senior Research Scientist Yahoo TitlePig Building High Level Dataflows over Map ReduceAbstractInternet companies routinely capture and analyze large data sets using the obtained insights to guide product design For such large data analysis programmers have flocked to the Map Reduce programming model that is simple scalable and at the same time extremely versatile The explicit dataflow programming style of Map Reduce is preferred by many over the high level declarative style of SQL However the map reduce paradigm is too low level and rigid leaving the users to write a lot of custom code for common operations such as filter join etc and for dealing with multi step and branching dataflows Such custom code is hard to reuse and maintain and also impedes optimizations I will talk about the design and implementation of Pig a high level dataflow system that aims at a sweet spot between the declarative style of SQL and the procedural style of Map Reduce Pig offers SQL style high level data manipulation constructs which can be assembled in an explicit dataflow and interleaved with custom Map and Reduce style functions or executables Pig programs are compiled into sequences of Map Reduce jobs and executed in the Hadoop Map Reduce environment Both Pig and Hadoop are open source projects administered by the Apache Software Foundation

Ramakrishnan Chief Scientist for Audience Cloud Computing Yahoo TitleCloud Data Serving Key Value Stores to DBMSsAbstractData backed web applications have stringent availability performance and partition tolerance requirements that are difficult sometimes even impossible to meet using conventional database management systems On the other hand they typically are able to trade off consistency to achieve their goals This has led to the development of specialized key value stores which are now used widely in virtually every large scale web service On the other hand most web services also require capabilities such as indexing provided by a DBMS We are witnessing an evolution of data serving as systems builders seek to balance these trade offs In this talk I will survey some of the solutions that have been developed including Amazon s S3 and SimpleDB and Yahoo s PNUTS and discuss the challenges in building such systems as cloud services providing elastic data serving capacity to developers along with appropriately balanced consistency availability performance and partition tolerance Speaker BioRaghu Ramakrishnan is Chief Scientist for Audience and Cloud Computing at Yahoo and

11 SpeakerJingren Zhou Researcher MicrosoftTitleSCOPE Parallel Data Processing of Massive Data SetsAbstractCompanies providing cloud scale services have an increasing need to store and analyze massive data sets such as search logs and click streams For cost and performance reasons processing is typically done on large clusters of shared nothing commodity machines It is imperative to develop a programming model that hides the complexity of the underlying system but provides flexibility by allowing users to extend functionality to meet a variety of requirements In this talk we present a new declarative and extensible scripting language SCOPE Structured Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution targeted for this type of massive data analysis at Microsoft The language is designed for ease of use with no explicit parallelism while being amenable to efficient parallel execution on large clusters SCOPE borrows several features from SQL Data is modeled as sets of rows composed of typed columns The select statement is retained with inner joins outer joins and aggregation allowed Users can easily define their own functions and implement their own versions of operators extractors parsing and constructing rows from a file processors row wise processing reducers group wise processing and combiners combining rows from two inputs SCOPE supports nesting of expressions but also allows a computation to be specified as a series of steps in a manner often preferred by programmers We also describe how scripts are compiled and optimized into efficient parallel execution plans and executed on large clusters Dec 4 2 9 What We Got Right What We Got Wrong The Lessons I Learned Building a Large Scale DBMS for XML Mary Holstege Principal Engineer Mark Logic Details Slides Video

Agrawal Professor of Computer Science UC Santa Barbara Details Slides Video 4 2 MB Date and TimeMay 7 2 1 2pmLocationDBH 4 11 SpeakerDivy Agrawal Professor of Computer Science UC Santa BarbaraTitleData in the Cloud New Challenges or More of the Same AbstractOver the past two decades database and systems researchers have made significant advances in the development of algorithms and techniques to provide data management solutions that carefully balance the three major requirements when dealing with critical data high availability scalability and data consistency However over the past few years the data requirements in terms of availability and scalability from Internet scale enterprises that provide services and cater to millions of users has been unprecedented Current proposed solutions to scalable data management driven primarily by prevalent application requirements significantly downplay the data consistency requirements and instead focus on very high availability and almost unlimited scalability to support data rich applications for millions to tens of millions of users In particular the newer data management systems limit consistent access only at the granularity of single objects rows or keys thereby significantly trading off consistency in order to achieve very high scalability and availability But the growing popularity of cloud computing the resulting shift of a large number of Internet applications to the cloud and the quest towards providing data management services in the cloud has opened up the challenge for designing data management systems that provide consistency guarantees at a granularity which goes beyond single rows and keys In this talk we analyze the design choices that allowed modern scalable data management systems to achieve orders of magnitude higher levels of scalability compared to traditional databases With this understanding we highlight some design principles for data management systems providing scalable and consistent data management as a service in the cloud We conclude the talk by presenting results from two prototype systems which strike a middle ground between the two radically different data management architectures traditional database management systems where the data is treated as a whole versus modern key value stores where data is treated as a collection of independent granules Speaker BioDr Divy Agrawal serves on the faculty of Computer Science at the University of California at Santa Barbara His research interests are in the areas of distributed systems databases and large scale information systems such as data warehouses digital libraries and other data information rich environments Nov 12 2 1 Programming and Debugging Large Scale Data Processing WorkflowsChris Olston Research Scientist Yahoo Details Slides Video 4 2 MB Date and TimeNov 12 2 1 3pmLocationDBH 3 11 Speaker Chris Olston Research Scientist Yahoo TitleProgramming and Debugging Large Scale Data Processing WorkflowsAbstractThis talk gives an overview of some work on large scale data processing I have done with my Yahoo collaborators The first half describes two data processing systems I helped develop PIG a dataflow programming environment and Hadoop based runtime and NOVA a workflow manager for Pig Hadoop The second half focuses on debugging and looks at what can be done before during and after execution of a data processing operation Pig s automatic EXAMPLE DATA GENERATOR is used before running a Pig job to get a feel for what it will do enabling certain kinds of mistakes to be caught early and cheaply The algorithm behind the example generator performs a combination of sampling and synthesis to balance several key factors realism conciseness and completeness of the example data it produces INSPECTOR GADGET is a framework for creating custom tools that monitor Pig job execution We have implemented a dozen user requested tools ranging from data integrity checks to crash cause investigation to performance profiling each in just a few hundreds of lines of code IBIS is a system that collects metadata about what happened during data processing for post hoc analysis The metadata is collected from multiple sub systems e g Nova Pig Hadoop that deal with data and processing elements at different granularities e g tables vs records relational operators vs reduce task attempts and offer disparate ways of querying it IBIS integrates this metadata and presents a uniform and powerful query interface to users Speaker BioChristopher Olston is a principal research

For such large\n                  data analysis, programmers have flocked to the\n                  Map-Reduce programming model that is simple,\n                  scalable, and at the same time, extremely\n                  versatile. The explicit dataflow programming\n                  style of Map-Reduce is preferred by many over the\n                  high-level declarative style of SQL. However, the\n                  map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid,\n                  leaving the users to write a lot of custom code\n                  for common operations such as filter, join etc,\n                  and for dealing with multi-step and branching\n                  dataflows. Such custom code is hard to reuse and\n                  maintain, and also impedes optimizations. I will\n                  talk about the design and implementation of Pig:\n                  a high-level dataflow system that aims at a\n                  sweet-spot between the declarative style of SQL\n                  and the procedural style of Map-Reduce. Pig\n                  offers SQL-style high-level data\n                  manipulation constructs, which can be assembled\n                  in an explicit dataflow and interleaved with\n                  custom Map- and Reduce-style functions or\n                  executables. Pig programs are compiled into\n                  sequences of Map-Reduce jobs, and executed in the\n                  Hadoop Map-Reduce environment. Both Pig and\n                  Hadoop are open-source projects administered by\n                  the Apache Software Foundation.</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table>\n            </div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <div class=\"eventDate\">\n              Oct 23, 2009\n            </div>\n          </td>\n\n          <td>\n            <div class=\"eventInfor\">\n              <b>Database Scalability and Indexes</b><br>\n              Goetz Graefe, HP Fellow, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories\n            </div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n\n          <td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\n          'var x=getElementById(\"e73\");if(x.style.display!=\"none\"){x.style.display=\"none\";}else{x.style.display=\"block\";}return false;'>\n          Details</a> <a href=\"slides/HP.ppt\">Slides</a> <a href=\n          \"videos/HP.mov\">Video</a> (455MB)</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"details\" style=\"display:none;\" id=\"e73\">\n              <table>\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c1\">Date and Time</td>\n\n                  <td>Oct 23, 2009 2pm</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Location</td>\n\n                  <td>DBH 4011</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table><br>\n\n              <table>\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c1\">Speaker</td>\n\n                  <td>Goetz Graefe, HP Fellow, Hewlett-Packard\n                  Laboratories</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Title</td>\n\n                  <td>Database Scalability and Indexes</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Abstract</td>\n\n                  <td>Scalability can be achieved by brute-force\n                  parallelism or by smart data structures and\n                  algorithms.

On the other hand, they\n                  typically are able to trade off consistency to\n                  achieve their goals.

It is\n                  imperative to develop a programming model that\n                  hides the complexity of the underlying system but\n                  provides flexibility by allowing users to extend\n                  functionality to meet a variety of requirements.\n                  In this talk, we present a new declarative and\n                  extensible scripting language, SCOPE (Structured\n                  Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution),\n                  targeted for this type of massive data analysis\n                  at Microsoft. The language is designed for ease\n                  of use with no explicit parallelism, while being\n                  amenable to efficient parallel execution on large\n                  clusters. SCOPE borrows several features from\n                  SQL. Data is modeled as sets of rows composed of\n                  typed columns. The select statement is retained\n                  with inner joins, outer joins, and aggregation\n                  allowed. Users can easily define their own\n                  functions and implement their own versions of\n                  operators: extractors (parsing and constructing\n                  rows from a file), processors (row-wise\n                  processing), reducers (group-wise processing),\n                  and combiners (combining rows from two inputs).\n                  SCOPE supports nesting of expressions but also\n                  allows a computation to be specified as a series\n                  of steps, in a manner often preferred by\n                  programmers. We also describe how scripts are\n                  compiled and optimized into efficient, parallel\n                  execution plans and executed on large\n                  clusters.</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table>\n            </div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <div class=\"eventDate\">\n              Dec 4, 2009\n            </div>\n          </td>\n\n          <td>\n            <div class=\"eventInfor\">\n              <b>What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong: The Lessons\n              I Learned Building a Large-Scale DBMS for\n              XML.</b><br>\n              Mary Holstege, Principal Engineer, Mark Logic\n            </div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n\n          <td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\n          'var x=getElementById(\"e78\");if(x.style.display!=\"none\"){x.style.display=\"none\";}else{x.style.display=\"block\";}return false;'>\n          Details</a> <a href=\"slides/MarkLogic.ppt\">Slides</a>\n          <a href=\"videos/MarkLogic.mov\">Video</a> (289MB)</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"details\" style=\"display:none;\" id=\"e78\">\n              <table>\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c1\">Date and Time</td>\n\n                  <td>Dec 4, 2009 2pm</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Location</td>\n\n                  <td>DBH 4011</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table><br>\n\n              <table>\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c1\">Speaker</td>\n\n                  <td>Mary Holstege, Principal Engineer, Mark Logic</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Title</td>\n\n                  <td>What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong: The\n                  Lessons I Learned Building a Large-Scale DBMS for\n                  XML.</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table>\n            </div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <div class=\"eventDate\">\n              Dec 11, 2009\n            </div>\n          </td>\n\n          <td>\n            <div class=\"eventInfor\">\n              <b>Scalable Data Management with DB2</b><br>\n              Matthias Nicola, DB2 pureXML Architect, IBM\n            </div>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td></td>\n\n          <td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\n          'var x=getElementById(\"e79\");if(x.style.display!=\"none\"){x.style.display=\"none\";}else{x.style.display=\"block\";}return false;'>\n          Details</a> <a href=\"slides/Scalable Data Management with DB2.pdf\">Slides</a> <a href=\n          \"videos/IBM.mov\">Video</a> (394MB)</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"details\" style=\"display:none;\" id=\"e79\">\n              <table>\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c1\">Date and Time</td>\n\n                  <td>Dec 11, 2009 2pm</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Location</td>\n\n                  <td>DBH 4011</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table><br>\n\n              <table>\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c1\">Speaker</td>\n\n                  <td>Matthias Nicola, DB2 pureXML Architect,\n                  IBM</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Title</td>\n\n                  <td>Scalable Data Management with DB2</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Abstract</td>\n\n                  <td>Enterprises around the world are relying on\n                  DB2 for scalable data management such as\n                  transaction processing applications and data\n                  warehousing. This presentation provides an\n                  overview of two scalability concepts that DB2\n                  offers: the DB2 database partitioning feature\n                  (DPF) and DB2 pureScale. DB2's database\n                  partitioning feature provides users with a\n                  parallel database system in a shared-nothing\n                  architecture. More computing nodes can be added\n                  to the DPF system to meet growing demands in\n                  terms of data volume and workload. We will\n                  discuss the data partitioning and placement\n                  options as well as query processing concepts in a\n                  DPF database. We will also examine the setup and\n                  results of a recent scalability benchmark for\n                  complex XML query processing in a DB2 partitioned\n                  database. Contrary to the warehousing focus of\n                  DPF, the DB2 pureScale technology provides a\n                  parallel and scalable solution for online\n                  transaction processing applications. We provide\n                  an overview of the shared-disk architecture and\n                  transaction processing concepts in DB2\n                  pureScale.</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Speaker Bio</td>\n\n                  <td>Matthias Nicola is a senior engineer for DB2\n                  pureXML at IBM's Silicon Valley Lab.

However, over the past few years the\n                  data requirements, in terms of availability and\n                  scalability, from Internet scale enterprises that\n                  provide services and cater to millions of users has\n                  been unprecedented. Current proposed solutions to\n                  scalable data management, driven primarily by\n                  prevalent application requirements, significantly\n                  downplay the data consistency requirements and\n                  instead focus on very high availability and almost\n                  unlimited scalability to support data-rich\n                  applications for millions to tens of millions of\n                  users. In particular, the \"newer\" data management\n                  systems limit consistent access only at the\n                  granularity of single objects, rows, or keys,\n                  thereby significantly trading-off consistency in\n                  order to achieve very high scalability and\n                  availability. But the growing popularity of \"cloud\n                  computing\", the resulting shift of a large number of\n                  Internet applications to the cloud, and the quest\n                  towards providing data management services in the\n                  cloud, has opened up the challenge for designing\n                  data management systems that provide consistency\n                  guarantees at a granularity which goes beyond single\n                  rows and keys. In this talk, we analyze the design\n                  choices that allowed modern scalable data management\n                  systems to achieve orders of magnitude higher levels\n                  of scalability compared to traditional\n                  databases. With this understanding, we highlight\n                  some design principles for data management systems\n                  providing scalable and consistent data management as\n                  a service in the cloud.

The first half describes two data processing systems I helped develop: PIG, a dataflow programming environment and Hadoop-based runtime, and NOVA, a workflow manager for Pig/Hadoop. The second half focuses on debugging, and looks at what can be done before, during and after execution of a data processing operation:\n  * Pig's automatic EXAMPLE DATA GENERATOR is used before running a Pig job to get a feel for what it will do, enabling certain kinds of mistakes to be caught early and cheaply. The algorithm behind the example generator performs a combination of sampling and synthesis to balance several key factors---realism, conciseness and completeness---of the example data it produces.\n  * INSPECTOR GADGET is a framework for creating custom tools that monitor Pig job execution. We have implemented a dozen user-requested tools, ranging from data integrity checks to crash cause investigation to performance profiling, each in just a few hundreds of lines of code.\n  * IBIS is a system that collects metadata about what happened during data processing, for post-hoc analysis. The metadata is collected from multiple sub-systems (e.g. Nova, Pig, Hadoop) that deal with data and processing elements at different granularities (e.g. tables vs. records; relational operators vs. reduce task attempts) and offer disparate ways of querying it. IBIS integrates this metadata and presents a uniform and powerful query interface to users.</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                  <td class=\"c2\">Speaker Bio</td>\n\n                  <td>Christopher Olston is a principal research scientist at Yahoo!
