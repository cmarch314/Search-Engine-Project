On the top menu bar, click the \"Get Software\" menu item. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Click on the Get Software menu item\" src=\"./hw0_files/getting_maya_1.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This link will take you to a registration page. Make sure to fill out the \"School Email\" field with your <code>uci.edu</code> email address or this process will not work. You don't need to fill out the \"Student Group\" and \"Student ID\" fields. Once you have filled out the form, hit \"Submit\"</p>\n<p>Autodesk will register your account and send you an activation email. Registration can take a few minutes, so don't worry if the email doesn't show up instantly. Once you get your email, click on the included activation link. You should see a \"Registration Complete\" message.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Registration Complete\" src=\"hw0_files/getting_maya_register.jpg\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"downloading_maya\">Downloading Maya</h2>\n<p>Once registration is complete, go back to <a href=\"http://students.autodesk.com/\">http://students.autodesk.com/</a>, log in with your newly created account, and again click on the \"Get Software\" menu item. Scroll down the page until you see \"Autodesk Maya\". It is listed under \"Other Products\". Click on the Autodesk Maya button.</p>\n<p>From the drop-down menu, select which version you want to download. If you are on Windows, download either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, depending on your computer's processor. If you are on a Mac, just download the Mac OS X version. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Download Maya dialog\" src=\"./hw0_files/getting_maya_download.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Once you select your version, you will be taken to the download page. The download should start automatically, but if not, there is a link at the bottom of the page that will manually start the download. <strong>Make sure to write down your serial number and product, as you will need them during installation</strong>. Maya is a pretty big piece of software (1.2 GB) so make sure you have enough time to download the entire file. I suggest catching up on some reading while you wait. </p>\n<h2 id=\"installing_maya\">Installing Maya</h2>\n<p>Once your download is complete, simply run the installer and follow the on screen instructions. The installer will ask for the serial number from the previous section. After you enter your serial number and product key, Maya will install. You are now the proud owner of Maya 2012.</p>\n<p>A warning: Maya's activation process can take quite a while. If you\nencounter any errors, simply try again with the same data. It should\neventually work.</p>\n</section>\n\n<h2 id=\"configure_os_x__launch_maya\">Configuring Maya</h2>\n<p>If you are already using a 3-button mouse, please feel free to skip this section. </p>\n<h3 id=\"setup_the_mouse\">Setup the Mouse</h3>\n<p> The Maya interface makes heavy use of three-buttons. If possible,\nwe recommend acquiring one. If you are\nusing a computer without a three-button mouse, you will likely need\nto experiment with settings to emulate this behaviour. For example,\non a Mac, open up System Preferences. Select Mouse and Keyboard. Select Mouse in the top menu. Set the right-click button to Secondary. Also change the middle mouse button from \"Off\" to \"Button 3\". You may need to change this setting twice for it to stick.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Mouse Settings\" src=\"./hw0_files/mouse.jpg\"></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enable_infinite_undo\">Enable Infinite Undo</h2>\n<p>When learning Maya, you're going to make mistakes (no matter how good you are). Pressing <strong>Z</strong> will undo your last move in Maya. By default, Maya only lets you undo a certain number of moves. To enable infinite undo, Select <strong>Windows \u2192 Settings/Preferences \u2192 Preferences</strong>. Select the <strong>Undo</strong> menu from the side bar and change the Queue to Infinite. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Open Maya\" src=\"./hw0_files/undo.jpg\"></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"Introduction to Maya\">Introduction to Maya</h3>\n<p> Complete the 7 general excercises listed <a href = \"../../exercises/exercises.html\">here</a> on the following:<br>\nMaya's User Interface (UI)<br>\nCamera Controls<br>\nBasic Selection<br>\nBasic Manipulation<br> \nHierarchy<br>\nPolygon Selection<br>\nPolygon Editing<br>\nThese exercises will not be graded, but will be very useful for completing the assigned homeworks, specifically HW1.\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\nMuch of this content is based on <a href=\"http://learn.ucbugg.com/\">UCBUGG</a>.\n   </div>\n  \n\n</body></html>\n", "id": 30798.0}
