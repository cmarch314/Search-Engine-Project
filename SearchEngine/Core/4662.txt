Pointers to all the teams websites their customers and their office locations have been added Check out the Teams table And note that a couple of the teams have names and eye candy already October 13 The document that Tamara Wolfe provided regarding the PSYO website project is available in both Word and pdf formats October 7 The slides on project management that I showed today are available The PDF file also has some excellent material on project plans that I didn t talk about today but probably will on Tuesday In any event you should find this material useful as you create your project plans September 24 The class TA has been assigned Jie Ren Contact info below September 22 On the first day of class September 28th you will need to turn in a copy of the initial class survey You can print out the survey from the website fill in the form initial at the bottom and bring it to the class Otherwise you ll have to take time at the end of the class to fill it in then In any event you must turn the survey in on the 28th September 22 The web site now has the first three assignments available the prospectus the requirements and the design The remaining two will be available later

of a complete software system using concepts learned in ICS 52 121 and 141 Special emphasis on the need for and use of teamwork careful planning and other techniques for working with large systems This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creating software systems based on the principles discussed in ICS 121 well understood requirements usability and user interface design architectural design and module specification well planned testing effective oral and written communication of concepts proper programming style group coordination product documentation and software process All students are expected to attend all lecture and discussion sections In general there will not be much lecturing in the class Instead class time will be highly interactive and all students are expected to participate About half of the time will be spent performing reviews of the artifacts developed These reviews will take up all lecture and discussion periods the week following the due date for each deliverable Prerequisites ICS 51 with a grade of C or better ICS 121 and 141 Mathematics 2A B C Is the Discussion Section required Yes The discussion section is essential for two reasons You will need to meet with your teammates REGULARLY The best correlation with failure that I ve seen in this class over the past decade has been teams which were unable or unwilling to establish a regular meeting schedule and to keep to it In other words EVERYONE needs to be in attendance at team meetings The discussion section time period is the guaranteed time period for you team to meet Since this is a large class and since each team will be making at least 4 presentations during the quarter we ll have to use some of the discussion sections for those presentations What will the projects be Candidate projects can come from many places in AY 98 99 some ICS 125 teams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested Other teams worked on projects related to on going research programs in the ICS department Other projects may come from the students Choice of projects is related to many goals One key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size It must be big enough to challenge a team of four students but not so big as to commandeer everyone s life As a result we will spend some time at the beginning of the fall attempting to size various projects These planning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses Another goal is to select a different project for each team Since each team will be making regular project presentations to the rest of the class diversity of projects will enable students to learn from experiences across a range of project topics Still another goal is to work on something fun and interesting I ve had students working on flight simulators generating HTML pages linking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts and building graphical program editors There are many opportunities How will teams be composed Each team will have 4 or 5 people I will attempt to balance a team s aggregate expertise with the project they ve decided to work on I will also attempt to accommodate personal preferences for teammates The course survey form which you will complete the first day of class is a key instrument in assigning the teams What s the Drop Add policy Since ICS 125 has a strong team project orientation it is essential that the drop add process be terminated early Therefore NO drops or adds of ICS 125 will be permitted after the end of the SECOND week of class Lecture Topics ICS 125 is on a tight time schedule thus there is not much time for review You are expected to recall the material covered in ICS 121 and the other prerequisite courses Short supplementary lectures are anticipated on Teamwork and team organizations Project management Project cost and schedule estimation Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping Software architectural choice Configuration management and version control Distributed software engineering Engineering of distributed applications including distributed object technology Specific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects chosen by the teams If several of the projects for example are concerned with Internet applications then lectures on protocols and Web technologies will be included Similarly if most projects will be using some particular kind of infrastructure such as CORBA or ActiveX then there will be lectures on that Textbooks Regardless of the project chosen all students will be required to read The Mythical Man Month Depending on the projects chosen additional readings from various sources may be required REQUIRED Author Fred Brooks Title The Mythical Man Month Anniversary Edition New Price 24 5

project is the focus of this course and will be assessed accordingly It will account for 8 of your grade this is broken down between deliverables a team Web page and presentations The remaining 2 will be divided among individual course logs teamwork individual leadership demonstrated and the final Deliverables The ICS 125 project nominally consists of five major assignments Their relative weighting as a percentage of your final grade of each deliverable is indicated in the table below along with the due date The on line versions of the assignments may still be under construction watch the what s

necessarily on their importance with respect to software development Variations to this may be made to accommodate the particular needs of a given project or a given team Also note that the grade for a deliverable will consist not only of the document specification developed during that phase but also the test plan developed along side it as well as the review conducted in class the following week Deliverable Due Dates Deliverables are due at 12 5 PM on the date indicated in the table above NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects Since you are working in this class as part of team it is the team s responsibility to ensure that assignments are turned in on time Normal excuses for late assignments such as illness do not apply in a team setting unless of course everyone on the team is ill Unless directed otherwise deliverables must be turned in directly to the TA or placed in the TA s mailbox before that time Deliverable Reviews Each deliverable will be reviewed in class Each team will be given 15 2 minutes to present their project You will be given guidance in class on how to conduct these presentations Your customer should be invited to your team s Prospectus and Requirements review as well as your demonstration and possibly even your design and code reviews depending on the nature of your customer The review is your team s chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from all relevant parties your document will be reviewed at this time by course staff and clients as well as the rest of the class This review is a formality however and each team should have presented and negotiated both relevant documents to the customer prior to the review if you haven t it may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time Document Requirements All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral parts of systematic software development Their continued up to date existence is necessary for successful system development Do not delete documents after they have been turned in They must reside permanently on your team s website All deliverable documents must be prepared on line and be available as part of your project home page either as either HTML or pdf files NO MS Word files In general the following should be observed Cover page Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving Project title Development phase and deliverable Date Team name number Team members Phase manager Phase clerical person Files and locations href s Table of Contents Every deliverable shall include a table of contents Specification The system specification requirements design module specs code for each deliverable shall correspond in form and content to the outline provided for that phase Sections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked N A Minutes Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of team meetings held during the associated period of time Performance Appraisals Every deliverable shall be accompanied by performance appraisals Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained as part of the project s web page A form is available at http www ics uci edu taylor ics125 fq99 performance appraisal pdf A ps file is also available Project WebPage The project deliverables except for the performance appraisals shall be maintained in a project homepage Fixed up Deliverables For all deliverables except for the last you will also have the opportunity to fix it based on its evaluation You may hand in an improved version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been graded and receive up to 5 of the points deducted on the initial version The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to use the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a bad design or specification You should keep the same responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new responsibilities for the next phase Course Log During your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time either for you employer or to improve your own productivity Throughout this course you will practice doing this by keeping a course log recording the time you spend on all activities related to this course At the beginning of each week you must email the previous week s log to the TA A sheet showing what should be on the log is available at http www ics uci edu taylor ics125 fq99 logform html Keep a copy of your logs you will need them at the end of the quarter for the final review Each entry records the date and amount of time spent type of entry and text describing the entry An entry is one of three types A description records an activity An explanation says why something happened A prescription is a plan for something to do later Most entries will be of the first type but occasionally you should reflect and think about what is going on The time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records the amount of time spent in hours to the nearest quarter hour You will be marked down only for failing to email logs each week giving too little detail or failing to keep track of time spent You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors you make and the amount of time they consume The purpose of recording these errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the kinds of mistakes you typically make With that understanding you can improve your performance in the future by paying extra attention to those areas in which you ve had problems in the past Team Composition Activities and Peer Apportionment of Credit As discussed in class teams will be assigned on as fair a basis as possible for the project The danger most students perceive in working on projects with other students is in being saddled with what they think is a non producer This is particularly true when you don t get to choose all your teammates the situation here Many factors dictate the use of a multi person project for this course You will not after all be able to choose your workmates in the future Therefore to alleviate your concerns and to grade you appropriately at the end of the term project you will be asked to divide 1 points among the members of your project team corresponding to how you believe they contributed to the project as a whole or on a phase by phase basis if you wish In addition each team member will be appraised for each phase This peer apportionment of credit will be used to help determine appropriate individual grades for the project component Team Organization There are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented Ensure that there is adequate coordination among the team members Know each other s login names for electronic mail Know each other s phone numbers Meet at least twice per week outside of class lecture at the same pre determined time each week so as to avoid confusion The Discussion Section is designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone You are strongly urged to use that time slot Have a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if the responsible manager becomes unavailable You are strongly advised to consult weekly with the instructor TA about your progress problems questions etc Meetings Meetings are an important part of a team project A successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definite purpose and associated agenda these are the responsibility of the phase manager and that all decisions be recorded in minutes the responsibility of the phase clerical person The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made and to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting Each deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutes for the team meetings held during the associated period of time I e keep the agenda and the minutes on line as part of your project web page The minutes should outline agenda for the meeting team members present and reason for any member s absence major design decisions discussed task assignments made future meetings scheduled Cost and Benefits This course will demand a lot but I think that you may well find this to be the most rewarding courses that you will take in your undergraduate career ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was the most important class that they took at UCI The techniques presented in class actually work and will help you in future software development At the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of your project website notebook for each team member Take them with you when you go to a job interview Students from past ICS 125 classes have frequently said that it was their project notebook that clinched a job for them Some interviewers have commented that the quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and the quality of the product exceeds those of the production engineers in their companies Keeping in Touch Check the course syllabus page regularly Announcements concerning assignments will be made there changes to the lecture schedule will be announced there and so on Teams and Meetings As noted earlier teams will use at least the discussion sections for team meetings Team Designator Home page Customer Contact Office Compaq Team Compaq Roger Olds CS Trailer Room 1 Posties 1

Special emphasis on the need for and use of teamwork, careful\nplanning, and other techniques for working with large systems.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creating\nsoftware systems based on the principles discussed in ICS 121: well-understood\nrequirements, usability and user interface design, architectural design\nand module specification, well-planned testing, effective oral and written\ncommunication of concepts, proper programming style, group coordination,\nproduct documentation and software process.\n\n<p>All students are expected to attend all lecture and discussion sections.\nIn general, there will not be much lecturing in the class. Instead, class\ntime will be highly interactive, and all students are expected to participate.\nAbout half of the time will be spent performing reviews of the artifacts\ndeveloped. These reviews will take up all lecture and discussion periods\nthe week following the due date for each deliverable.\n\n<h3>\nPrerequisites:</h3>  ICS 51 with a grade of C or better;  ICS 121 and 141;\nMathematics 2A-B-C.  \n\n<h3>  Is the Discussion Section required? </h3>\n\n<p>\nYes!  The discussion section is essential for two reasons:\n<ol>\n<li>  You will need to meet with your teammates REGULARLY.  The best correlation with failure\nthat I've seen in this class over the past decade has been teams which were unable or unwilling\nto establish a regular meeting schedule and to keep to it.  In other words, EVERYONE needs to be \nin attendance at team meetings.  The discussion section time period is the guaranteed time period\nfor you team to meet.\n</li>\n<li>\nSince this is a large class, and since each team will be making at least 4 presentations during\nthe quarter, we'll have to use some of the discussion sections for those presentations.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>\n\n<p>\nCandidate projects can come from many places:  in AY 98-99 some ICS 125\nteams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested.\nOther teams worked on projects related to on-going research programs in\nthe ICS department.  Other projects may come from the students.\n\n<p>\nChoice of projects is related to many goals.\n\n<p>\nOne key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size.  It must be big\nenough to challenge a team of four students, but not so big as to\ncommandeer everyone's life!  As a result we will spend some time at the\nbeginning of the fall attempting to size various projects.  These\nplanning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses.\n\n<p>\nAnother goal is to select a different project for each team.   Since\neach team will be making regular project presentations to the rest of\nthe class, diversity of projects will enable students to learn from\nexperiences across a range of project topics.\n\n<p>\nStill another goal is to work on something fun and interesting!  I've\nhad students working on flight simulators, generating HTML pages,\nlinking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts, and\nbuilding graphical program editors.  There are many opportunities....\n\n<h3>  How will teams be composed? </h3>\n\nEach team will have 4 or 5 people.  I will attempt to balance a team's\naggregate expertise with the project they've decided to work on.  I\nwill also attempt to accommodate personal preferences for teammates.\nThe course survey form, which you will complete the first day of class, is\na key instrument in assigning the teams.\n\n\n<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>\n\n<p>\nSince ICS 125 has a strong team project orientation, it is essential\nthat the drop/add process be terminated early.  Therefore <em> NO drops\nor adds </em> of ICS 125 will be permitted after the end of the SECOND\nweek of class.\n\n<hr>\n<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>\n\n<p>\nICS 125 is on a tight time schedule, thus there is not much time for review.\nYou are expected to recall the material covered in ICS 121 and the other\nprerequisite courses.\nShort supplementary lectures are anticipated on:\n\t<ul>\n\t<li> Teamwork and team organizations\n\t<li> Project management\n\t<li> Project cost and schedule estimation\n\t<li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping\n\t<li> Software architectural choice\n\t<li> Configuration management and version control\n\t<li> Distributed software engineering\n\t<li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology\n\t</ul>\nSpecific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects\nchosen by the teams.

The\nremaining 20% will be divided among individual course logs, teamwork,\nindividual leadership demonstrated, and the final.\n\n<h2>\nDeliverables</h2>\nThe ICS 125 project nominally consists of five major assignments. Their\nrelative weighting (as a percentage of your final grade) of each deliverable\nis indicated in the table below along with the due date. The on-line versions\nof the assignments may still be under construction (watch the what's new\nsection to see when they are available).\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<center><table BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 >\n<tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=CENTER>\n\n<td VALIGN=CENTER><b>Deliverable</b></td>\n<td><b>Weight&nbsp;</b></td>\n<td><b>Description</b></td>\n<td><b>Due Date</b></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>Individual Web Page</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>04 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Teams Designated</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>05 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Projects Selected/Assigned</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>07 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>Team Web Page</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>11 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Prospectus and Plan&nbsp;</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>10&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//prospectus.html\">Prospectus&nbsp;</a></td>\n<td>15 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Prospectus Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>week 4</td>\n<td>18-22 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Requirements Specification</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>15&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//requirements.html\">Requirements&nbsp;</a></td>\n<td>22 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Requirements Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>week 5</td>\n<td>25-29 October</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Architecture/Module Specifications&nbsp;</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>20&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/design.html\">Architecture/Design&nbsp;</a></td>\n<td>05 November</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Design Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>week 7</td>\n<td>8-12 November</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Implementation&nbsp;</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>20&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/implementation.html\">Implementation</a></td>\n<td>19 November</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Code Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>week 9</td>\n<td>22-24 November</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Testing/Test Documentation</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>15&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/integration-test.html\">Integration/Testing</a></td>\n<td>03 December</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr VALIGN=CENTER>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Demonstrations</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>week 10</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>29 November - 03 December</td>\n</tr>\n</table></center>\n\n<p>\nThe deliverables are weighted according to the relative amount of time\nand effort we expect you will spend on each (and not necessarily on their\nimportance with respect to software development). Variations to this may\nbe made to accommodate the particular needs of a given project or a given\nteam. Also, note that the grade for a deliverable will consist not only\nof the document/specification, developed during that phase but also\nthe test plan developed along side it as well as the review conducted in\nclass the following week.\n\n<h3>\nDeliverable Due Dates</h3>\n<p>\nDeliverables are due at 12:50 PM on the date indicated in the table above.\nNO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\nThis applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.\nSince you are working in this class\nas part of team, it is the team's responsibility to ensure that assignments\nare turned in on time.  Normal excuses for late assignments, such as\nillness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the\nteam is ill  :-)\n\n<p>\nUnless directed otherwise, deliverables must be turned in directly to the\nTA or placed in the TA's mailbox before that time. \n\n<h3>\nDeliverable Reviews</h3>\nEach deliverable will be reviewed in class. Each team will be given 15-20\nminutes to present their project.  You will be given guidance in class on\nhow to conduct these presentations.\n\n<p>\nYour customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements review\nas well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code\nreviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is\nyour team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from\nall relevant parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course\nstaff and clients as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is\na formality, however, and each team should have presented and negotiated\nboth relevant documents to the customer prior to the review (if you haven't,\nit may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time).\n\n<h3> Document Requirements</h3>\n<P>\nAll the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral\nparts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date\nexistence is necessary for successful system development.\n<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.  They must\nreside permanently on your team's website.\n\n<P>\nAll deliverable documents must be prepared on-line and be available as part\nof your project home page either as either HTML or .pdf files.  NO MS Word files.\nIn general, the following should be observed.\n<DL ><DT>Cover \"page\".\n<DD> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving\n<DL ><DT><DD> Project title\n<DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable\n<DT><DD> Date\n<DT><DD> Team name/number\n<DT><DD> Team members\n<DT><DD> Phase manager\n<DT><DD> Phase clerical person\n<DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)\n<P>\n</DL>\n\n<P>\n<DT>Table of Contents.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents\n<DT>Specification.\n<DD> The system specification (requirements, design,\nmodule specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and\ncontent to the outline provided for that phase.\nSections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked\n``N/A''.\n<DT>Minutes.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of\nteam meetings held during the associated period of time.\n\n\n<DT>Performance Appraisals.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied\nby performance appraisals.  Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained\nas part of the project's web page.  A form is available at\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf\"> \nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf\n</a>.  A \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.ps\"> \n.ps file </a> is also available.\n\n<DT>Project WebPage.\n<DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,  shall be maintained\nin a project homepage.  \n</DL>\n\n\n<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>\n<P>\nFor all deliverables, except for the last, you will also have the opportunity\nto ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved\nversion of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been\ngraded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial\nversion.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to\nuse the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a\nbad design or specification.  You should keep the\nsame responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new\nresponsibilities for the next phase.\n\n\n<H3> Course Log</H3>\n<P>\nDuring your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time\neither for you employer or to improve your own productivity.\nThroughout this course, you will practice doing this by keeping a\ncourse log recording the time you spend on all activities related to\nthis course.  At the beginning of each week you must email the previous week's log to the TA.\nA sheet showing what should be on the log is available at: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//logform.html\">\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/logform.html </a>.\n<p>\nKeep a copy of your logs:  you will need them at the end of the quarter for the final\nreview.  \n\n<P>\nEach entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,\nand text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:\n<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;\n<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;\n<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.\n</UL>\n\n<p>\nMost entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should\nreflect and think about what is going on.\nThe time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records the\namount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter hour.\n\n<P>\nYou will be marked down only for failing to email logs each week,\ngiving too little detail, or failing to keep track of time spent.  \n\n<P>\nYou are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors\nyou make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording\nthese errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the\nkinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you\ncan improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention\nto those areas in which you've had problems in the past.\n\n<hr>\n<a name=\"apportionment\">\n<H1> Team Composition, Activities,  and Peer Apportionment of Credit</H1>\n<P>\nAs discussed in class, teams will be assigned on as fair a basis as\npossible for the project.  The danger most students perceive in\nworking on projects with other students is in being saddled with (what\nthey think is) a \"non-producer\".  This is particularly true when\nyou don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Many\nfactors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course.\nYou will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the\nfuture.  Therefore, to alleviate your concerns and to grade you\nappropriately, at the end of the term project you will be asked to\ndivide 100 points among the members of your project team,\ncorresponding to how you believe they contributed to the project as a\nwhole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish).  In addition, each\nteam member will be appraised for each phase.  This ``peer\napportionment of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate\nindividual grades for the project component.\n\n<H3> Team Organization</H3>\n<P>\nThere are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.\nEnsure that there is adequate coordination among the team members.\nKnow each other's login names for electronic mail.\nKnow each other's phone numbers.\nMeet <b>at least twice per week</b> (outside of class lecture)\nat the same, pre-determined time each week (so as to avoid confusion).  The Discussion Section\nis designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone.  You are strongly\nurged to use that time slot.\n\n<p>\nHave a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if\nthe responsible manager becomes unavailable.\n\n<p>\nYou are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA\nabout your progress, problems, questions, etc.\n\n<h3> Meetings</h3>\n<P>\nMeetings are an important part of a team project.\nA successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definite\npurpose and associated agenda (these are the responsibility of the\nphase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes\n(the responsibility of the phase clerical person).\n<P>\nThe purpose of minutes is to record decisions made\nand to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting.\nEach deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutes\nfor the team meetings held during the associated period of time.\nI.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project web page.\nThe minutes should outline\n<OL><LI> agenda for the meeting\n<LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence\n<LI> major design decisions discussed\n<LI> task assignments made\n<LI> future meetings scheduled\n</OL>\n\n\n<HR> \n<a name=\"costs\"></a>\n<H1> Cost and Benefits</H1>\n\n<p>\nThis course will demand a lot, but I think that you may well find this\nto be the most rewarding courses that you will take in your\nundergraduate career.  ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was\n<em> the most important </em> class that they took at UCI.  The\ntechniques presented in class actually work and will help you in future\nsoftware development.    \n\n<p>\nAt the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of your\nproject website/notebook for each team member.  Take them with you when\nyou go to a job interview.  Students from past ICS 125 classes\nhave frequently said that it was their project notebook that \nclinched a job for them.  Some interviewers have commented that \nthe quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and the\nquality of the product exceeds those of the production engineers\nin their companies.  \n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"touch\"></a>\n<H1> Keeping in Touch </H1>\nCheck the course syllabus page regularly <http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/syllabus.html>.  \nAnnouncements concerning assignments will be made there, changes to the lecture schedule will be announced there,\nand so on.\n\n<hr>\n<a name=\"Teams\"></a>\n<h1> Teams and Meetings </h1>\n<p>\nAs noted earlier, teams will use (at least) the discussion sections for team meetings.\n\n<a name=\"teams\"></a>           \n<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>  \n<TR><td><strong>Team Designator<td> <Strong>Home page <td><strong>Customer Contact </STRONG><td><strong> Office </tr>  \n\n<TR><td>Compaq\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~compaq-1/\"> Team Compaq </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.compaq.com\"> Roger Olds </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 1  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>Posties-1\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~posties1/\"> Posties-1 </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jfeise/\"> Joe Feise </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 2  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>Posties-2\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~posties2/\"> DAV Posties </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jfeise/\"> Joe Feise </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 2  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>PSYO-1\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~psyo-1/\"> Wild, Wild Web </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/\"> Dick Taylor </a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.pso.org/\"> Tamara Wolfe </a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.ochsanet.org/\"> Chris Russell </a>\n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 3  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>PSYO-2\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~psyo-2/\"> One In a Million Industries </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/\"> Dick Taylor </a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.pso.org/\"> Tamara Wolfe </a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.ochsanet.org/\"> Chris Russell </a>\n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 3  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>PSYO-3\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~psyo-3/\"> Team Mugen </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/\"> Dick Taylor </a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.pso.org/\"> Tamara Wolfe </a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.ochsanet.org/\"> Chris Russell </a>\n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 5  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>IMPP-1\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~impp-1/\"> The Zot Project </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit/\"> Rohit Khare </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 8  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>IMPP-2\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~impp-2/\"> HKPlayers </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit/\"> Rohit Khare </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 8  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n<TR><td>Workflow-1\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~workflo1/\"> Reservation Pro </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pkammer/\"> Peter Kammer </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 9  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n\n<TR><td>Workflow-2\n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~workflo2/\"> Workflo2 </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pkammer/\"> Peter Kammer </a> \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 9  </a>   \n</tr>   \n\n\n\n</table>   \n\n\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"computing\"></a>\n<H1> Computing </H1>\n\nTo facilitate sharing of files among team members, each team will have\nan account on a Unix (Sun Solaris 2) machine, where the team web site\nand project documents must be maintained.\n\n<p>The primary computing facilities will be the <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\">ICS Labs</a>, which provide Sun\nSolaris and Windows/NT machines.&nbsp; The <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/about/hardware.html\">hardware\nenvironment</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/about/software.html\">software\nenvironment</a> is posted on the lab's web site as well as the <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/hours.html\">lab hours</a> and\navailability for Fall 1999.\n\n<p>The system specification for each deliverable may be done on Suns, Macintoshes,\nPCs, or any other available platform.
