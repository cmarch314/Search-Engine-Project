changed for many months Is this because applications are in catch up mode with the specification or is it silence before the XML storm replacing everything with angle brackets What will the next move be While performance is relatively easy to handle the Achilles heel of HTTP is extensibility Even though HTTP does a lot better compared to other protocols the Web has changed many things including the way we think of protocols and how they are extended Although HTTP 1 1 has a large set of features many more useful extensions have been discussed but not deployed At the same time many features in the base protocol are really extensions that should not have been in the base protocol This talk will be an overview of the current state of HTTP extension initiatives and a perspective of what can be done both to application models and specifications in order to get to the next level of the Web evolution without fragmenting the Web as an information space or letting HTTP get stuck in its current mold Biography Henrik Frystyk Nielsen is a Program Manager at Microsoft Redmond Washington Since the beginning of 1994 Henrik has been working on mechanisms for dealing with distributed evolution and interoperability in the Web He is a co author of the HTTP 1 and HTTP 1 1 specifications as well as the HTTP Extension Framework In 1995 Henrik joined the initial W3C team at MIT where he served as the Activity Lead for HTTP HTTP NG and the Web Characterization effort and as a key developer and maintainer of Libwww Before that he worked on the initial World Wide Web project at CERN where he participated in the early design of HTTP 1 and worked on mechanisms for implementing Internet application protocols as hierarchical state machines He holds a degree as Master of Electrical Engineering in Telecommunications from Aalborg University Denmark WebDAV What s Next Jim Whitehead Information and Computer Science UC Irvine ejw ics uci edu In February 1999 the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol was approved by the IETF and has since been adopted in multiple servers and clients such as Apache and Office 2 providing remote collaborative authoring facilities for the Web Since then work on WebDAV has continued with current efforts focusing on adding searching versioning and configuration management Beginning with a brief overview of WebDAV the talk will mostly focus on what s next It will accomplish this by giving an overview of the DAV Searching and Locating DASL searching protocol and the Delta V versioning and configuration management protocol both current efforts within the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Each effort will be discussed with scenarios of use goals and highlights of the protocol s design Biography Jim Whitehead is the Chair of the WebDAV Working Group
