The event highlighted a range of student innovations, from mobile apps, to search engines, interactive games and more.</p>\n<p>\"Students work on real-world projects addressing real needs of real users,\" says Informatics Lecturer Hadar Ziv. \"The projects require hands-on application of all the skills and&#160;tools the students acquired and\nis the ultimate culmination of their four-year curriculum. Students also&#160;learn and apply a host of non-technical skills\nthat will serve their entire professional careers &#8212; from project,\ntime and team management to communication, collaboration, negotiation and\nconflict-resolution skills.\"</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s showcase participants are listed below. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brenschool/sets/72157626430267243/\">Click here</a>&#160;to view photos of the event.

People spend hours playing games that plant fake\ntrees &#8212; why not let them plant real trees? Burble allows users to plant real\ntrees in various parts of the world. The tree planting is made possible through\nnonprofit organizations affiliated with the game. By caring for your personal\npet, Burble will help plants grow and plant them in gardens that reflect those\nin the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Team: Creampuff</p>\n<p>Members: Sabel Braganza, Mark Capil, Jonathan Fuentes, Kyle\nMusler, Kyle Lutze</p>\n<p>Project: Chowdr is a dual-sided mobile application. It\nserves as a marketing platform for food truck chefs and owners, as well as a\nmobile and web application for customers to find these food trucks. By tying\nthe two sides together, Chowdr builds a solid relationship between a food truck\nand its fans.<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Team: ExpediANT</p>\n<p>Members: Gilberto Bardales, Norik Davtian, Georgio Moussan,\nDonald Stern</p>\n<p>Project: ExpediANT is a limousine management system that\nfocuses on routing and scheduling for vehicle rental companies. It is a free,\nweb-based solution built with extendibility in mind.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Team: Prograam K</p>\n<p>Members: Aaron Donk, Anthony Liu, Grace Uchida, Karen Quan,\nMelanie Cheung, Ryan Nissenbaum</p>\n<p>Sponsor: Elif Hanna, Greenwithus.com</p>\n<p>Project: An e-commerce website that allows users to not only\nbrowse through (and send) a selection of pre-made cards, but also upload their\nown picture and customize it to their liking. Designers can upload their own\ndesign and enter it in a weekly contest where users can vote on their favorite.\nThe winner of the weekly contest will have his/her design available for the\npublic to purchase on the website.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Team: Inyofam</p>\n<p>Members: Chris Lee, Frank Morales, JD Wolk, Masis Nguyen,\nRam Murthy, Zack Pelz</p>\n<p>Sponsors: UC Irvine Medical Center, Bren:ICS</p>\n<p>Project: I2b2 is a web tool funded by the NIH that accesses\nmedical and clinical repositories by academic research centers and\nuniversities. I2b2 is a discovery tool used by clinical researchers to identify\ncohort patients for research participation. Our sponsor, the UCI Medical\nCenter, needed a dictionary tool that integrated into the interface. I3PO\naltered and enhanced i2b2 based on user testing and feedback. The user\ninterface was cleaned up to improve the workflow. The dictionaries map medical\ncodes to healthcare terminology. Fuzzy logic provides meaningful definitions to\ncodes and partial clinical diagnoses.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Team: Team 411</p>\n<p>Members: Ryan Hsu, Ellen Eramya, Alex Bretana, Danny Kim,\nJosh Papa</p>\n<p>Sponsors: Daniel Brienen, Ryan K. Olsen, UCI Medical Center</p>\n<p>Project: The UCI Medical Center Department of Radiology medical\nrecords contain two different sets of codes: diagnostic and treatment. These\nare input by different people throughout the patient&#8217;s visits in the hospital.\nCodes are supposed to match up perfectly, but they don&#8217;t always &#8212; and insurance\ncompanies won&#8217;t reimburse the hospital unless they do. We&#8217;ve built a medical\ncode verification application that checks for mismatched codes and helps\ncorrect them, potentially saving the UCI Medical Center $400,000 a year.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Team: Bionic Centaurs</p>\n<p>Members: Marianne Conner, Edward Gim, Roger Le, Danielle\nSong, Duncan Tsai</p>\n<p>Sponsors: Jon Teichrow, Gary Teichrow, Will Hartung, Mirth\nCorporation</p>\n<p>Project: Mirth Archive is a medical record search engine.
