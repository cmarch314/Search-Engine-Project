Institute Hello everyone A short time ago I posted 3 Simple Quartics to sci math seeking some nice Solutions to a triple of fourth degree Polynomials I have received a few responses stating interest in the problem and one good reference but alas no Solution In this post I intend to explain in some detail the Theory behind these Equations in the hopes that a complete understanding of the Problem will generate a good approach to the Solution I welcome any and all comments or suggestions concerning this topic please respond by e mail I realize that this article may be excessively long for a post but I have found myself unable to produce an abstract that adequately expresses the intriguing qualities of the subject matter It is my hope that the content of this article will justify its use of bandwidth Thanks in advance for your time Don Mc Connell bdsm fermat wpi edu HEDRONOMETRY The Search for Solutions to the Perfect Tetrahedron Equation SUMMARY Hedronometry is an extension of Trigonometry to 3 Dimensions focussing on the relationships between the Angles and the Faces of a Tetrahedron Tetrahedra have more degrees of freedom than Triangles and consequently are not uniquely determined by say the Areas of their Faces in the way that Triangles are uniquely determined by the Lengths of their Edges Yet there do exist a number of Hedronometric analogues to Trigonometric formulae the Neo Pythagorean Theorem and two Laws of Cosines to name a few that provide vaguely familiar relationships between the Faces and Angles These formulae are discussed first Restricting our focus to Perfect Tetrahedra Tetrahedra for opposite Edges are Orthogonal as Vectors we find ourselves with a class of figures that are uniquely determined by their Face Areas up to permutation of the Faces of course The Perfect Tetrahedon Equation P T E of which the 3 Simple Quartics were versions describes the closer ties between Face Areas and Dihedral Angles in Perfect Tetrahedra providing the key to determining the overall shape of a Tetra hedron whose Face Areas are given However even though the P T E represents a nice relationship its Solutions appear to be anything BUT nice I am convinced nevertheless that a inspired simplification can be performed on the results I have been able to obtain yielding forms of the Solutions that reflect the beauty of the Problem The challenge I set forth then is to find that simplification FIND THE NICE FORMS OF SOLUTIONS TO THE PERFECT TETRAHEDRON EQUATION Note Hedronometry is by no means a new subject I understand that some of the ideas presented here were developed over a century ago as aspect of Tetrahedrometry I forget the name of the Mathematician who published two volumes on the subject The 2 results I mentioned Pyth Thm Law of Cosines can be found in fairly recent Journal publications e mail for references But I have no idea if the problem I pose or the answers I seek already exist in the literature Alright now to begin NOTATION Let the Vertices of a Tetrahedron be labelled Q A B and C The Faces and their Areas opposite these Vertices we denote R X Y and Z respectively An Edge thought of as a Vector through points U and V we denote UV thus the Edges are QA QB QC AB BC and CA We use for the Length of an Edge Dihedral Angles we denote like the Edges hopefully without confusion Now although the Face Areas X Y Z and R do not define a Tetrahedron we do have the following THE NEO PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM If Tetrahedron QABC has a Right Corner at Q that is if Edges QA QB and QC are mutually perpendicular then 2 2 2 2 X Y Z R the Sum of the Squares of the Areas of the Leg Faces is equal to the Square of the Area of the Hypotenuse Face PROOF Exercise It s pretty easy requiring nothing more sophisticated than Heron s Formula for Triangle Area COMMENT 1 Sadly the Converse of this Theorem is not true Having the Sum of Squares relation does not guarantee the existence of a Right Corner Thus there are Pythagorean Tetrahedra that are not Right Corner Tetrahedra COMMENT 2 Happily this idea extends to n Dimensions as a Theorem for an n dimensional Right Simplex where n mutually perpendicular Edges meet at a Vertex But this is a story for another day Just as the ordinary Pythagorean Theorem can be viewed as a special case of the Law of Cosines so the Neo Pythagorean Theorem is a special case of THE FIRST LAW OF COSINES LOC 1 2 2 2 2 R X Y Z 2 Y Z cos QA 2 Z X cos QB 2 X Y cos QC PROOF Exercise This too is easy though it involves a great deal of symbol manipulation and a working knowledge of the formulae from Spherical Trigonometry in particular a Law of Cosines in order to relate Dihedral Angles to Face Angles like AQB COMMENT When Q is a Right Corner QA QB and QC are all Right Angles so that LOC 1 reduces to the Neo Pythagorean Theorem By Symmetry we can find similar expressions for X 2 Y 2 and Z 2 in terms of other Faces and opposite Dihedral Angles The four expressions combine to give THE SECOND LAW OF COSINES LOC 2 2 2 2 2 2 R X 2 X R cos BC H Y Z 2 Y Z cos QA 2 2 2 2 2 R Y 2 Y R cos AC J Z X 2 Z X cos QB 2 2 2 2 2 R Z 2 Z R cos AB K X Y 2 X Y cos OC COMMENT 1 Notice that Faces R X bound Angle BC and Faces Y Z bound Angle QA moreover BC and QA are opposite one another in the Tetrahedron Similar observations hold for the other Equations COMMENT 2 There is a geometric interpretation of the numbers H J and K They are the Areas of Pseudo Faces and can be calculated by QA x BC QB x CA QC x AB H J K 2 2 2 Where x is the Cross Product This fact isn t very important now but it will aid discussion later Also using H 2 J 2 and K 2 as they are used in LOC 2 will help with simplification COROLLARY to LOC 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 X Y Z R H J K PROOF Simply set the sum of the second column from the statment of LOC 2 equal to the sum of the third column then simplify using the statement of LOC 1 Okay so now we know that all information about a Tetrahedron can be gleaned from six Numbers X Y Z R H J and K with the Corollary making one of these Numbers you choose unnecessary These Areas and Pseudo Areas give us Dihedral Angles by LOC 2 the Dihedral Angles give us Face Angles by Spherical Trigonometry and Face Angles together with Face Areas give us lengths of Edges Unfortunately all 6 of these Area Numbers are virtually independent of one another but subject to a Triangle Inequality of sorts However with Perfect Tetrahedra defined below we get a situation in which X Y Z and R suffice to determine all information about the Tetra hedron DEFINITION A Perfect Tetrahedron QABC is a Tetrahedron whose opposing Edges are orthogonal when thought of as Vectors That is if UV represents the Vector going through Points U and V and represents the Euclidean Dot Product then QA BC QB CA QC AB NOTE In a Perfect Tetrahedron the Pseudo Faces can be computed as QA BC QB CA QC AB H J K 2 2 2 The following Lemma and its Corollary will be useful LEMMA Let UQV be the Angle between Edges Vectors QU and QV In a Perfect Tetrahedron QABC cos BQC cos CQA cos AQB QA QB QC PROOF Vector methods handle this nicely although High School Trig can do the job as well COROLLARY to LEMMA The Face Angles at a Corner of a Perfect Tetrahedron are either all Acute all Right or all Obtuse further a Perfect Tetra hedron can have at most one Right Corner or Obtuse Corner By this Corollary we may assume that Q is not a Right Corner Therefore we may use the Lemma to write QA k cos BQC QB k cos CQA QC k cos AQB for some k Using these facts and the formulae for the Areas of X Y and Z QB QC sin BQC QC QA sin CQA QA QB sin AQB X Y Z 2 2 2 we can get X cos CQA sin BQC cos QB cos QC cos QA by Spherical Trig Y cos BQC sin CQA cos QA cos QB cos QC Y cos QC cos QA cos QB Z cos QA cos QB cos QC and Z cos QB cos QC cos QA X cos QC cos QA cos QB Now using the formulae for X Y and Y Z as well as the Formula in LOC 1 we can solve for cos QA cos QB and cos QC in terms of X Y Z and R Thus the Face Areas completely determine the Tetrahedron So the only thing to do is solve this system of Equations THIS IS WHERE THE 3 SIMPLE QUARTICS COME IN NOTATION Let A cos QA B cos QB and C cos QC Then the System we are trying to solve looks like this X B C A Y C A B Z A B C Y A B C Z B C A X C A B 2 2 2 2 R X Y Z 2 X Y C 2 Z X B 2 Y Z C Maple V Release 2 assimilates the basic idea here quite rapidly giving the following Solutions though in a slightly different form 2 2 2 2 Y X C X Y Z R 2 X Y C A 2 2 2 Z X Y 2 X Y C 2 2 2 2 X Y C X Y Z R 2 X Y C B 2 2 2 Z X Y 2 X Y C 3 3 4 2 2 3 2 2

the hard part and here our investigations come to a screeching halt The Quartic Polynomial of which C is a Root is a form of the Perfect Tetrahedron Equation Fortunately the P T E is only Quartic so that it is solvable by Radicals Un fortunately the Solutions look absolutely hideous even when small values are substituted in for X Y Z and R In an attempt to simplify the Solutions one might try to simplify the Equation One obtains a slightly less complicated version of the P T E by subsituting 2 2 2 X Y K C from the Definition of K in LOC 2 to get 2 X Y 8 6 2 2 2 2 3 K 4 K X Y Z R 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 K X Y Z R 2 X R Y Z 2 Y R Z X 2 2 2 2 2 2 Z R X Y Observe that this is a Quartic in K 2 and it has no linear term is this good This is essentially one of the 3 Simple Quartics from my previous post although in that post I had replaced X 2 with X Y 2 with Y and I also made some other variable assignments in an attempt to simplify things By cycling Variables K J H K Z Y X Z R R we can transform the K 2 Quartic to a J 2 Quartic and the H 2 Quartic completing the list of 3 Simple Quartics I mention these other two Quartics because while the Solutions to any one of them look hopelessly complex we can observe that since the Solutions must satisfy the simple relation shown in the LOC 2 Corollary there must be some method in the madness To plead this case a little more convincingly let me remind the Reader that any Quartic Equation 4 3 2 a q b q c q d q e has Roots of the form b q STUFF 4a Consequently the Solutions to the three P T E s have the form 2 2 2 2 2 X Y Z R H STUFF 1 3 2 2 2 2 2 X Y Z R J STUFF 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 X Y Z R K STUFF 3 3 This gives that 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 H J K X Y Z R STUFF 1 STUFF 2 STUFF 3 In accordance with the Corollary to LOC 2 we can conclude that STUFF 1 STUFF 2 STUFF 3 Now the STUFF s are pretty complicated expressions involving complex numbers and nested Radicals But as complicated as these thing are they MUST cancel each other out in the end and this is encouraging Somehow some way these STUFF s can be artfully manipulated into expressions that obviously cancel I have searched for over 5 years for this method of artful manipulation but to no avail Maple hasn t been much help in the general case I have waited for over an hour at a sitting for Maple to churn out even the ugly Solutions to the P T E but the task seems to require a great deal more time than I can spend waiting Let s take a specific example to show the extent of the problem for even simple numerical values Assign X 1 Y 2 Z 5 R 9 COMMENT The values are chosen to avoid some special circumstances and in the hopes that they as prime powers might be recognizable inside a complicated expression These give the following P T E system 8 6 4 3 H 444 H 16353 H 28224 8 6 4 3 J 444 J 15345 J 34151 4 8 6 4 3 K 444 K 5265 K 28224 Maple solves these Equations readily In evaluated form we get 2 8 H 86 3 112783 212 96132 1 i 2 8 J 22 8279673 124927722 1 i 2 6 K 2 616 75639 21 32782 1 1 i Of course there are really four choices for H 2 four for J 2 and four for K 2 since these quantities are Roots of a Quartic However one can easily pick out a particular set H 2 J 2 K 2 that satisfies the Corollary to LOC 2 in fact the twelve total Solutions can be partitioned into four such sets In complicated mess form brace yourselves 3 4 1 2 2 3 1 3 1 2

be simplified a little bit although Maple doesn t seem to realize this fact more importantly observe that the STUFF s are the fractions following the 37 s in each line and these STUFF s have to cancel but getting them into obvious cancelling form requires some bit of insight that I just haven t acquired In this numerical case we can perhaps see better that the problem becomes one of denesting the nested Radicals Denesting is a method of algebraic manipulation with its core in the theory of Field Extensions As an example can be denested to 5 2 6 2 3 Susan Landau in Simplification of Nested Radicals SIAM J Comput 21 Feb 1992 85 11 explains Denesting and provides an algorithm for denesting arbitrarily deep Radical Expressions I freely admit that I do not fully comprehend the steps involved but I have only begun to look into this avenue of investigation I am not sure if the algorithm will readily transfer to the general X Y Z R case since the steps require knowledge of Irreducible Polynomials and such things which I should think would be extremely difficult to determine when dealing with variables instead of numbers At this point I d be happy to see the denested forms of the three Expressions above examination of these might provide some valuable insight to the general case fostering a good guess or two that could save a lot of time Having mentioned time I find that perhaps I should not waste much more of the Reader s I ll close up this post with a listing of some Special Case Solutions to the P T E s Perhaps someone can discern the Grand Pattern from these scattered examples The Solutions for H 2 J 2 and K 2 are ordered such that repective Solutions for these three quantities satisfy the Corollary to LOC 2 Some of the Roots are extraneous see discussion below and represent Roots that are too complicated to write out CASE ROOTS OF P T E s 2 2 EQUI HEDRAL 2 2 2 4 X 4 X X Y Z R H J K 3 3 2 2 2 2 TRISO HEDRAL 2 2 2 3 X R 3 X R X Y Z R H J K 3

X Y Z 2 2 2 J X Z 2 2 2 K X Y FLAT 2 2 R X Y Z H Y Z 2 2 J X Z 2 2 K X Y NOTE I should mention something about extraneous Roots In the Root List for each of H 2 J 2 and K 2 in the cases above the last three Roots can be considered extraneous Let me explain Notice that if H then by the formula given for calculating H from the Cross Product either QA or BC so either Y Z or X R Similarly if J then either X Z or Y R and if K then either X Y or Z R Now the Triso hedral Equi hedral case the Roots for the triple H J K imply that X Y Z R But in this case the formula in the first entries of the Root List give us the answer Thus there is no need for the entries Moreover the second entry is unnecessary since it simply copies the first In the Doubly Biso hedral case H 2 can equal X R 2 only if we have X Y Z R which means that H s value can be computed from its first Root formula and so can the corresponding values of J and K similarly for when J 2 X R 2 So the last two entries in these Root Lists are extraneous Moreover one can show that X 2 R 2 2sqrt X 4 X 2 R 2 R 2 is non positive and reaches zero only when X 2 R 2 but if these are identical then the second Root formulae for H 2 and J 2 yield so that we get X Y Z R and find that again the first Root formulae suffice In the Pythagorean case one can use arguments about Edges to show that the Tetrahedron must be a Right Corner Tetrahedron that is the Neo Pythagorean is an if and only if Proposition in the realm of Perfect Tetrahedra Another nice thing about Perfect Tetrahedra Thus A B C and the first Roots give the Solutions so we don t even need the s One can show that in the Flat Case the Tetrahedron is in fact flat all Faces lie in the same Plane and the Vertex Q lies at the Ortho centre of Face R Here H must be Y Z J must be X Z and K must be X Y by Edge arguments The Solutions in this case are extraneous as well Is it true in general that 3 of the Solutions for each of H 2 J 2 and K 2 are extraneous I don t know Numerical experimentation has always lead to twelve values all together which could be grouped into H J K triplets satisfying LOC 2 Some of the numbers have been negative or even complex which does make them extraneous as Area Values In the numerical example above it may be that the Imaginary components are supposed to be zero My GUESS is that there is only one valid triplet except in special cases where we have repeated Roots and that 3 4 s of each P T E contains useless information but I don t know for sure yet if that is the case Well anyway that s about all I care to inflict upon you for now Anyone interested in other aspects of Hedronometry such as its analogue in Hyperbolic Space among other things should feel free to inquire I have a little notebook full of bits and pieces but nothing especially deep Let me close now by saying that although it is trivial Mathematics Hedronometry has been a pet project of mine since my High School Days I ve been struggling with various forms of the P T E off and on for nearly 1 years and I d very much like to get its Solution pinned down So I appreciate all the help I can get in this matter Any questions comments suggestions

an expression for the dihedral angles He has also restricted to the case where every pair of opposite edges is perpendicular and wants the dihedral angles in terms of the four areas The

principle it follows that R cRX X cRY Y cRZ Z X cRX R cXY Y cXZ Z Y cYX X cRY R cYZ Z Z cZX X cZY Y cRZ R Now multiply each equation by the left hand side and subtract the last three equations from

QC PROOF Exercise This too is easy though it involves a great The area vector of a plane region on the boundary of a solid in 3 space has magnitude the area of the region and direction the outwards normal The area vectors of the faces of a solid in 3 space add up to zero so the sum of the area vectors of two of the faces has the same length of the sum of the area vectors of the other two and the sum of the area vectors of three of the faces has the same length as the area vector of the other The second and first law of cosines follow The argument applies to polyhedra with any number of faces and in any dimension and in particular as Billy Don McConnell points out to simplices in n space I suppose this result is to be found in Grassmann s Ausdehnunglehre though I ve never looked The statement that the area vectors add up to zero can be thought of as a limiting case of the statement that the integral of the normal vector of a smooth closed surface with respect to surface area is zero which can be deduced from Stokes s theorem You can get the polyhedral case directly from a suitably formulated version of Stokes s theorem Essentially it means that if fluid is flowing at a velocity constant in space and time as much fluid flows out of the tetrahedron or other solid as flows into it The vector area of the pseudoface tells you how much fluid crosses a surface which spans the skew quadrilateral which divides the tetrahedron into two triangles if the fluid is flowing with unit speed and the best direction is chosen for its velocity vector I hope Billy Don McConnell will

apparently never made it into the FAQ for this newsgroup THE VOLUME OF SIMPLICES Simplices plural of simplex are convex bodies which generalize the notions of triangles and tetrahedra to n dimensional euclidean space E n A k dimensional simplex has k 1 affinely independent vertices k 1 k 2 edges k 1 k k 1 3 two dimensional faces and so forth up to k 1 k 1 dimensional faces Just as triangles can exist in E 3 k simplices can exist in E n for any n k Any convex polytope the generalization of polygons and polyhedra to E n can be partitioned into simplices just as any convex polygon can be partitioned into triangles so in principle if you can compute the volume of arbitrary simplices you can compute the volume of any convex polytope There are several pretty and easily implemented formulae which give the volume of a k dimensional simplex sitting in euclidean n space S in terms of different kinds of given information such as the coordinates of the vertices or the lengths of the edges These formulae can be used by anyone who knows how to compute a determinant although software such as Mathematica will probably be needed to evaluate really large determinants I will write Vol k for k dimensional volume really k dimensional Lebesgue measure for those who know what this means thus Vol 1 means length Vol 2 means area and so forth Unless stated otherwise S will denote a k

a bit paranoid about address harvesters Incidentally I promised references to anyone who e mailed me about the topic in the years since the post I ve lost track of those references Sorry Second I essentially solved the Perfect Tetrahedron Equations PTEs recently At least I solved something equivalent to the problem posed by them I found a Heron like formula that gives the volume of a perfect tetrahedron in terms of the areas of its faces A perfect tetrahedron is one whose pairs of opposite edges determine pairs of orthogonal vectors With face areas and volume known various substitutions into other formulae can yield things like dihedral and face angles and areas of pseudo faces the primary target of the previously posted PTEs thus all aspects of a Perfect Tetrahedron are derivable from the areas of its faces My solution isn t explicit but is encoded in a single quartic instead of the four I d given before the one quartic is far more complicated to express than the other four but I haven t done a great deal of analysis to see what I can fix up Here tis Let X Y Z and R be the areas of faces of a perfect tetrahedron and let W 81 volume 4 Then W is the root of the following

McConnell wrote I found a Heron like formula that gives the volume of a perfect tetrahedron in terms of the areas of its faces A perfect tetrahedron is one whose pairs of opposite edges determine pairs of orthogonal vectors My solution isn t explicit but is encoded in a single quartic instead of the four I d given before the one quartic is far more complicated to express than the other four but I haven t done a great deal of analysis to see what I can fix up At any rate I d welcome any insights about how to simplify the Heron Quartic Pointers to discussions about expressions I ve denoted with a b c d notation would be helpful This may not be of any use to you but here s an old post on this subject It s interesting that this approach seems to invariably lead to a quartic equation although yours is the first I ve seen where the quartic is in terms of the volume itself rather than one of the edge lengths In general there is no complete generalization of Heron s formula giving the volume of a general tetrahedron in terms of the areas of its faces because the face areas don t uniquely determine the volume in contrast to the case of triangles where the three edge lengths determine the area However it IS possible to derive a Heron s formula for tetrahedrons if we restrict ourselves to just those that would fit as the hypotenuse face of a right 4D solid Notice that EVERY triangle is the face of a right tetrahedron which explains why Heron s formula is complete for triangles To review remember that Heron s formula for triangles is essentially equivalent to Pythagoras Theorem for right tetrahedrons If A xyo A xoz and A oyz denote the areas of the three orthogonal faces of a right tetrahedron and A xyz denotes the area of the hypotenuse face then it s easy to show that A xyz 2 A xyo 2 A xoz 2 A oyz 2 1 This is not only a generalization of Pythagoras s Theorem it s also essentially Heron s formula for triangles Note that if a b c denote the three orthogonal edge lengths of the tetrahedron then the areas A xyo A xoz and A oyz are simply ab 2 ac 2 and bc 2 Furthermore the edges of the hypotenuse face d e f are directly related to a b c according to the 2D Pythagorean theorem a 2 b 2 d 2 a 2 c 2 e 2 2 b 2 c 2 f 2 so we can express the squares of the areas A xyo A xoz A oyz in equation 1 in terms of d 2 e 2 and f 2 to give the ordinary Heron s formula explicitly Incidentally it might be and has been argued that this derivation does not apply to obtuse triangles because the hypotenuse face of a right tetrahedron is necessarily acute i e each of its angles must be less than 9 degrees However ANY triangle can be the hypotenuse face of a right tetrahedron provided the orthogonal edge lengths and areas are allowed to be imaginary It s interesting to speculate on whether the ancient Greeks might have been aware of this aspect of the problem Anyway we can do the same thing for tetrahedrons based on the generalized Pythagorean theorem for volumes of right 4D solids V wxyz 2 V wxyo 2 V wxoz 2 V woyz 2 V oxyz 2 3 If we let a b c d denote the orthogonal edge lengths of the 4D solid then the volumes of the four orthogonal faces are simply abc 6 abd 6 acd 6 and bcd 6 so equation 3 can be rewritten as V wxyz 2 abc 6 2 abd 6 2 acd 6 2 bcd 6 2 3 Also the areas of the four faces of our hyoptenuse solid can be expressed in terms of a b c d by means of the 3D Pythagorean theorem ab 2 ac 2 bc 2 4 A 1 2 ab 2 ad 2 bd 2 4 A 2 2 4 ac 2 ad 2 cd 2 4 A 3 2 bc 2 bd 2 cd 2 4 A 4 2 Thus given the four face areas A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 we have four equations in the four unknowns a b c d so we can solve for these values and then compute the area using 3 This is the point at which people usually turn away from this approach for two reasons 1 everything we re doing is restricted to the special tetrahedrons that can serve as the hypotenuse of a right 4D simplex so we re certainly not going to end up with a general formula applicable to every tetrahedron and such formulas are already available anyway via the usual determinants and 2 it turns out to be somewhat messy to solve the set of equations 4 Pressing on anyway we can reduce 4 to a single quartic in the square of any of the four variables a b c or d Arbitrarily selecting c and letting A B C D denote 4 times the squares of the face areas i e the right hand sides of equations 4 we can express the quartic in x c 2 with coefficients that are functions of B and the elementary symmetric functions of A C D s1 A C D s2 AC AD CD s3 ACD In these terms the quartic for x c 2 is 12B x 4 3s1 2 12s2 14Bs1 B 2 x 3 2B s1 2 6s2 B 2 s1 s1 3 4s1s2 36s3 x 2 2B s1s2 6s3 B 2 s2 4s2 2 s1 2 s2 12s1s3 x s3 s1 B 2 Of course the analagous quartics can be given for a 2 b 2 and d 2 but once we have any one of them we can more easily compute the others For example given c we can compute b from the relation c 2 A c 2 D b c c 2 C and the values of a and d follow easily allowing us to compute the volume using equation 3 It would be nice if we could express the volume as an explicit function of the face areas but I don t know if such a formula exists MathPages http www seanet com ksbrown I

I have received \na few responses stating interest in the problem  (and one good reference), \nbut alas no Solution.\n\nIn this post I intend to explain, in some detail, the Theory behind these\nEquations, in the hopes that a complete understanding of the Problem will \ngenerate a good approach to the Solution.

It is my hope that the content  \nof this article will justify its use of bandwidth.\n\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nDon Mc Connell\n<A HREF=\"mailto:bdsm@fermat.wpi.edu\">bdsm@fermat.wpi.edu</A>\n\n                               HEDRONOMETRY: \n\n         The Search for Solutions to the Perfect Tetrahedron Equation\n\nSUMMARY. \"Hedronometry\" is an extension of Trigonometry to 3-Dimensions,\n         focussing on the relationships between the Angles and the Faces \n         of a Tetrahedron.  Tetrahedra have more degrees of freedom than \n         Triangles, and consequently are not uniquely determined by, say,\n         the Areas of their Faces in the way that Triangles are uniquely\n         determined by the Lengths of their Edges.  Yet there do exist a \n         number of Hedronometric analogues to Trigonometric formulae  -- \n         the \"Neo-Pythagorean Theorem\" and two \"Laws of Cosines\" to name\n         a few -- that provide vaguely familiar relationships between the\n         Faces and Angles.  These formulae are discussed first.\n            \n         Restricting our focus to \"Perfect Tetrahedra\" -- Tetrahedra for\n         opposite Edges are Orthogonal (as Vectors) -- we find ourselves\n         with a class of figures that _are_ uniquely determined by their \n         Face-Areas (up to permutation of the Faces, of course).  \n\n         The \"Perfect Tetrahedon Equation\" -- \"P.T.E.\" -- (of which the \n         \"3 'Simple' Quartics\" were versions) describes the closer ties \n         between Face-Areas and Dihedral Angles in Perfect Tetrahedra, \n         providing the key to determining the overall shape of a Tetra-\n         hedron whose Face-Areas are given.  However, even though the\n         P.T.E. represents a _nice_ relationship, its Solutions appear\n         to be anything BUT nice. I am convinced, nevertheless, that a\n         inspired simplification can be performed on the results I have\n         been able to obtain, yielding forms of the Solutions that reflect\n         the beauty of the Problem.  \n\n         The challenge I set forth, then, is to find that simplification:  \n\n    FIND THE \"NICE\" FORMS OF SOLUTIONS TO THE PERFECT TETRAHEDRON EQUATION.\n\n   Note.  \"Hedronometry\" is by no means a new subject. I understand that\n          some of the ideas presented here were developed over a century \n          ago, as aspect of \"Tetrahedrometry\". (I forget the name of the \n          Mathematician who published two volumes on the subject). The 2\n          results I mentioned (Pyth. Thm. &amp; Law of Cosines) can be found\n          in fairly recent Journal publications (e-mail for references).\n\t  But I have no idea if the problem I pose or the answers I seek\n          already exist in the literature.\n\nAlright, now to begin.\n\nNOTATION: Let the Vertices of a Tetrahedron be labelled  Q, A, B, and C.\n\t  The Faces (and their Areas) opposite these Vertices we denote \n          R, X, Y, and Z, respectively. An Edge (thought of as a Vector) \n          through points U and V we denote UV; thus the Edges are QA, QB, \n          QC, AB, BC, and CA.  We use \"| |\" for the Length of an Edge.\n          Dihedral Angles we denote like the Edges, hopefully without\n          confusion. \n\nNow although the Face-Areas X, Y, Z, and R do not define a Tetrahedron we \ndo have the following:\n\nTHE NEO-PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM:\n\n          If Tetrahedron QABC has a \"Right Corner\" at Q  (that is, if \n          Edges QA, QB, and QC are mutually perpendicular), then...\n\n                            2     2     2      2\n                           X  +  Y  +  Z   =  R\n          \n          (the Sum of the Squares of the Areas of the Leg-Faces is equal\n          to the Square of the Area of the Hypotenuse-Face).\n\n   PROOF. Exercise. It's pretty easy, requiring nothing more sophisticated\n          than Heron's Formula for Triangle Area.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Sadly, the Converse of this Theorem is not true... Having the \n           \"Sum of Squares\" relation does not guarantee the existence of\n           a Right Corner. Thus, there are \"Pythagorean Tetrahedra\" that\n           are not \"Right-Corner Tetrahedra\".\n \nCOMMENT 2: Happily, this idea extends to 'n' Dimensions as a Theorem for\n           an n-dimensional \"Right-Simplex\", where n mutually perpendicular \n           Edges meet at a Vertex.  But this is a story for another day.\n\nJust as the (ordinary) Pythagorean Theorem can be viewed as a special case \nof the Law of Cosines, so the Neo-Pythagorean Theorem is a special case of...\n\nTHE FIRST LAW OF COSINES  (\"LOC.1\"):\n\n             2     2   2   2  \n            R  =  X + Y + Z  - 2 Y Z cos QA - 2 Z X cos QB - 2 X Y cos QC\n\n   PROOF. Exercise.  This, too, is easy, though it involves a great deal\n          of symbol manipulation and a working knowledge of the formulae\n          from Spherical Trigonometry (in particular, a Law of Cosines!)\n          in order to relate Dihedral Angles to \"Face-Angles\" like &lt;AQB.\n\n COMMENT: When Q is a Right Corner, QA, QB, and QC are all Right Angles,\n          so that LOC.1 reduces to the Neo-Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nBy Symmetry, we can find similar expressions for X^2, Y^2, and Z^2 in terms\nof other Faces and \"opposite\" Dihedral Angles. The four expressions combine\nto give...\n\nTHE SECOND LAW OF COSINES (\"LOC.2\"):\n\n            2    2                      2     2    2\n           R  + X  -  2 X R cos BC  =  H  =  Y  + Z  -  2 Y Z cos QA\n \n            2    2                      2     2    2\n           R  + Y  -  2 Y R cos AC  =  J  =  Z  + X  -  2 Z X cos QB\n\n            2    2                      2     2    2\n           R  + Z  -  2 Z R cos AB  =  K  =  X  + Y  -  2 X Y cos OC\n\nCOMMENT 1: Notice that Faces R &amp; X \"bound\" Angle BC, and Faces Y &amp; Z \"bound\"\n           Angle QA;  moreover, BC and QA are \"opposite\" one another in the\n           Tetrahedron.  Similar observations hold for the other Equations.\n\nCOMMENT 2: There is a geometric interpretation of the numbers H, J, and K.\n           They are the Areas of \"Pseudo-Faces\", and can be calculated by:\n\n                      &lt;QA&gt;x&lt;BC&gt;         &lt;QB&gt;x&lt;CA&gt;         &lt;QC&gt;x&lt;AB&gt; \n                  H = ---------     J = ---------     K = ---------\n                          2                 2                 2\n\n           Where 'x' is the Cross Product.  This fact isn't very important\n           now, but it will aid discussion later.  Also, using H^2, J^2, \n           and K^2 as they are used in LOC.2 will help with simplification.\n\nCOROLLARY to LOC.2:\n                       2     2     2     2     2     2     2\n                      X  +  Y  +  Z  +  R  =  H  +  J  +  K\n\n  PROOF. Simply set the sum of the second column from the statment of \n         LOC.2 equal to the sum of the third column, then simplify using\n         the statement of LOC.1.\n\nOkay, so now we know that all information about a Tetrahedron can be gleaned\nfrom six Numbers:  X, Y, Z, R, H, J, and K, with the Corollary making one of \nthese Numbers (you choose) unnecessary.  These Areas and \"Pseudo-Areas\" give\nus Dihedral Angles, by LOC.2;  the Dihedral Angles give us Face-Angles, by\nSpherical Trigonometry;  and Face Angles together with Face Areas give us \nlengths of Edges.  Unfortunately, all 6 of these Area Numbers are virtually \nindependent of one another (but subject to a 'Triangle Inequality' of sorts).\nHowever, with \"Perfect Tetrahedra\" (defined below), we get a situation in \nwhich X, Y, Z, and R suffice to determine all information about the Tetra-\nhedron. \n\nDEFINITION: A _Perfect_Tetrahedron_ QABC is a Tetrahedron whose opposing\n            Edges are orthogonal (when thought of as Vectors).  That is,\n            if  &lt;UV&gt;  represents the Vector going through Points U and V\n            and '.' represents the Euclidean Dot-Product, then\n\n                     &lt;QA&gt;.&lt;BC&gt; = &lt;QB&gt;.&lt;CA&gt; = &lt;QC&gt;.&lt;AB&gt; = 0\n\n     NOTE:  In a Perfect Tetrahedron, the Pseudo-Faces can be computed as\n\n                      |QA||BC|       |QB||CA|       |QC||AB|\n                  H = --------   J = --------   K = --------\n                         2               2             2\n\nThe following Lemma and its Corollary will be useful.\n\n    LEMMA: Let UQV be the Angle between Edges (Vectors) QU and QV.\n\n           In a Perfect Tetrahedron QABC,\n\n                        cos BQC       cos CQA       cos AQB\n                       ---------  =  ---------  =  ---------\n                          |QA|          |QB|          |QC|\n\n    PROOF: Vector methods handle this nicely, although High School Trig\n           can do the job as well.\n\n COROLLARY to LEMMA:\n\n        The Face Angles at a Corner of a Perfect Tetrahedron are either\n        all Acute, all Right, or all Obtuse;  further, a Perfect Tetra-\n        hedron can have _at most_ one \"Right\" Corner or \"Obtuse\" Corner.\n\nBy this Corollary, we may assume that Q is not a Right Corner. Therefore,\nwe may use the Lemma to write:\n\n   |QA| = k cos BQC,  |QB| = k cos CQA,  |QC| = k cos AQB,   for some  k.\n\nUsing these facts, and the formulae for the Areas of X, Y, and Z,\n\n          |QB| |QC| sin BQC       |QC| |QA| sin CQA       |QA| |QB| sin AQB\n      X = -----------------,  Y = -----------------,  Z = -----------------, \n                  2                       2                       2\n                     \nwe can get\n\n     X    cos CQA sin BQC                       cos QB + cos QC cos QA\n    --- = --------------- = (by Spherical Trig) ----------------------\n     Y    cos BQC sin CQA                       cos QA + cos QB cos QC\n\n     Y    cos QC + cos QA cos QB    (      Z    cos QA + cos QB cos QC )\n    --- = ----------------------    (and  --- = ---------------------- ) \n     Z    cos QB + cos QC cos QA    (      X    cos QC + cos QA cos QB )\n\nNow, using the formulae for X/Y and Y/Z, as well as the Formula in LOC.1,\nwe can solve for cos QA, cos QB, and cos QC in terms of X, Y, Z, and R.\nThus, the Face Areas completely determine the Tetrahedron.

Fortunately, the P.T.E. is only Quartic, so that \nit is solvable by Radicals. _Un_fortunately, the Solutions look absolutely \nhideous, even when small values are substituted in for X, Y, Z, and R.\n\nIn an attempt to simplify the Solutions, one might try to simplify the \nEquation:\n\nOne obtains a slightly less complicated version of the P.T.E. by subsituting \n                        \n            2   2   2\n           X + Y - K\n      C = ------------ ( from the \"Definition of K\" in LOC.2 )  to get\n             2 X Y\n\n                        8         6   2   2   2   2   \n                     3 K   -   4 K ( X + Y + Z + R )\n\n   4 /   2   2   2   2  2       2   2     2    2         2    2     2   2 \\\n- K | ( X + Y + Z + R  ) - 2 ( X - R ) ( Y  - Z ) + 2 ( Y  - R ) ( Z - X ) |\n     \\                                                                    /\n\n                              2   2 2   2   2 2 \n                         - ( Z - R ) ( X - Y )   =  0\n\nObserve that this is a _Quartic_ in K^2 (and it has no \"linear\" term...is \nthis good?)  This is, essentially, one of the \"3 'Simple' Quartics\" from \nmy previous post (although in that post I had replaced X^2 with X, Y^2 \nwith Y, ... , and I also made some other variable assignments in an attempt \nto simplify things).\n\nBy cycling Variables\n\n        K -&gt; J -&gt; H -&gt; K  ,   Z -&gt; Y -&gt; X -&gt; Z  ,  R -&gt; R\n\nwe can transform the K^2-Quartic to a J^2-Quartic and the H^2-Quartic, \ncompleting the list of \"3 'Simple' Quartics\".  I mention these other two \nQuartics because, while the Solutions to any _one_ of them look hopelessly\ncomplex, we can observe that, since the Solutions must satisfy the simple\nrelation shown in the LOC.2 Corollary, there must be some method in the \nmadness. \n\nTo plead this case a little more convincingly, let me remind the Reader \nthat any Quartic Equation\n                          4     3     2\n                       a q + b q + c q + d q + e = 0,\n\nhas Roots of the form\n                              b\n                      q =  - --- + (**STUFF**)\n                             4a\n\nConsequently, the Solutions to the three P.T.E.'s have the form\n\n                            2   2   2   2\n                      2    X + Y + Z + R\n                     H  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.1**) \n                                 3\n\n                            2   2   2   2\n                      2    X + Y + Z + R\n                     J  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.2**)\n                                 3 \n\n                            2   2   2   2\n                      2    X + Y + Z + R\n                     K  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.3**)\n                                 3\n                                \nThis gives that\n\n    2   2   2     2   2   2   2\n   H + J + K  =  X + Y + Z + R   +  **STUFF.1** + **STUFF.2** + **STUFF.3**\n\nIn accordance with the Corollary to LOC.2, we can conclude that\n\n             **STUFF.1** + **STUFF.2** + **STUFF.3**  =  0\n\nNow, the **STUFF**'s are pretty complicated expressions, involving complex\nnumbers and nested Radicals.  But as complicated as these thing are, they \nMUST cancel each other out in the end, and this is encouraging.  Somehow, \nsome way, these **STUFF**'s can be artfully manipulated into expressions \nthat \"obviously\" cancel.  I have searched for over 5 years for this method \nof artful manipulation, but to no avail.  Maple hasn't been much help in \nthe general case:  I have waited for over an hour at a sitting for Maple \nto churn out even the _ugly_ Solutions to the P.T.E., but the task seems \nto require a great deal more time than I can spend waiting.\n\nLet's take a specific example to show the extent of the problem for even \nsimple numerical values:\n\n   Assign: X = 1 , Y = 2 , Z = 5 , R = 9.  \n\n  COMMENT: The values are chosen to avoid some special circumstances, and \n           in the hopes that they -as prime powers- might be 'recognizable' \n           inside a complicated expression.\n\nThese give the following P.T.E. system:\n\n                      8        6          4\n                   3 H  - 444 H  + 16353 H  - 2822400  =  0\n\n                      8        6          4\n                   3 J  - 444 J  + 15345 J  - 3415104  =  0\n\n                      8        6          4\n                   3 K  - 444 K  +  5265 K  -  28224   =  0\n\nMaple solves these Equations readily.

Comput., \n21 (Feb.1992) 85-110 -- explains Denesting and provides an algorithm for \ndenesting arbitrarily \"deep\" Radical Expressions. (I freely admit that I \ndo not fully comprehend the steps involved, but I have only begun to look \ninto this avenue of investigation.) I am not sure if the algorithm will \nreadily transfer to the general X-Y-Z-R case, since the steps require \nknowledge of Irreducible Polynomials and such things, which I should think \nwould be extremely difficult to determine when dealing with variables \ninstead of _numbers_.  At this point, I'd be happy to see the denested \nforms of the three Expressions above; examination of these might provide \nsome valuable insight to the general case, fostering a good guess or two\nthat could save a lot of time.\n\nHaving mentioned time, I find that perhaps I should not waste much more of \nthe Reader's.  I'll close up this post with a listing of some Special Case \nSolutions to the P.T.E.'s....Perhaps someone can discern the Grand Pattern \nfrom these scattered examples.  The Solutions for H^2, J^2, and K^2 are \nordered such that repective Solutions for these three quantities satisfy \nthe Corollary to LOC.2.

In the Root \n      List for each of H^2, J^2, and K^2 in the cases above, the last \n      three Roots can be considered extraneous. Let me explain.\n\n      Notice that if  H = 0, then (by the formula given for calculating \n      H from the Cross Product) either |QA| = 0  or  |BC| = 0; so either \n      Y = Z = 0 or X = R = 0. Similarly, if J = 0, then either X = Z = 0\n      or Y = R = 0;  and if  K = 0, then either  X = Y = 0 or Z = R = 0.\n\n      Now the Triso-hedral/Equi-hedral case, the '0' Roots for the triple\n      H, J, K imply that X = Y = Z = R = 0.  But in this case the formula \n      in the \"first\" entries of the Root List give us the answer.  Thus,\n      there is no need for the '0' entries.  Moreover, the \"second\" entry\n      is unnecessary since it simply copies the \"first\". \n\n      In the Doubly Biso-hedral case, H^2 can equal (X - R)^2 only if we\n      have X = Y = Z = R = 0, which means that H's value can be computed\n      from its \"first\" Root formula, and so can the corresponding values\n      of J and K;  similarly, for when J^2 = (X - R)^2.  So the last two\n      entries in these Root Lists are extraneous. Moreover, one can show\n      that  X^2 + R^2 - 2sqrt(X^4 - X^2*R^2 + R^2)  is non-positive, and\n      reaches zero only when X^2 = R^2; but if these are identical, then \n      the \"second\" Root formulae for H^2 and J^2 yield 0, so that we get\n      X = Y = Z = R = 0, and find that, again, the \"first\" Root formulae \n      suffice.\n\n      In the Pythagorean case, one can use arguments about Edges to show\n      that the Tetrahedron _must_ be a Right-Corner Tetrahedron;  that is,\n      the Neo-Pythagorean is an \"if and only if\" Proposition in the realm\n      of Perfect Tetrahedra. (Another nice thing about Perfect Tetrahedra!) \n      Thus, A = B = C = 0, and the \"first\" Roots give the Solutions, so we \n      don't even need the '**'s.\n\n      One can show that in the Flat Case, the Tetrahedron is in fact flat:\n      all Faces lie in the same Plane, and the Vertex Q lies at the Ortho-\n      centre of Face R. Here, H must be Y + Z, J must be X + Z, and K must\n      be X + Y (by Edge arguments).  The '**' Solutions in this case are\n      extraneous as well.\n\n      Is it true in general that 3 of the Solutions for each of H^2, J^2, \n      and K^2 are extraneous?  I don't know.  Numerical experimentation has \n      always lead to twelve values (all together) which could be grouped \n      into H-J-K triplets satisfying LOC.2.  Some of the numbers have been \n      negative or even complex which _does_ make them extraneous as Area-\n      Values. (In the numerical example above, it may be that the Imaginary\n      components are _supposed_ to be zero.) My GUESS is that there is only \n      one valid triplet (except in special cases where we have repeated \n      Roots), and that \"3/4\"s of each P.T.E. contains useless information,  \n      but I don't know for sure yet if that is the case.\n\nWell, anyway, that's about all I care to inflict upon you for now.  Anyone\ninterested in other aspects of Hedronometry (such as its analogue in \nHyperbolic Space among other things) should feel free to inquire.  I have\na little notebook full of bits and pieces (but nothing especially *deep*).\n\nLet me close now by saying that, although it is *trivial* Mathematics, \nHedronometry has been a pet project of mine since my High School Days.\nI've been struggling with various forms of the P.T.E. off and on for\nnearly 10 years, and I'd very much like to get its Solution pinned down.\nSo I appreciate all the help I can get in this matter.  Any questions,\ncomments, suggestions, or what-have-you's will be graciously accepted;\nagain, please respond by e-mail, so as not to use up even more bandwidth\non this subject.\n\nI thank you all for your time and tolerance.\n\nRegards,\n\nDon Mc Connell\n<A HREF=\"mailto:bdsm@fermat.wpi.edu\">bdsm@fermat.wpi.edu</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math.research\n<B>From:</B>           \"Greg Kuperberg\" &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:gk00@midway.uchicago.edu\">gk00@midway.uchicago.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Solve the Perfect Tetrahedron Equation!\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 12 Feb 1993 17:08:03 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Chicago\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nFor those who have not been following this discussion, Don describes a\ntetrahedron by the area of its four faces and the length of the cross\nproduct of every pair of opposite edges, and he wants an expression for\nthe dihedral angles.  He has also restricted to the case where every\npair of opposite edges is perpendicular and wants the dihedral angles\nin terms of the four areas.  The straightforward approach with vector\ncalculus in R^3 yields algebraic equations for the cosines of the\nangles that seem unnecessarily complicated.\n\nIn article &lt;1lcdgd$shl@bigboote.WPI.EDU&gt; you write:\n&gt;THE FIRST LAW OF COSINES  (\"LOC.1\"):\n&gt;\n&gt;             2     2   2   2  \n&gt;            R  =  X + Y + Z  - 2 Y Z cos QA - 2 Z X cos QB - 2 X Y cos QC\n&gt;\n&gt;   PROOF.

This, too, is easy, though it involves a great deal\n&gt;          of symbol manipulation and a working knowledge of the formulae\n&gt;          from Spherical Trigonometry...\n\nHere is another solution.  X,Y,Z, and R are your four areas, and let\ncAB be the cosine of the angle between faces with area A and B.  The\nkey to this equation is the shadow principle:  At high noon, a plate\nwith area A at an angle alpha from the ground casts a shadow of area\ncos(alpha) A.  By resting the tetrahedron on the ground on each \nface and applying the shadow principle, it follows that:\n\nR = cRX X + cRY Y + cRZ Z\nX = cRX R + cXY Y + cXZ Z\nY = cYX X + cRY R + cYZ Z\nZ = cZX X + cZY Y + cRZ R\n\nNow multiply each equation by the left-hand side and subtract the last\nthree equations from the first.\n\nThe real lesson here is that you can describe a tetrahedron by\na 4 x 4 symmetric matrix of numbers:\n\n(     R^2, -cRX R X, -cRY R Y, -cRZ R Z)\n(-cRX R X,      X^2, -cXY X Y, -cXZ X Z)\n(-cRY R Y, -cXY X Y,      Y^2, -cYZ Y Z)\n(-cRZ R Z, -cXZ X Z, -cYZ Y Z,      Z^2)\n\nAs long as all four rows add to zero and the matrix is positive\nsemidefinite (in other words v^T M v <U>&gt;</U> 0 always), it corresponds to an\nactual Euclidean tetrahedron.  Your three pseudo-areas (cross-products\nof opposite edges) should be somewhere in this matrix also, but I have\nto think about exactly where.

The statement  that the area vectors add up to  \nzero can be thought of as a limiting case of the statement that the  \nintegral of the normal vector of a smooth closed surface  with respect to  \nsurface area is zero, which can be deduced from Stokes's theorem. You can  \nget the polyhedral case directly from a suitably formulated version of  \nStokes's theorem. Essentially it means that if fluid is flowing at a   \nvelocity constant in space and time, as much fluid flows out of the  \ntetrahedron (or other solid) as flows into it. The vector area of the  \npseudoface tells you how much fluid crosses a surface which spans the skew  \nquadrilateral which divides the tetrahedron into two triangles, if the  \nfluid is flowing with unit speed and the best direction is chosen for its  \nvelocity vector.\nI hope Billy Don McConnell will post something about  tetrahedra in  \nhyperbolic space, as many people are interested in them.\n\n--\nGeoffrey Mess\nDepartment of Mathematics, UCLA\nLos Angeles, CA.\n<A HREF=\"mailto:geoff@math.ucla.edu\">geoff@math.ucla.edu</A>\nNeXTmail welcome.\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:hillman@math.washington.edu\">hillman@math.washington.edu</A> (Christopher Hillman)\n<B>Date:</B>           14 Jan 1997 12:57:19 GMT\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: finding volume of tetrahedron with one vertex at origin and others\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn article &lt;32DAA78E.7078@qlink.queensu.ca&gt;,\nPaul Turkstra &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:6pt@qlink.queensu.ca\">6pt@qlink.queensu.ca</A>&gt; writes:\n\n|&gt; How do I find the volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at the origin,\n|&gt; (1,2,0), (0,1,3) and (1,1,1) using determinants and the like?\n\nFrom a submission which apparently never made it into the FAQ for this\nnewsgroup:\n\nTHE VOLUME OF SIMPLICES\n\nSimplices (plural of ``simplex'') are convex bodies which generalize\nthe notions of triangles and tetrahedra to n-dimensional euclidean space,\nE^n.  A k-dimensional simplex has k+1 (affinely independent) vertices,\n(k+1)k/2! edges, (k+1)k(k-1)/3! two dimensional faces, and so forth up to\nk+1 (k-1)-dimensional faces.  Just as triangles can exist in E^3,\nk-simplices can exist in E^n for any n &gt;= k.\n\nAny convex polytope (the generalization of polygons and polyhedra to E^n)\ncan be partitioned into simplices (just as any convex polygon can be\npartitioned into triangles), so in principle if you can compute the volume\nof arbitrary simplices, you can compute the volume of any convex polytope.\n\nThere are several pretty and easily implemented formulae which give\nthe volume of a k-dimensional simplex sitting in euclidean n-space, S,\nin terms of different kinds of given information, such as the coordinates\nof the vertices  or the lengths of the edges.  These formulae can be used\nby anyone who knows how to compute a determinant, although software such\nas Mathematica will probably be needed to evaluate really large\ndeterminants.\n\nI will write Vol_k for ``k-dimensional volume'' (really k-dimensional\nLebesgue measure, for those who know what this means); thus Vol_1 means\nlength, Vol_2 means area, and so forth.  Unless stated otherwise, S\nwill denote a k-dimensional simplex in E^n, where n \\geq k.\nVol_k(S) will mean the k-dimensional volume of S.\nA hyperplane in E^n is an (n-1)-dimensional plane.\n\n1.

Thanks to David for archiving it as\npart of his impressive collection.\n\nI thought I would post two informational updates here:\n\nFirst:  I am no longer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute or the\nUniversity of Washington, by the way;  my current e-mail address\nis   mcconnel @ vvm . com (without the spaces ... I'm just a bit\nparanoid about address-harvesters).  Incidentally, I promised\nreferences to anyone who e-mailed me about the topic ... in the\nyears since the post, I've lost track of those references. Sorry.\n\nSecond:  I essentially \"solved\" the Perfect Tetrahedron Equations\n(PTEs) recently.  At least, I solved something equivalent to the\nproblem posed by them:  I found a Heron-like formula that gives\nthe volume of a perfect tetrahedron in terms of the areas of its\nfaces.  (A \"perfect\" tetrahedron is one whose pairs of opposite\nedges determine pairs of orthogonal vectors.)  With face areas\nand volume known, various substitutions into other formulae can\nyield things like dihedral and face angles, and areas of \"pseudo-\nfaces\" (the primary target of the previously posted PTEs);  thus,\nall aspects of a Perfect Tetrahedron are derivable from the areas\nof its faces.\n\nMy solution isn't explicit, but is encoded in a single quartic,\ninstead of the four I'd given before;  the one quartic is far more\ncomplicated to express than the other four, but I haven't done a\ngreat deal of analysis to see what I can fix up.\n\nHere 'tis:\n\n   Let X, Y, Z, and R  be the areas of faces of a perfect\n   tetrahedron, and let  W = 81 * volume^4 .  Then  W  is the\n   root of the following \"Heron Quartic\":\n\n 0 = 27 W^4\n\n  - W^3 * (        &lt;&lt; 6, 0, 0, 0 &gt;&gt;  -  33 &lt;&lt; 4, 2, 0, 0 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  + 114 &lt;&lt; 2, 2, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;                          )\n\n  - W^2 * (        &lt;&lt;10, 2, 0, 0 &gt;&gt;  -   4 &lt;&lt; 8, 4, 0, 0 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  -  43 &lt;&lt; 8, 2, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;  +   6 &lt;&lt; 6, 6, 0, 0 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  +  42 &lt;&lt; 6, 4, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;  + 408 &lt;&lt; 6, 2, 2, 2 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  - 204 &lt;&lt; 4, 4, 4, 0 &gt;&gt;  - 218 &lt;&lt; 4, 4, 2, 2 &gt;&gt;  )\n\n  - W   * (        &lt;&lt;14, 2, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;  -   6 &lt;&lt;12, 4, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  -  57 &lt;&lt;12, 2, 2, 2 &gt;&gt;  +  15 &lt;&lt;10, 6, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  +  18 &lt;&lt;10, 4, 4, 0 &gt;&gt;  + 165 &lt;&lt;10, 4, 2, 2 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  -  20 &lt;&lt; 8, 8, 2, 0 &gt;&gt;  -  12 &lt;&lt; 8, 6, 4, 0 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  + 109 &lt;&lt; 8, 6, 2, 2 &gt;&gt;  - 398 &lt;&lt; 8, 4, 4, 2 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  -   6 &lt;&lt; 6, 6, 6, 0 &gt;&gt;  + 478 &lt;&lt; 6, 6, 4, 2 &gt;&gt;  )\n          (  - 324 &lt;&lt; 6, 4, 4, 4 &gt;&gt;                          )\n\n  - X^2 Y^2 Z^2 R^2 (X+Y+Z-R)^2 (X+Y-Z+R)^2 (X-Y+Z+R)^2 (-X+Y+Z+R)^2\n                  * (X+Y-Z-R)^2 (X-Y+Z-R)^2 (X-Y-Z+R)^2 ( X+Y+Z+R)^2\n\n(I hope I've caught all of the typos.)\n\nHere, &lt;&lt;a, b, c, d&gt;&gt; := SUM A^a B^b C^c D^d , with the sum taken\nover all permutations ABCD of XYZR.\n\nAlthough the cubic, quadratic, and linear coefficients are fairly\nunenlightening when expanded in this way, I'll point out that the\nconstant term expands to something far worse;  I'm hoping that the\nother coefficients can be \"reasonably\" expressed in a more compact\nform.

It's interesting that this approach seems to invariably \nlead to a quartic equation (although yours is the first I've seen \nwhere the quartic is in terms of the volume itself, rather than\none of the edge lengths).  \n\n================================================================\nIn general there is no complete generalization of Heron's formula\ngiving the volume of a general tetrahedron in terms of the areas\nof its faces, because the face areas don't uniquely determine the\nvolume (in contrast to the case of triangles, where the three\nedge lengths determine the area).\n\nHowever, it IS possible to derive a \"Heron's formula\" for \ntetrahedrons if we restrict ourselves to just those that would \nfit as the \"hypotenuse face\" of a right 4D solid.  (Notice that \nEVERY triangle is the face of a right tetrahedron, which explains\nwhy Heron's formula is complete for triangles).\n\nTo review, remember that Heron's formula for triangles is essentially\nequivalent to Pythagoras' Theorem for right tetrahedrons.  If A_xyo,\nA_xoz, and A_oyz denote the areas of the three orthogonal faces of a\nright tetrahedron, and A_xyz denotes the area of the \"hypotenuse \nface\", then it's easy to show that\n\n   (A_xyz)^2  =  (A_xyo)^2  +  (A_xoz)^2  +  (A_oyz)^2         (1)\n\nThis is not only a generalization of Pythagoras's Theorem, it's also\nessentially Heron's formula for triangles.  Note that if a,b,c denote\nthe three orthogonal edge lengths of the tetrahedron, then the areas\nA_xyo, A_xoz, and A_oyz are simply  ab/2, ac/2, and bc/2. Furthermore,\nthe edges of the hypotenuse face d,e,f are directly related to a,b,c\naccording to the 2D Pythagorean theorem\n\n                     a^2 + b^2  = d^2\n                     a^2 + c^2  = e^2                         (2)\n                     b^2 + c^2  = f^2\n\nso we can express the squares of the areas A_xyo, A_xoz, A_oyz in\nequation (1) in terms of d^2, e^2, and f^2 to give the ordinary\nHeron's formula explicitly.\n\nIncidentally, it might be (and has been) argued that this derivation\ndoes not apply to obtuse triangles, because the \"hypotenuse face\" of\na right tetrahedron is necessarily acute (i.e., each of its angles \nmust be less than 90 degrees).  However, ANY triangle can be the \nhypotenuse face of a right tetrahedron, provided the orthogonal edge\nlengths and areas are allowed to be imaginary.  (It's interesting\nto speculate on whether the ancient Greeks might have been aware of \nthis aspect of the problem.)\n\nAnyway, we can do the same thing for tetrahedrons based on the\ngeneralized Pythagorean theorem for volumes of *right* 4D solids\n\n (V_wxyz)^2 = (V_wxyo)^2 + (V_wxoz)^2 + (V_woyz)^2 + (V_oxyz)^2   (3)\n\nIf we let a,b,c,d denote the orthogonal edge lengths of the 4D\nsolid, then the volumes of the four orthogonal \"faces\" are simply\nabc/6, abd/6, acd/6, and bcd/6, so equation (3) can be rewritten\nas\n\n (V_wxyz)^2 = (abc/6)^2 + (abd/6)^2 + (acd/6)^2 + (bcd/6)^2      (3')\n\nAlso, the areas of the four faces of our \"hyoptenuse\" solid can be \nexpressed in terms of a,b,c,d by means of the 3D Pythagorean theorem\n\n         (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2 = 4(A_1)^2\n         (ab)^2 + (ad)^2 + (bd)^2 = 4(A_2)^2                     (4)\n         (ac)^2 + (ad)^2 + (cd)^2 = 4(A_3)^2\n         (bc)^2 + (bd)^2 + (cd)^2 = 4(A_4)^2\n\nThus, given the four face areas A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, we have four\nequations in the four unknowns a,b,c,d, so we can solve for these\nvalues and then compute the area using (3').\n\nThis is the point at which people usually turn away from this\napproach, for two reasons: [1] everything we're doing is restricted\nto the special tetrahedrons that can serve as the hypotenuse of a \n\"right\" 4D simplex, so we're certainly not going to end up with a \ngeneral formula applicable to every tetrahedron (and such formulas \nare already available anyway via the usual determinants), and [2] it\nturns out to be somewhat messy to solve the set of equations (4).\n\nPressing on anyway, we can reduce (4) to a single quartic in the\nsquare of any of the four variables a,b,c or d.  Arbitrarily\nselecting c, and letting A,B,C,D denote 4 times the squares of\nthe face areas (i.e., the right hand sides of equations (4)),\nwe can express the quartic in x=c^2 with coefficients that are\nfunctions of B and the elementary symmetric functions of A,C,D\n\n       s1 = A+C+D       s2 = AC+AD+CD      s3 = ACD\n\nIn these terms the quartic for x=c^2 is\n\n                                                  [12B] x^4 \n                       +   [3s1^2 - 12s2 + 14Bs1 - B^2] x^3\n     +  [2B(s1^2 + 6s2) - B^2 s1 - s1^3 + 4s1s2 - 36s3] x^2\n + [2B(s1s2 + 6s3) - B^2 s2 + 4s2^2 - s1^2 s2 - 12s1s3] x\n                                        - [s3 (s1-B)^2]   =   0\n\nOf course, the analagous quartics can be given for a^2, b^2, and\nd^2, but once we have any one of them we can more easily compute\nthe others.  For example, given c we can compute b from the relation\n                          ___________________\n                         / (c^2 + A)(c^2 + D)\n           b = -c  +-   / -------------------\n                      \\/      (c^2 + C)\n\nand the values of a and d follow easily, allowing us to compute\nthe volume using equation (3').  It would be nice if we could express\nthe volume as an explicit function of the face areas, but I don't\nknow if such a formula exists.\n  _______________________________________________________________\n |  MathPages  /*\\     <A HREF=\"http://www.seanet.com/~ksbrown/\">http://www.seanet.com/~ksbrown/</A>           |\n |            /   \\                                              |\n |___________/\"I know thee not, old man.
