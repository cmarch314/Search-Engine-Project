{"text": "R Lab 1 Assignment You should review the Introduction to R and RStudio from last week before attempting this lab assignment Instructions This is a pair programming assignment so find a partner to work with at the beginning of discussion You will turn in one lab assignment between the two of you and both of you will receive the same score Use one laptop between the two of you and take turns being the driver and the navigator If there are an odd number of students in discussion or you cannot find a partner see your TA If you do not attend discussion you must find a partner to work with outside of class The TA will pass around a lab attendance sheet on which you should write your name and your partner s name You must submit your lab assignment through the EEE Dropbox tool following the instructions found here A separate dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments This lab assignment is due Wednesday Oct 22 by 11am You must include all relevant R code used to answer the questions Partner evaluation forms will be available online via EEE Survey after completing and turning in the lab assignment Filling out the partner evaluation form is required of each student submitting a lab assignment Evaluations will be kept confidential your partner will never see what you wrote in your evaluation Problem 1 Practice with the sample function Recall that the sample function in R takes a sample of specified size from the elements given in its first argument Look up the help file for the sample function Explain what the argument replace does in the sample function Use the sample function to simulate five rolls of a six sided fair die Suppose you have a population of 1 people where 5 are Democrat 3 are Republican and 2 are Independent How many Democrats would you expect to get in a simple random sample of 1 people from this population Use the sample function to simulate taking a simple random sample of 1 people from this population where you only record the person s political preference D R or I How many Democrats did you get in your sample How does this compare to your answer in part i Problem 2 The classic hat problem Suppose n people go to a fancy restaurant Each person is wearing a hat and checks his her hat at the door as he she arrives The hat check attendant gets tipsy throughout the evening forgetting which hat belongs to whom and returns a random hat to each person as they leave The patrons leave in a random order Conduct a simulation in R to answer the following questions Assume n 5 Calculate an empirical probability that no one gets his or her own hat back Use this to also estimate the probability that at least one patron gets his or her own hat back Still assuming n 5 calculate the empirical mean average number of patrons who get their own hats back Repeat parts a and b using n 2 How do you think the probability of at least one match will change if there are 5 people How do you think the average number of matches will change with 5 people Test your guesses by repeating the simulation with 5 hats and people Try the simulation for larger and larger values of n to get an estimate of the limits for the probability of no one getting his her hat back and for the average number of patrons who get their hats back We will derive the exact probability of no one getting his her hat back in class exp 1 You can check your simulation by checking if your simulated answer is close to the exact answer Hints for Problem 2 You will need to simulate returning the hats at random many many times 1 times or more keeping track of how many patrons got their hat back on each trial Try to write R code to perform the following steps Set up an empty vector to store the result of each trial in the end this will be a vector of non negative integers representing the number of patrons who got their hat back on each trial Within a for loop for each trial generate two random permutations of size n the sample function will come in handy here One represents the random order in which the patrons leave the other the random order in which the hats are returned Teaser if the hats are returned in random order does it matter in which order the patrons leave Compute the number of matches and save it in the vector created in step 1 Once the for loop runs you can calculate the proportion of times that the number of matches was greater than zero and the mean number of matches over all trials Run your simulation several times to get an idea of how variable your results are Stats 12 A Index", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~staceyah/120A/labs/Lab1.html", "title": "lab 1: assignment", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta content=\"text/html;
