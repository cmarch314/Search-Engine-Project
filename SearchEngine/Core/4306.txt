384 4 9 1994 special issue for 31st FOCS In this paper we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input As a result we can guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded away from zero using a number of triangles within a constant of optimal this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh element quality and mesh complexity of this form and therefore the first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input geometries and the quality of its output In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets so that all angles are non obtuse using linearly many triangles and to triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and a number of simplices within a constant of optimal Also we can augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation has linear complexity In later follow up work I showed that the same technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of optimal Bern Mitchell and Ruppert showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon without obtuse angles see Faster circle packing with application to nonobtuse triangulation for an algorithmic improvement to their technique

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting two terminals in a graph allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage dominated by a single source shortest path computation The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph where k is a parameter given as input to the algorithm The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems network routing hypothesis generation in computational linguistics and sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in bioinformatics Although there have been many papers on the k shortest paths problem before and after this one it has become frequently cited in those application areas Additionally it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could be solved a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time bounds of this paper Subsequent work has focused instead on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated vertices and

issue on treewidth graph minors and algorithms This paper introduces the diameter treewidth property later known as bounded local treewidth a functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth Previously known results imply that planar graphs have bounded local treewidth we characterize the other minor closed families with this property Specifically minor closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there exists an apex graph G that is not in F an apex graph is a graph that can be made planar by removing a single vertex The minor free families that exclude an apex graph and therefore have bounded local treewidth include the bounded genus graphs for which as with planar graphs we show a linear bound for the treewidth as a function of the diameter and K3 a free graphs As a consequence subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and approximations to several NP hard optimization problems can be computed efficiently on these graphs extending previous results for planar graphs Some of these results were announced in the conference version of subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related problems but not included in the

We use this\nconstruction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of\nall 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges\nare represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.\nWe also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble\nclusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
