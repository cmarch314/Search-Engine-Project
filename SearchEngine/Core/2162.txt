Both are the same price. The Online Format will allow you to view the book from any computer that has a live Internet connection. The Downloadable Format will allow you to download the book to a single computer but not to make copies of the file; it will require you to install CourseSmart Bookshelf software. Some students prefer the online format because it does not require installation of any software; other students prefer the downloadable format because it may be faster to flip pages.
