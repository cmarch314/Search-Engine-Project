perfectly equilateral triangle but mathematicians have not yet agreed on the dimensions of a perfectly scalene triangle I was going to propose one where the sides are 1 2 and 3 units long as I think that would be a pretty cool triangle what with side B being twice side A and side C being three times A and 5 improved over B Also the angle opposite C would have over ten trijillion times as many degrees plus some radians too as any of the other two angles which would be so sharp you wouldn t be able to see them before you accidentally tried to pick the triangle up But then I realized that what makes a 1 2 3 triangle so excitingly scalene is that two sides are much longer than one of the other sides Wouldn t it be even better if side C was to B as B is to A Therefore let s try 1 2 4
