UPDATE Winners of AppJam Winter 2 12 were announced March 6 Congratulations to Team Socially Awkward Anteaters for their app AwkTalk which facilitates in person meetings where two users participate in a timed topic discussion based on their preferences then rate each other s social skills through the app s prescribed categories Stay tuned for full coverage of the latest AppJam tournament Bren School students build apps in one week Eight teams of Bren School students with varying levels of programming experience ranging from proficient to none created fully functional mobile applications or apps in just one week as part of the inaugural ICS Student Council AppJam Tournament The challenge Create a mobile app that will improve the lives of UC Irvine students academically professionally and socially The results Apps ranging from the grand prize winner TimeToGo which alerts users of their appointments at a time appropriate to their location to second place finisher ZotPark which enables users to easily navigate the UCI parking system and third place winner Groups a way for students to keep track of their social and academic circles The ICS Student Council thought AppJam would be a great way for students to learn or master coding skills while gaining real life team project experience said ICSSC project management coordinator Nikola Metulev a fourth year Computer Science and Engineering major In honor of CSEdWeek we also encouraged participants to build an app that would be appealing to middle and high school students The competition kicked off Nov 14 and the judging event which featured presentations and demos took place Nov 22 Judges included John Libby cofounder of MobilityWare Farsheed Atef chief technology officer and cofounder of Drumbi and faculty members Michael Franz Dan Frost and Shannon Tauro Student peers also participated in the voting process The entire tournament was amazing Tauro said My fellow judges and I were very impressed by what Bren School students were able to learn and accomplish during a very short and busy time in the quarter According to Metulev most teams plan to add features to their apps before posting them to the Android market Select apps may also be available for download from the AppJam website in January ICSSC plans to organize the next AppJam Tournament during winter quarter View the Bren School s Flickr page for

lead Yuen Hei Lam Kevin Lee Jared Leung and Alexis Hoshino App description Ever wonder how long it will take to get to class from your current location on campus TimeToGo is an Android app sensitive to user location when issuing calendar reminders The app also provides a searching capability and the ability to see friends schedules Future goals for the team include implementing a tool on the app that takes into account multiple means of transportation Team comment We learned to accommodate for everyone s busy schedules by holding meetings through Skype and Facebook rather than meeting in person Another valuable lesson this project reinforced was to let no one s talents go to waste Even though we are all coming from different programming skill levels we all wanted to contribute to the best of our abilities for the sake of our common goal ZotPark 2nd place Prize 3 and Google bags Members Chelsea Clark lead Derek Liang Kevin Jonaitis Myron Lozano and Delian Petrov App description Designed to help students navigate the UCI parking system ZotPark allows users to look up valid locations to park based on their permit type ZotPark can also determine and display extra parking lots and structures available to the user depending on time of day Additionally the app provides information about parking lots and permit types as well as navigation capabilities When I was new to campus I spent 2 minutes driving up and down Peltason looking for Lot 17A and no one could help me find it said Clark But this app can Team comment We met every day for two to three hours We had little to no coding experience but we pulled through with research hard work and adrenaline Groups 3rd place Prize 1 and Android watches Members Marc Touchette lead Richard Creencia Alex Taylor Won Kim and Weiwei Jiang App description Allows users to create and join study or social groups and makes the information available to them from any Android phone Within Groups users can access information like name email and phone numbers It s much more compact and discreet than Facebook because it doesn t carry your life story said Touchette Team comment This application could convince middle school students that studying computing is cool because it will allow them to keep track of their groups too With more and more kids using smart phones and no longer memorizing numbers this app will allow them to easily keep track of their friends numbers or look up the numbers of their friends from a different phone OTHER PARTICIPANTS Peter s Organizer Members Nithin Jilla lead Matthew Ito Quan Nguyen Daryl Alfaro and Ashwin Amit App description Peter s Organizer is a calendar Android app that lists events specific to the Bren School Events are categorized as academic social or professional and could be added by students either through their phone or a web page Users may filter events by category Team comment Many Bren School students find out about jobs through events such as company visits We wanted an easier way for students to find about these school events so we thought this calendar would be useful We then decided to expand this idea to include academic events and social events as well Metis Members Orson Teodoro lead Peter Cao Justin Krakes and Sohrob Raja App description Metis functions as an interactive scheduling tool allowing users to coordinate their schedule with friends family and fellow students through a visual timeline feature Users may sync their schedules with another user through the merge feature Team comment The app was inspired by our need to coordinate free time to get together to work on the app ICS Earth Members Johnson Liu lead Zhihang Xiao Alexander Richberg Jonathan Stroud and Pramodh Gopal App description ICS Earth was developed to help Bren School students locate professors and events on campus The app allows users to search through a list of professors by name phone number office location or department and through a list of events by name date time location or category The application also includes a campus map as a reference point Team comment We really wanted to emphasize simplicity Simple Scheduler Members Matthew Thornton lead Hongde Jin Ryan Sullivant Irvin Huang and Phillip Huang App description Allows students to input their classes and information assignments pertaining to each class Team comment Networking with our peers was one of the best parts of this project since we are now able to call upon each other for help or to hang out Anteater Events Members Tri Pham lead Chris Miliotti Brett Buford Ki Lee Kelly Yin and Siripen Pongpaichet App description Displays university activities to users The activities can be user created through the application and generated from RSS feeds around UCI Users may view and join upcoming events and invite other users to the event Team comment Creating an app in one week was significantly more difficult than expected but worthwhile Reported by Courtney Hamilton Photos by Peter

Judges included John Libby, cofounder of MobilityWare, Farsheed Atef, chief technology officer and cofounder of Drumbi, and faculty members Michael Franz, Dan Frost and Shannon Tauro. Student peers also participated in the voting process. \n</p>\n<p>&#8220;The entire tournament was amazing,&#8221; Tauro said. &#8220;My fellow judges and I were very impressed by what Bren School students were able to learn and accomplish during a very short and busy time in the quarter.&#8221; \n</p>\n<p>\nAccording to Metulev, most teams plan to add features to their apps before posting them to the Android market. Select apps may also be available for download from the AppJam <a href=\"http://appjam.roboteater.com/\" title=\"AppJam\">website</a> in January. ICSSC plans to organize the next AppJam Tournament during winter quarter.</p>\n<p>\nView the Bren School's Flickr \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brenschool/sets/72157628114485315/\">page</a> \nfor photos from the judging event. \nClick \n<a href=\"http://ocunwired.ocregister.com/2011/11/23/uci-students-build-app-in-a-week/12222/\">here</a>\nfor the Orange County Register story about the winning team.\n</p>\n<h3>FALL 2011 APPJAM WINNERS:</h3>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p class=\"image_with_wrapped_text\">\n<img alt=\"TimeToGo\" class=\"right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/spotlight_appjam/AppJam_TimeToGo.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<p><b>&#8220;TimeToGo&#8221;<br/><b>1st place</b>&#160;</b> \n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Prize:</b> $500 and lunch at Google<br/>\n<b>Members:</b> Adithya Gajulapally (lead), Yuen Hei Lam, Kevin Lee, Jared Leung and Alexis Hoshino<br/>\n<b>App description:</b> Ever wonder how long it will take to get to class from your current location on campus? TimeToGo is an Android app sensitive to user location when issuing calendar reminders. The app also provides a searching capability and the ability to see friends&#8217; schedules. Future goals for the team include implementing a tool on the app that takes into account multiple means of transportation.<br/>\n<b>Team comment:</b> &#8220;We learned to accommodate for everyone's busy schedules by holding meetings through Skype and Facebook, rather than meeting in person. Another valuable lesson this project reinforced was to let no one's talents go to waste. Even though we are all coming from different programming skill levels, we all wanted to contribute to the best of our abilities for the sake of our common goal.&#8221;\n</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p class=\"image_with_wrapped_text\">\n<img alt=\"ZotPark\" class=\"right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/spotlight_appjam/AppJam_ZotPark.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<p><b>&#8220;ZotPark&#8221;<br/><b>2nd place</b>&#160;</b>\n</p>\n<p><b>Prize:</b> $300 and Google bags<br/>\n<b>Members:</b> Chelsea Clark (lead), Derek Liang, Kevin Jonaitis, Myron Lozano and Delian Petrov<br/>\n<b>App description:</b> Designed to help students navigate the UCI parking system, ZotPark allows users to look up valid locations to park based on their permit type. ZotPark can also determine and display extra parking lots and structures available to the user, depending on time of day. Additionally, the app provides information about parking lots and permit types, as well as navigation capabilities. &#8220;When I was new to campus, I spent 20 minutes driving up and down Peltason looking for Lot 17A and no one could help me find it,&#8221; said Clark. &#8220;But this app can.&#8221; <br/>\n<b>Team comment:</b> &#8220;We met every day for two to three hours.

With more and more kids using smart phones and no longer memorizing numbers, this app will allow them to easily keep track of their friends' numbers, or look up the numbers of their friends from a different phone.&#8221;\n</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<h3>OTHER PARTICIPANTS:</h3>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p class=\"image_with_wrapped_text\">\n<img alt=\"Peter's Organizer\" class=\"right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/spotlight_appjam/AppJam_Peters_Organizer.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>&#8220;Peter&#8217;s Organizer&#8221;</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Members:</b> Nithin Jilla (lead), Matthew Ito, Quan Nguyen, Daryl Alfaro and Ashwin Amit<br/>\n<b>App description:&#160;</b>Peter&#8217;s Organizer is a calendar Android app that lists events specific to the Bren School.

We wanted an easier way for students to find about these school events, so we thought this calendar would be useful.
