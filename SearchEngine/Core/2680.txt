we describe our effort at developing and demonstrating a prototype knowledge based Web environment for modeling diagnosing and redesigning complex business processes Our goal was to investigate how a modern knowledge representation system Loom MB95 can favorably leverage the development and evolution of a knowledge web that links narrative informal and formal descriptions of on line cases on business process redesign In so doing we demonstrate concepts techniques and tools that facilitate the development of a knowledge web management system KWMS in an application domain of interest to enterprises throughout the world We start with a brief background discussion of commercial approaches to knowledge management as well as to introduce our conception of knowledge webs and knowledge web management systems We next describe three problems that drive our investigation The problems are how to acquire global knowledge for how to redesign complex business processes how to develop knowledge representation and operationalization methods that utilize Web resources and technologies and how to facilitate the continuing evolution and improvement of a knowledge web for business process reengineering In response we present a strategy for how to address these problems in a way that combines the capabilities of a large knowledge acquisition team with intelligent systems technologies and the Web This includes how Web resources and knowledge based systems were used the kinds of classification taxonomies that were developed and how relevant domain and instance level knowledge was formally represented In particular we show how we used Loom and its corresponding Web browser interface Ontosaurus in developing a KWMS Our results demonstrate that an evolving knowledge web can be developed and supported by automated reasoning analysis and classification mechanisms to incrementally integrate new domain facts and to derive implied relations Our conclusions then follow Background Knowledge management KM within modern or virtual enterprises is an emerging area for research investigations as well as for the development and deployment of commercially available systems O98 Commercial systems like Lotus Notes focus on capturing and managing unstructured information that is created and shared by people in enterprises This information serves as a narrative knowledge base that is to be organized and managed Other systems from KM tool vendors such as Autonomy Inc and InXight Inc provide computational mechanisms that process unstructured information in a Lotus Notes text base or corporate Intranet repository These mechanisms add value by automatically constructing category word phrases or co occurrences hierarchies and hypertext indices links that characterize a set of related documents This is possible in that these mechanisms employ term clustering or classification techniques based on statistical information theoretic and linguistic analyses of a text database By their very nature text analysis techniques such as these provide their value through a shallow syntactic or surface level processing of a document or text base However this value can be enhanced through use of synonym tables thesauri domain keyword vocabularies or other weak models to augment the analyses Nonetheless these significant capabilities are now commercially available to enterprises that want to begin to manage their text based knowledge assets On the research front much work in KM remains to be done that builds on results from knowledge engineering reasoning and problem solving mechanisms and other aspects of intelligent systems Here classic problems in knowledge acquisition representation and operationalization must be addressed as they must by commercial KM systems As noted above commercial KM system can employ weak models to great success in acquiring and representing via hypertext links interrelated text documents that can be operationalized distributed and navigated through Web browsers and repository servers But there is little use of knowledge engineering reasoning or intelligent systems techniques in commercial KM tools In contrast our effort builds from these techniques One of the keys to understanding the current emphasis on unstructured information is to realize there is a wide range of levels of formalization in the ways knowledge is represented in KM systems At the same time the level of formalization or structure of the knowledge source restricts the mechanisms available to manipulate it provide services and solve problems This is presented in Figure 1 Figure 1 The Knowledge dimension forms and mechanisms Along the top is a sort of the notational forms in which knowledge can be captured and represented From left to right we increase the formalization and precision of knowledge while from right to left we accommodate more informality and ambiguity Knowledge forms towards the left end are relatively easy for people to create and update while knowledge forms to the right increasingly demand knowledge engineering incremental analysis and truth maintenance capability Along the bottom is a sort of representative knowledge processing tools or mechanisms From left to right we note an increase in the ability to derive some semantic interpretation from an associated knowledge form from co occurrence of specified keywords to logical expressions and deductive assertions Conversely from right to left we increase the amount and diversity of information we can search or browse for relevant knowledge Clearly most knowledge found on the Web is towards the left end Further most of the KM tools concentrate on the left half In this study we seek to broaden this scope by organizing interrelating and managing business process redesign knowledge that spans this dimension The research in this article is focused on the domain of business process redesign or BPR BPR involves the transformation of enterprise processes information infrastructure work situations and surrounding resources into more optimal configurations BPR is in many ways a precursor of KM in enterprises from historical organizational and technological perspectives DP98 Though much has been written about BPR and hundreds of BPR case studies have appeared in print and on the Web there has been little effort at developing an underlying formalization as to what constitutes BPR For example an initial effort classify and retrieve relevant cases has been demonstrated using case based reasoning techniques on a set of eight cases represented as attribute value tuples KS96 Other notable efforts employ knowledge based capabilities to help redesign specific business processes N97 ST96 Nonetheless there has been progress in developing concepts techniques and tools for formalizing and engineering enterprise processes for business and software development from a knowledge based perspective MS96 N97 SM97 In addition this progress with enterprise process technology has also led to the integration and use of Web technologies SN97 Finally we have an existing process modeling ontology available to us MS96 We thus use our existing enterprise process ontology and domain expertise as the starting point for representing knowledge about BPR Subsequently we choose to acquire and represent knowledge of BPR from case studies found on the Web By combining formalized knowledge representations for enterprise processes with Web technologies we make a move towards the development of intelligent support tools for managing BPR knowledge over the Web Our goal in this study is to acquire and represent a knowledge web for BPR that is operationalized and managed by a prototype knowledge web management system KWMS The knowledge web is the target knowledge base we wish to acquire and represent the environment for operationalizing and managing this knowledge works as a KWMS Problems In order to realize our research goal we must address three problems The first problem is how to acquire global knowledge for how to redesign complex business processes Our solution entails a number of activities We start by using popular search engines and index servers available on the Web Using keywords such as business process redesign process reengineering and case studies we quickly locate hundreds of links to possible sources of BPR knowledge cases Of course given the variability in the precision and recall of these information retrieval services a substantial effort is needed to browse filter and select BPR narratives that can subsequently be coded and classified as useful cases As a result we employed a group of 3 graduate students participating in a graduate seminar on BPR to browse filter select code and classify the 2 BPR cases we found on the Web The commercial KM tool capabilities noted earlier were not available to us at the time Thus we could not avoid this problem Furthermore even if these tools were available to us browsing a rough sample of retrieved BPR links reveals that some BPR narratives are short 1 2 printed pages while others bring up long reports or online books 1 2 pages Similarly some narratives describe experience reports while others tell of lessons learned or prescribe best practices O98 Subsequently there is a great deal of variability and uncertainty with respect to the kind of results one gets through a surface level analysis of BPR case texts found on the Web depending on what cases are used for analysis and categorization and what order you choose to analyze them As such our team based knowledge acquisition effort could produce models of BPR knowledge that might be inconsistent logically incomplete or inadequately traceable when integrated We therefore needed ways and means to enable the construction of a consistent logically complete and traceable knowledge web for BPR The second problem we faced was how to develop knowledge representation and operationalization methods that utilize Web resources and technologies This problem is related to the preceding one In particular our graduate student collaborators were organized into six teams who could openly discuss and share their emerging knowledge as to what knowledge they were finding in the Web based BPR cases Cases came from all over the world though for practical reasons we limited our efforts to those available in English and accessible without fee All students were trained for what to examine in each case and each team was assigned to develop a specific BPR case taxonomy Cases were examined for information that could minimally conform to the ontology of objects attributes relations and constraints specified in the process meta model MS96 In simple terms students had to identify the organizational roles of the participants identified in the case the information processing tasks these participants performed within the business process the resources used or consumed in the tasks any off line or on line tools or applications any Internet Web elements and what changes occurred to any of these as a result of the process redesign described in the case Beyond this the students then had to identify one or more process redesign heuristics that could characterize each selected case Open discussion and collaboration was again encouraged in identifying the process redesign heuristics including a lecture discussion of one case study that identifies ten process redesign heuristics SN97 Overall more than 3 process redesign heuristics were identified and classified Next six taxonomies were identified for grouping and organizing access to the BPR cases discovered on the Web These taxonomies classified and indexed the cases according to Generic type of industry process financial manufacturing research and development marketing etc As is problems with existing process off line information processing workflow delays lack of information sharing etc To be solutions sought for redesigned process automate off line information processing tasks streamline workflow use email and databases to share information etc Use of intranet extranet or Web based process redesign solutions build intranet portal for Human Resources information use HTML form EDI translators for procurement from Internet based suppliers etc BPR how to guidelines or lessons learned explicit methods or steps for how to understand and model the as is process identify process redesign alternatives involve process users in selecting redesign alternatives etc BPR heuristics parallelize sequence of mutually exclusive tasks unfold multi stage review approval loops disintermediate or flatten internal management structures require and verify all data before processing etc In turn each of these taxonomies could then be represented as hierarchically nested indices of Web links to the corresponding cases in ways familiar to Web users Typically each taxonomy indexes 6 12 cases out of the total set of more than 2 This means that some cases could appear in one taxonomy but not another while other cases might appear in more than one and still others might not appear in any of these taxonomies if they were judged to not possess the minimal information needed for characterization and modeling The last problem we addressed was how to facilitate the continuing evolution and improvement of a knowledge web for BPR Proposing technically elegant solutions to the preceding two problems that would be costly take a long time or produce inconsistent results would defeat our purpose Similarly we cannot expect that a no cost effort requiring little time will produce dramatic results at least not in a research study Nonetheless we wanted to find a means that could incorporate and integrate knowledge acquired from new BPR cases that might later be posted on the Web in a streamlined evolutionary and incremental manner With these problems at hand we now describe our approach to solving them using a formal knowledge system Approach A key factor in achieving the goals describe in the previous section is the ability to handle knowledge in the more formal end of the spectrum shown in Figure 1 Representing knowledge about a business process using an informal process model graphic diagram or in textual form is not always adequate If we want to automate reasoning with the model to perform some task we need to use a richer and more structured representation There are a variety of languages and formalisms where we can represent a business process model For example we find business process models expressed using a markup language like XML or even HTML This provides enough structure to build simple applications that can browse summarize or search the model contents However for complex tasks like evaluating diagnosing or simulating a process model however we may need to perform truly automated reasoning and for that we need a formal knowledge representation language SM97 One of the reasons why formal knowledge representations are not used more frequently is that developing a formalized knowledge base is generally not a casual undertaking Instead it is one where circumstances motivate the use or reliance on formal models of domain knowledge and problem solving expertise In a domain such as Air Campaign Planning VRMS99 the inherently complexity of the task at hand together with the multiplicity of system applications users employ underscores the need to invest in a developing a formalized knowledge based Similarly in a domain like BPR there is widespread opportunity to practice and reuse known concepts techniques and tools to realize economic gain organizational transformation or reinvention This justifies the investment in developing and engineering a formal knowledge base for BPR interlinked to supporting cases and navigational indices on the Web In particular this points to the need to develop knowledge bases that can be reused easily Thus our approach consisted of developing a generic reusable knowledge base or ontology VRMS99 of business processes and then using it for creating specific knowledge bases of processes in a given industry or company In turn the reusable part of these some of these knowledge bases can be transformed into reusable ontologies in a layered approach Once we have the knowledge of business processes formalized in a knowledge representation system we can use the reasoning mechanisms provided by that system to develop applications that analyze a specific process model In order to test these ideas we used the ontology of business processes to build a tool to diagnose business process models The tool reasons with a given process model using a classification mechanisms and lists the problems found Its knowledge base contains a description of a taxonomy of types of problems in business process models We then tested this tool by applying it to model cost accounting business processes in a large utility company in California Tools for handling formal knowledge In developing knowledge bases and ontologies for the domain of BPR we used two tools First in order to represent BPR knowledge formally and reason with it we selected the Loom knowledge representation system MB95 Loom is a language and environment for constructing ontologies and intelligent applications VRMS99 It has been distributed to more than 8 universities and corporations and is being used in numerous DARPA sponsored projects in planning software engineering and intelligent integration of information Declarative knowledge in Loom consists of definitions of concept relations and instances A deductive engine called a classifier utilizes forward chaining semantic unification and object oriented truth maintenance technologies in order to compile the declarative knowledge into a network designed to efficiently support on line deductive query processing By using Loom to re implement the process meta model ontology we can construct formal models of business processes classification taxonomies and process redesign heuristics In turn we can then analyze query browse and identify relevant redesign alternatives for processes that have been modeled in Loom and linked over the Web Finally we can take advantage of Loom s deductive classifier so that as new BPR cases are acquired taxonomically classified and formally modeled our knowledge web can evolve with automated support Second in order to support the visualization of the knowledge bases constructed we used Ontosaurus ONTO a Web browser interface to the Loom system Ontosaurus is a client server tool in which a server written in CommonLisp with Loom and one or more knowledge bases loaded replies to queries and produces Web pages describing several aspects of the knowledge base It is also able to provide simple facilities for producing general queries and editing the contents of knowledge bases Figure 2 shows a typical browser window accessing Ontosaurus The display consists of three window panels Toolbar top Reference left side and Content right side The Toolbar panel consists of buttons to perform various operations such as select domain theory display theory save updates etc The Reference and Content panels are designed to display contents of a selected ontology Links in both panels display their contents in the Content window This facilitates exploring various links associated with a word or concept in the Reference window without the need to continuously go back and forth The bookmark window holds user selected links for Web pages to Ontosaurus pages and is managed by the buttons in the bottom of the bookmark window Figure 2 An Ontosaurus browser interface display Formally Representing Business Process Models and Process Redesign We now describe how we built a knowledge based system to represent and diagnose models of BPR The system is based on an ontology of business processes expressed in Loom Loom provides a semantic network knowledge representation framework based on description logics In Loom it is possible to define concepts that have roles or slots to specify its attributes A key feature of description logic representations is that the semantics of the representation language are very precisely specified This precise specification makes it possible for the classifier to determine whether one concept subsumes another based solely on the formal definitions of the two concepts The classifier is an important tool for evolving ontologies because it can be used to automatically organize a set of Loom concepts into a classification hierarchy or taxonomy based solely on their definitions This capability is particularly important as the ontology becomes large since the classifier will find subsumption relations that people might overlook as well as modeling errors that could make the knowledge base inconsistent Modeling Business Process Knowledge in Loom The specific process ontology or meta model we employed is centered on the notion of resource MS96 There are three basic types of resource process agent and simple resource which is a placeholder for all non agent resources that are not processes In order to facilitate communication with a user community that is accustomed to object oriented modeling we chose a modeling style in Loom that is closest to object orientation For example information about concepts is stored into roles similarly to classes and properties in an object oriented language The definition of the concept process appears in the left frame of Figure 3 We also made use of Loom s superior expressiveness For instance in Loom roles slots or properties are first class objects called relations Relations are defined separately and may contain not only type restrictions but also cardinality restrictions It also allows the definition of inverse relations such as in the example below where we define the relation intelligence collective role own resource Note also how we define the domain of the relation as a logical composition over some existing concepts types defrelation intelligence collective role own resource domain or intelligent agent process role collective agent range resource inverse resource belong to intelligence collective role To create a business process model entails creating a number of instances of the available concepts This is done in a manner similar to how objects that are instances of classes are created in object oriented languages Instances are created in Loom with the command tellm For example the following is the definition of a business process in a company where we applied the system to support process modeling analysis and redesign The definition specifies for example that the instance Produce work order has the attribute process require resource filled by the value work order preparation info which is itself an instance defined elsewhere tellm about Produce work order process process require resource work order preparation info process require resource work order data process provide resource work order process assigned to agent role business unit process require tool resource accounting computer system Modeling Types of Problems in a Business Process Model We used the taxonomy of problems in business processes models described above and elsewhere MS97 There are three types of problems that arise when modeling business processes First consistency problems refer to conflicts in the specification of several properties of a given process For example a typical consistency problem is to have a process with the same name as one of its outputs something that occurs surprisingly often in practice perhaps because the output is often the most visible characteristic of a process Second completeness problems cover incomplete specifications of the process For instance a typical completeness problem occurs when we specify a process with no inputs a miracle which can produce outputs with no inputs or no outputs a black hole where inputs disappear without generating any output Third traceability problems are caused by incorrect specification of the origin of the model itself its author and responsible Subsequently a process model that is consistent complete and traceable can be said to be internally correct One of the main reasons that we selected Loom as a representation language was its capability to represent easily and naturally abstract patterns of data that are the very definition of the problems we discussed above This capability is very handy to produce simple and readable representations of the types of problems with process models For example we can define a black hole in plain English as a process with no outputs This can be easily described in Loom as a process that provides exactly zero resources defconcept black hole is and process exactly process provide resource Figure 3 Ontosaurus display with Process concept definition loaded in the Reference window and a process redesign instance in the Contents window Many of the simple types of problems can be specified similarly A more interesting example is the definition of a process with the same name as one of its inputs Here we use logical expressions to describe conditions that an instance must satisfy in order for a concept to apply For instance below we show the specification of process and input with same name in the ontology The definition reads roughly that a process has input with the same name if and only if it is a process and it satisfies the condition that it requires itself defconcept process and input with same name is and process satisfies x process require resource x x The diagnosis tool Using the representations discussed above we built a system that diagnoses business processes The system operation is very straightforward The user describes a process model through Ontosaurus for processing by Loom as discussed above Then the system diagnoses the model provided One of the advantages of using Loom is that once we define an instance Loom immediately and automatically applies its reasoning engine the classifier to find out what concepts apply to that instance This offers a big advantage since there is no need to specify an algorithm for the diagnosis process the diagnosis occurs automatically as we define the model In addition the classifier performs truth maintenance if we redefine a process to correct a problem found by the system the classifier will immediately retract the assertion that the problem applies to that process Thus we do not need to keep track of the state of the diagnosis as the model changes instead the classifier handles the processing activities In order to provide a more direct interface to the diagnosis system we extended the Ontosaurus browser to display two new types of pages The first displays a description of process in a less Loom specific way e g for reporting purposes The second displays a list of all problems found in the current process model we input The extension was rather simple all we had to do was to design two additional output page templates and code the appropriate responses in the Loom server Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the Web page constructed by the server to describe the problems found in a model of a cost accounting process see below Testing the system We tested the system with a team assigned the task of redesigning the cost accounting processes of a utility company in California the name is omitted for confidentiality reasons The team had to acquire knowledge of the processes formally represent them and then eventually propose a to be solution that redesigned the processes The team interviewed process experts met with several employees examined documentation organizational charts etc The first value added provided by the KWMS was caused even before using the process diagnosis module By modeling the process in more or less formal terms i e using the process ontology embedded in the system the team was able to construct a more coherent model The KWMS helped the BPR team to be more precise and detailed than when they just used graphic diagrams and narrative text The second value added was provided by the diagnosis system since it helped catch errors early in the modeling process An example appears in Figure 4 In fact in the beginning the diagnosis module helped the team to learn how to construct the formal representation of the process model by providing feedback in what they should not do The number of errors generated by entering new processes steadily diminished with time showing the value of the system Discussion and Conclusions Our investigation demonstrated and prototyped approach to integrate knowledge management and business process reengineering with global resources accessible over the Web A knowledge web for BPR was acquired represented and operationalized by a team of collaborating graduate students We prototyped a Loom based knowledge web management system that supported the development use and incremental evolution of a knowledge web grounded in informal BPR case studies found on the Web This KWMS provides the capability to browse query model and diagnose a knowledge base of formal models of business processes multiple BPR classification taxonomies and process redesign heuristics Subsequently our team learned and practiced Web based knowledge management and BPR through participation and contribution However the KWMS at this stage lacks the capability to automatically redesign formalized business processes Automated redesign is a problem solving task that represents the next stage of development of our prototype However there are BPR situations where automated redesign may not be a suitable goal or outcome This is in organizational settings where people seek empowerment and involvement in designing and controlling their process structures and workflow In settings such as these the ability to access search query select and evaluate possible process redesign alternatives through a KWMS may be more desirable cf SN97 Thus the ultimate purpose of the KWMS we describe may be in supporting and empowering BPR participants rather than in automating BPR Figure 4 Generated report from Loom diagnosis of a process redesign case Overall the problems identified and addressed by this research are generic and independent of specific business process types Nonetheless we believe the approach we pursued is highly reusable and can for the most part be replicated in other settings Subsequently we find there are classes of research and practical problems whose solution may span a knowledge dimension that covers informal semi structured and formal representations of knowledge that must then be interlinked across the Web and formal knowledge systems This work thus represents one such solution References

This is possible in that these mechanisms employ term clustering\nor classification techniques based on statistical, information theoretic\nand linguistic analyses of a text database. By their very nature, text\nanalysis techniques such as these provide their value through a shallow\nsyntactic or surface-level processing of a document or text base.

Further, most of the KM tools\nconcentrate on the left half. In this study, we seek to broaden this scope\nby organizing, interrelating and managing business process redesign knowledge\nthat <i>spans</i> this dimension.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>The research in this article is focused on the domain\nof \"business process redesign\", or BPR. BPR involves the transformation\nof enterprise processes, information infrastructure, work situations and\nsurrounding resources into more optimal configurations. BPR is in many\nways a precursor of KM in enterprises from historical, organizational and\ntechnological perspectives [DP98]. Though much has been written about BPR\nand hundreds of BPR case studies have appeared (in print and on the Web),\nthere has been little effort at developing an underlying formalization\nas to what constitutes BPR. For example, an initial effort classify and\nretrieve relevant cases has been demonstrated using case-based reasoning\ntechniques on a set of eight cases represented as attribute-value tuples\n[KS96]. Other notable efforts employ knowledge-based capabilities to help\nredesign specific business processes [N97, ST96]. Nonetheless, there has\nbeen progress in developing concepts, techniques and tools for formalizing\nand engineering enterprise <i>processes</i> for business and software development\nfrom a knowledge-based perspective [MS96, N97, SM97]. In addition, this\nprogress with enterprise process technology has also led to the integration\nand use of Web technologies [SN97]. Finally, we have an existing process\nmodeling ontology available to us [MS96]. We thus use our existing enterprise\nprocess ontology and domain expertise as the starting point for representing\nknowledge about BPR. Subsequently, we choose to acquire and represent knowledge\nof BPR from case studies found on the Web.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>By combining formalized knowledge representations for\nenterprise processes with Web technologies, we make a move towards the\ndevelopment of intelligent support tools for managing BPR knowledge over\nthe Web. Our goal in this study is to acquire and represent a knowledge\nweb for BPR that is operationalized and managed by a prototype knowledge\nweb management system (KWMS). The knowledge web is the target knowledge\nbase we wish to acquire and represent; the environment for operationalizing\nand managing this knowledge works as a KWMS.</font>\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=+1>Problems</font></font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>In order to realize our research goal, we must address\nthree problems. The first problem is <i>how to acquire global knowledge\nfor how to redesign complex business processes</i>. Our solution entails\na number of activities. We start by using popular search engines and index\nservers available on the Web. Using keywords such as \"business process\nredesign\", \"process reengineering\" and \"case studies\", we quickly locate\nhundreds of links to possible sources of BPR knowledge cases. Of course,\ngiven the variability in the precision and recall of these information\nretrieval services, a substantial effort is needed to browse, filter and\nselect BPR narratives that can subsequently be coded and classified as\nuseful cases. As a result, we employed a group of 30 graduate students\nparticipating in a graduate seminar on BPR to browse, filter, select, code\nand classify the 200+ BPR cases we found on the Web. The commercial KM\ntool capabilities noted earlier were not available to us at the time. Thus\nwe could not avoid this problem. Furthermore, even if these tools were\navailable to us, browsing a rough sample of retrieved BPR links reveals\nthat some BPR narratives are short (1-2 printed pages), while others bring\nup long reports or online books (100-200+ pages). Similarly, some narratives\ndescribe <i>experience reports</i>, while others tell of <i>lessons learned</i>\nor prescribe <i>best practices</i> [O98]. Subsequently, there is a great\ndeal of variability and uncertainty with respect to the kind of results\none gets through a surface level analysis of BPR case texts found on the\nWeb, depending on what cases are used for analysis and categorization,\nand what order you choose to analyze them. As such, our team-based knowledge\nacquisition effort could produce models of BPR knowledge that might be\ninconsistent, logically incomplete, or inadequately traceable when integrated.\nWe therefore needed ways and means to enable the construction of a consistent,\nlogically complete and traceable knowledge web for BPR.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>The second problem we faced was <i>how to develop knowledge\nrepresentation and operationalization methods that utilize Web resources\nand technologies</i>. This problem is related to the preceding one. In\nparticular, our graduate student collaborators were organized into six\nteams who could openly discuss and share their emerging knowledge as to\nwhat knowledge they were finding in the Web-based BPR cases. Cases came\nfrom all over the world, though for practical reasons, we limited our efforts\nto those available in English and accessible without fee. All students\nwere trained for what to examine in each case, and each team was assigned\nto develop a specific BPR case taxonomy. Cases were examined for information\nthat could minimally conform to the ontology of objects, attributes, relations\nand constraints specified in the <i>process meta-model</i> [MS96]. In simple\nterms, students had to identify the organizational roles of the participants\nidentified in the case, the information processing tasks these participants\nperformed within the business process, the resources used or consumed in\nthe tasks, any off-line or on-line tools or applications, any Internet/Web\nelements, and what changes occurred to any of these as a result of the\nprocess redesign described in the case. Beyond this, the students then\nhad to identify one or more process redesign heuristics that could characterize\neach selected case. Open discussion and collaboration was again encouraged\nin identifying the process redesign heuristics, including a lecture discussion\nof one case study that identifies ten process redesign heuristics [SN97].\nOverall, more than 30 process redesign heuristics were identified and classified.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>Next, six taxonomies were identified for grouping and\norganizing access to the BPR cases discovered on the Web. These taxonomies\nclassified and indexed the cases according to:</font>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<font size=-1><i>Generic type of industry process: </i>financial, manufacturing,\nresearch and development, marketing, etc.</font></li>\n\n<li>\n<font size=-1><i>As-is \"problems\" with existing process: </i>off-line information\nprocessing, workflow delays, lack of information sharing, etc.</font></li>\n\n<li>\n<font size=-1><i>To-be \"solutions\" sought for redesigned process: </i>automate\noff-line information processing tasks, streamline workflow, use email and\ndatabases to share information, etc.</font></li>\n\n<li>\n<font size=-1><i>Use of intranet, extranet or Web-based process redesign\nsolutions: </i>build intranet portal for Human Resources information, use\nHTML form-EDI translators for procurement from Internet-based suppliers,\netc.</font></li>\n\n<li>\n<font size=-1><i>BPR how-to guidelines or lessons learned: </i>explicit\nmethods or steps for how to understand and model the as-is process, identify\nprocess redesign alternatives, involve process users in selecting redesign\nalternatives, etc.</font></li>\n\n<li>\n<font size=-1><i>BPR heuristics: </i>parallelize sequence of mutually exclusive\ntasks, unfold multi-stage review/approval loops, disintermediate or flatten\ninternal management structures, require and verify all data before processing,\netc.</font></li>\n</ul>\n<font size=-1>In turn, each of these taxonomies could then be represented\nas hierarchically nested indices of Web links to the corresponding cases\nin ways familiar to Web users. Typically, each taxonomy indexes 60-120\ncases out of the total set of more than 200. This means that some cases\ncould appear in one taxonomy but not another, while other cases might appear\nin more than one, and still others might not appear in any of these taxonomies\nif they were judged to not possess the minimal information needed for characterization\nand modeling.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>The last problem we addressed was <i>how to facilitate\nthe continuing evolution and improvement of a knowledge web for BPR</i>.\nProposing technically elegant solutions to the preceding two problems that\nwould be costly, take a long time, or produce inconsistent results would\ndefeat our purpose. Similarly, we cannot expect that a no-cost effort requiring\nlittle time will produce dramatic results, at least not in a research study.\nNonetheless, we wanted to find a means that could incorporate and integrate\nknowledge acquired from new BPR cases that might later be posted on the\nWeb in a streamlined, evolutionary and incremental manner.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>With these problems at hand, we now describe our approach\nto solving them using a formal knowledge system.</font>\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=+1>Approach</font></font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>A key factor in achieving the goals describe in the previous\nsection is the ability to handle knowledge in the more formal end of the\nspectrum shown in Figure 1. Representing knowledge about a business process\nusing an informal process model, graphic diagram, or in textual form is\nnot always adequate. If we want to automate reasoning with the model to\nperform some task, we need to use a richer and more structured representation.\nThere are a variety of languages and formalisms where we can represent\na business process model. For example, we find business process models\nexpressed using a markup language like XML or even HTML. This provides\nenough structure to build simple applications that can browse, summarize\nor search the model contents. However, for complex tasks like evaluating,\ndiagnosing or simulating a process model, however, we may need to perform\ntruly automated reasoning, and for that we need a formal knowledge representation\nlanguage [SM97].</font>\n<p><font size=-1>One of the reasons why formal knowledge representations\nare not used more frequently is that developing a formalized knowledge\nbase is generally not a casual undertaking. Instead, it is one where circumstances\nmotivate the use or reliance on formal models of domain knowledge and problem\nsolving expertise. In a domain such as Air Campaign Planning [VRMS99],\nthe inherently complexity of the task at hand together with the multiplicity\nof system applications users employ underscores the need to invest in a\ndeveloping a formalized knowledge based. Similarly, in a domain like BPR,\nthere is widespread opportunity to practice and reuse known concepts, techniques\nand tools to realize economic gain, organizational transformation or reinvention.\nThis justifies the investment in developing and engineering a formal knowledge\nbase for BPR interlinked to supporting cases and navigational indices on\nthe Web.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>In particular, this points to the need to develop knowledge\nbases that can be reused easily. Thus, our approach consisted of developing\na generic, reusable knowledge base or <i>ontology</i> [VRMS99] of business\nprocesses and then using it for creating specific knowledge bases of processes\nin a given industry or company. In turn, the reusable part of these some\nof these knowledge bases can be transformed into reusable ontologies, in\na layered approach.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>Once we have the knowledge of business processes formalized\nin a knowledge representation system we can use the reasoning mechanisms\nprovided by that system to develop applications that analyze a specific\nprocess model. In order to test these ideas, we used the ontology of business\nprocesses to build a tool to diagnose business process models. The tool\nreasons with a given process model using a classification mechanisms and\nlists the problems found. Its knowledge base contains a description of\na taxonomy of types of problems in business process models. We then tested\nthis tool by applying it to model cost accounting business processes in\na large utility company in California.</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\">Tools for handling formal knowledge</font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>In developing knowledge bases and ontologies for the domain\nof BPR we used two tools. First, in order to represent BPR knowledge formally\nand reason with it, we selected the Loom knowledge representation system\n[MB95]. Loom is a language and environment for constructing ontologies\nand intelligent applications [VRMS99]. It has been distributed to more\nthan 80 universities and corporations, and is being used in numerous DARPA-sponsored\nprojects in planning, software engineering and intelligent integration\nof information. Declarative knowledge in Loom consists of <i>definitions</i>\nof concept, relations and instances. A deductive engine called a <i>classifier</i>\nutilizes forward-chaining, semantic unification and object-oriented truth\nmaintenance technologies in order to compile the declarative knowledge\ninto a network designed to efficiently support on-line deductive query\nprocessing. By using Loom to re-implement the process meta-model ontology,\nwe can construct formal models of business processes, classification taxonomies\nand process redesign heuristics. In turn, we can then analyze, query, browse\nand identify relevant redesign alternatives for processes that have been\nmodeled in Loom and linked over the Web. Finally, we can take advantage\nof Loom's deductive classifier so that as new BPR cases are acquired, taxonomically\nclassified and formally modeled, our knowledge web can evolve with automated\nsupport.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>Second, in order to support the visualization of the knowledge\nbases constructed, we used Ontosaurus [ONTO], a Web browser interface to\nthe Loom system. Ontosaurus is a client-server tool in which a server (written\nin CommonLisp) with Loom and one or more knowledge bases loaded replies\nto queries and produces Web pages describing several aspects of the knowledge\nbase. It is also able to provide simple facilities for producing general\nqueries and editing the contents of knowledge bases. Figure 2 shows a typical\nbrowser window accessing Ontosaurus. The display consists of three window\npanels; Toolbar (top), Reference (left side) and Content (right side).\nThe Toolbar panel consists of buttons to perform various operations such\nas <i>select domain theory</i>, <i>display theory, save updates</i>, etc.\nThe Reference and Content panels are designed to display contents of a\nselected ontology. Links in both panels display their contents in the Content\nwindow. This facilitates exploring various links associated with a word\nor concept in the Reference window without the need to continuously go\nback and forth. The bookmark window holds user-selected links for Web pages\nto Ontosaurus pages, and is managed by the buttons in the bottom of the\nbookmark window.</font>\n<center>\n<p><img SRC=\"Ontosaurus.gif\" height=768 width=1024>\n<p><b><font size=-1>Figure 2</font>. </b><font size=-1>An Ontosaurus browser\ninterface display.</font></center>\n\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\">Formally Representing Business Process Models\nand Process Redesign</font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>We now describe how we built a knowledge-based system\nto represent and diagnose models of BPR. The system is based on an ontology\nof business processes expressed in Loom. Loom provides a semantic network\nknowledge representation framework based on description logics. In Loom\nit is possible to define <i>concepts</i> that have roles or slots to specify\nits attributes. A key feature of description logic representations is that\nthe semantics of the representation language are very precisely specified.\nThis precise specification makes it possible for the classifier to determine\nwhether one concept <i>subsumes</i> another based solely on the formal\ndefinitions of the two concepts. The classifier is an important tool for\nevolving ontologies because it can be used to automatically organize a\nset of Loom concepts into a classification hierarchy or taxonomy based\nsolely on their definitions. This capability is particularly important\nas the ontology becomes large, since the classifier will find subsumption\nrelations that people might overlook, as well as modeling errors that could\nmake the knowledge base inconsistent.</font>\n<p><i><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=-1>Modeling Business Process Knowledge\nin Loom</font></font></i>\n<p><font size=-1>The specific process ontology (or meta-model) we employed\nis centered on the notion of resource [MS96]. There are three basic types\nof resource: process, agent and simple resource (which is a placeholder\nfor all non-agent resources that are not processes). In order to facilitate\ncommunication with a user community that is accustomed to object-oriented\nmodeling, we chose a modeling style in Loom that is closest to object-orientation.\nFor example, information about concepts is stored into roles, similarly\nto classes and properties in an object-oriented language. The definition\nof the concept </font><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>process</font></font><font size=-1>\nappears in the left frame of Figure 3.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>We also made use of Loom?s superior expressiveness. For\ninstance, in Loom, roles, slots or properties are first-class objects called\n<i>relations.</i>\nRelations are defined separately, and may contain not only type restrictions\nbut also cardinality restrictions. It also allows the definition of inverse\nrelations, such as in the example below, where we define the relation </font><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>intelligence-collective-role-own-resource</font></font><font size=-1>.\nNote also how we define the domain of the relation as a logical composition\nover some existing concepts (types).</font>\n<p><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(defrelation intelligence-collective-role-own-resource</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>:domain (:or intelligent-agent\nprocess-role collective-agent)</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>:range resource</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>:inverse resource-belong-to-intelligence-collective-role)</font></font>\n<p><font size=-1>To create a business process model entails creating a\nnumber of instances of the available concepts. This is done in a manner\nsimilar to how objects that are instances of classes are created in object-oriented\nlanguages. Instances are created in Loom with the command tellm. For example,\nthe following is the definition of a business process in a company where\nwe applied the system to support process modeling, analysis and redesign.\nThe definition specifies, for example, that the instance </font><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>Produce-work-order</font></font><font size=-1>\nhas the attribute </font><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>process-require-resource</font></font><font size=-1>\nfilled by the value </font><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>work-order-preparation-info</font></font><font size=-1>\n(which is itself an instance defined elsewhere).</font>\n<p><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(tellm (:about Produce-work-order</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>process</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(process-require-resource work-order-preparation-info)</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(process-require-resource work-order-data)</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(process-provide-resource work-order)</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(process-assigned-to-agent-role\nbusiness-unit)</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(process-require-tool-resource\naccounting-computer-system)))</font></font>\n<p><i><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=-1>Modeling Types of Problems in a\nBusiness Process Model</font></font></i>\n<p><font size=-1>We used the taxonomy of problems in business processes\nmodels described above and elsewhere [MS97]. There are three types of problems\nthat arise when modeling business processes. First, consistency problems\nrefer to conflicts in the specification of several properties of a given\nprocess. For example, a typical consistency problem is to have a process\nwith the same name as one of its outputs (something that occurs surprisingly\noften in practice, perhaps because the output is often the most visible\ncharacteristic of a process). Second, completeness problems cover incomplete\nspecifications of the process. For instance, a typical completeness problem\noccurs when we specify a process with no inputs (a \"miracle\", which can\nproduce outputs with no inputs) or no outputs (a \"black hole\", where inputs\ndisappear without generating any output). Third, traceability problems\nare caused by incorrect specification of the origin of the model itself:\nits author and responsible. Subsequently, a process model that is consistent,\ncomplete and traceable can be said to be internally correct.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>One of the main reasons that we selected Loom as a representation\nlanguage was its capability to represent easily and naturally abstract\npatterns of data that are the very definition of the problems we discussed\nabove. This capability is very handy to produce simple and readable representations\nof the types of problems with process models. For example, we can define\na </font><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>black-hole</font></font><font size=-1>\nin plain English as \"a process with no outputs\". This can be easily described\nin Loom as a process that provides exactly zero resources:</font>\n<p><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(defconcept black-hole</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>:is (:and process</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(:exactly 0 process-provide-resource)))</font></font>\n<center>\n<p><img SRC=\"bpr-kbs1.GIF\" height=997 width=1236>\n<p><b><font size=-1>Figure 3</font>. </b><font size=-1>Ontosaurus display\nwith</font><b> </b><font size=-1><font face=\"Courier New\">Process </font>concept\ndefinition loaded in the Reference window and a process redesign instance\nin the Contents window</font></center>\n\n<p><font size=-1>Many of the simple types of problems can be specified\nsimilarly. A more interesting example is the definition of a process with\nthe same name as one of its inputs. Here we use logical expressions to\ndescribe conditions that an instance must satisfy in order for a concept\nto apply. For instance, below we show the specification of <font face=\"Courier New\">process-and-input-with-same-name</font>\nin the ontology. The definition reads (roughly) that a process has input\nwith the same name if and only if it is a process and it satisfies the\ncondition that it requires itself.</font>\n<p><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>(defconcept process-and-input-with-same-name</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>&nbsp;:is (:and process</font></font>\n<br><font face=\"Courier New\"><font size=-2>&nbsp;(:satisfies ?x (process-require-resource\n?x ?x))))</font></font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\">The diagnosis tool</font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>Using the representations discussed above, we built a\nsystem that diagnoses business processes. The system operation is very\nstraightforward. The user describes a process model through Ontosaurus\nfor processing by Loom as discussed above. Then the system diagnoses the\nmodel provided. One of the advantages of using Loom is that once we define\nan instance, Loom immediately (and automatically) applies its reasoning\nengine (the classifier) to find out what concepts apply to that instance.\nThis offers a big advantage, since there is no need to specify an algorithm\nfor the diagnosis process: the diagnosis occurs automatically as we define\nthe model. In addition, the classifier performs truth-maintenance: if we\nredefine a process to correct a problem found by the system, the classifier\nwill immediately retract the assertion that the problem applies to that\nprocess. Thus, we do not need to keep track of the state of the diagnosis\nas the model changes; instead, the classifier handles the processing activities.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>In order to provide a more direct interface to the diagnosis\nsystem, we extended the Ontosaurus browser to display two new types of\npages. The first displays a description of process in a less Loom-specific\nway (e.g., for reporting purposes). The second displays a list of all problems\nfound in the current process model we input.. The extension was rather\nsimple: all we had to do was to design two additional output page templates\nand code the appropriate responses in the Loom server. Figure 4 shows a\nscreenshot of the Web page constructed by the server to describe the problems\nfound in a model of a cost accounting process (see below).</font>\n<p><i><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=-1>Testing the system</font></font></i>\n<p><font size=-1>We tested the system with a team assigned the task of\nredesigning the cost accounting processes of a utility company in California\n(the name is omitted for confidentiality reasons). The team had to acquire\nknowledge of the processes, formally represent them, and then eventually\npropose a to-be solution that redesigned the processes. The team interviewed\nprocess experts, met with several employees, examined documentation, organizational\ncharts, etc. The first value-added provided by the KWMS was caused even\nbefore using the process diagnosis module. By modeling the process in more\nor less formal terms (i.e. using the process ontology embedded in the system),\nthe team was able to construct a more coherent model. The KWMS helped the\nBPR team to be more precise and detailed than when they just used graphic\ndiagrams and narrative text. The second value-added was provided by the\ndiagnosis system, since it helped catch errors early in the modeling process.\nAn example appears in Figure 4. In fact, in the beginning the diagnosis\nmodule helped the team to learn how to construct the formal representation\nof the process model by providing feedback in what they should not do.\nThe number of errors generated by entering new processes steadily diminished\nwith time, showing the value of the system.</font>\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=+1>Discussion and Conclusions</font></font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>Our investigation demonstrated and prototyped approach\nto integrate knowledge management and business process reengineering with\nglobal resources accessible over the Web. A knowledge web for BPR was acquired,\nrepresented and operationalized by a team of collaborating graduate students.\nWe prototyped a Loom-based knowledge web management system that supported\nthe development, use and incremental evolution of a knowledge web grounded\nin informal BPR case studies found on the Web. This KWMS provides the capability\nto browse, query, model, and diagnose a knowledge base of formal models\nof business processes, multiple BPR classification taxonomies, and process\nredesign heuristics. Subsequently, our team learned and practiced Web-based\nknowledge management and BPR through participation and contribution. However,\nthe KWMS at this stage lacks the capability to automatically redesign formalized\nbusiness processes.</font>\n<p><font size=-1>Automated redesign is a problem-solving task that represents\nthe next stage of development of our prototype. However, there are BPR\nsituations where automated redesign may not be a suitable goal or outcome.\nThis is in organizational settings where people seek empowerment and involvement\nin designing and controlling their process structures and workflow. In\nsettings such as these, the ability to access, search/query, select and\nevaluate possible process redesign alternatives through a KWMS may be more\ndesirable [cf. SN97]. Thus the ultimate purpose of the KWMS we describe\nmay be in <i>supporting</i> <i>and empowering</i> BPR participants rather\nthan in automating BPR.</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><img SRC=\"bpr-kbs2.GIF\" height=977 width=861>\n<br><b><font size=-1>Figure 4</font>. </b><font size=-1>Generated report\nfrom Loom diagnosis of a process redesign case</font></center>\n\n<p><font size=-1>Overall, the problems identified and addressed by this\nresearch are generic and independent of specific business process types.\nNonetheless, we believe the approach we pursued is highly reusable and\ncan for the most part be replicated in other settings. Subsequently, we\nfind there are classes of research and practical problems whose solution\nmay span a knowledge dimension that covers informal, semi-structured, and\nformal representations of knowledge that must then be interlinked across\nthe Web and formal knowledge systems. This work thus represents one such\nsolution.</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=+1>References</font></font></b>\n<p><font size=-1>[DP98] T.H. Davenport and L.
