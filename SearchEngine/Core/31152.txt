These include the ability to\nmake anchors on portions of documents, connect such anchors to links, and\nto traverse links.  The Jimage client application provides such capabilities\nin the form of an application that displays gif and jpeg images.\n</p>\n\n<p> Jimage will function as an application that displays images even if\nyou don't have Chimera on your system.  In that case, you will not have the\nability to use the hypermedia functions Chimera provides.\n</p>\n\n<H3>Things to have in place for Jimage</H3>\n\n<p> Jimage is written in Java and it requires that you have the following\nin place on your system.  \n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> A Java Interpretor compatible with JDK 1.1.5\n\t\n    <li> Swing 0.7 (This is used to display Jimage and \n\tshould be in your CLASSPATH variable.)\n\n</ul>\n\n<p> (See \n<A HREF=\"preparing_system.html\">Preparing your System for Chimera\n</A> for an example of setting swing for your system.)\n</p>\n\n<H3>Downloading Jimage</H3>\n\n<p>\nYou may download Jimage from the following site:\n<br> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/chimera/software/index.html\">\nChimera 2.0 Download page </A>\n<br> \nJimage should be listed on the page.\n</p>\n\n<p>Place Jimage anywhere you wish on your system.  A good spot is \na directory which you use to hold your Java programs.\n</p>\n\n<H3>Preparing to run Jimage on your system</H3>\n\n<p> Once you have downloaded Jimage, you need to add it to the \nyour CLASSPATH.  CLASSPATH is the environment variable used by the \nJava interpretor to look for Java byte-code.\n</p>\n\n<p> To see how to add Jimage to the CLASSPATH follow the appropriate link\nbelow:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><A HREF=\"jimage_classpath_setup_unix.html\">\n        Setting CLASSPATH in Unix to include jimage\n        </A>&nbsp;</li>\n\n    <li><A HREF=\"jimage_classpath_setup_nt.html\">\n        Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include jimage\n        </A>&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p> You now have the Jimage application downloaded and properly set to \nbe run.\n</p>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 31152.0}
