them with his in laws in Hungary Bayla was the sister of the first wife Since my grandfather was the 1 th of his 12 children and was born in1867 the older ones would have been born in the 184 s and

Schonfeld Hi I found your page fascinating especially since my mother has her grandfather s name as Zvi Elimelech and one of her sister s said his name was Hersh Shula and my grandparents had a first baby boy who died shortly after birth whose name was Hersh Melech I don t know hi wives maiden names nor his first wife s name just my great grandmother Bayla Some of your dates dont fit if I am estimating my grandfather s birth in 1867 since he was the 1 th if Zvi s children his father had to have been born at least 35 when he was born so Zvi would have had to be born no later than 183 Wish I could help more I don t know any of my grandfathers siblings names but have several of his niece s and nephew s names and will try that route Marge Schechner I would say most definitely To tell you where you fit can you provide either some of the siblings names or verify that Bayla s maiden name was Kallush Did he have a sister Sara Please see my website at www langsam com or the specific page

that I know of is my grandfather Moses Moshe For some reason no one in the family knows the names of any of his siblings just that Zvi was from Hungary and born somewhere in the 182 3 range Zvi had died by 1896 since the first child to my grandparents was a boy named Hersh Melech who died shortly after birth and was born in 1896 I know the names of a few of his siblings children who were my grandfather s age One of his siblings sons obviously a brother was Abe Schonfeld who accompanied my grandmother here in 1912 June or so to New York and two sisters Esther Weisman and Fannie Goldberg

the 8th of 1 children from the second marriage and he was born in 1867 so if R Hersh Mylech Spira died in 1841 then my great grandfather would have been born then and fathered 1 children by the time he was 26 in 1867 when my grandfather was born Possible but not likely unless a lot of them died in infancy and another was produced in less than a year I wish I knew Marge You wrote Hi Thanks for

the current e mail address for Nathan Rosenshein and will forward this message to him Dear Nathan I finally have definitive knowledge as to how the Schonfeld and Kallush families are related Rabbi Meshullam Dov Kallush Dayan religious court judge of Munkacs was the father in law of Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Schonfeld son of Moshe Schonfeld and Sara Spira the daughter of the Bnei Yissaschar In fact after Rabbi Z E Schonfeld s zivug rishon first wife was niftar died her sibling became his sivug sheni second wife I have known this for several years What is new is that Rabbi Meshullam Dov Kallush also had a son Elimelech Kallush who had a son Shalom Kallush d 192 who married a daughter of Rabbi Z E Schonfeld Shalom and his wife nee Schonfeld had a son BenZion and a daughter Chaya Breine who married Rabbi Shlomo Eliezer Weisel he was Rabbi in a town in Maramoresh Other Kallush offspring are not named here since I don t have that information Hopefully this will be helpful to you and others
