She\nwalks away fast.<p>\n\nI like her, she tells the truth and she doesn't want\nanything free. <p>\n\nA girl in shorts and halter top, barefoot, pretty,\nstands by the door for a while--they all start\nwrong that way, standing a while without talking\nto get up their nerve -- then tells me she's been\nwaiting for weeks, looking forward, her friends are\ninside, a bummer, could she just sneak in? I give\nher my smile of apology, gee, I feel bad, I'm just\nhere taking tickets, after all.... She knows how\nI feel, her friends, looking forward, a bummer,\noh well. She says have a good day.<p>\n\nI like her too, she's nice. If I like you I won't let\nyou in without a ticket.<p>\n\nThere's never a problem with your friends, they\nalways have tickets, and they've got them out\nbefore you have to ask.<p>\n\nA guy who worked here, inside, but he quit or\nthey fired him, he walks up and starts to small\ntalk, nice day, good crowd? I give him short\nanswers, I know what he wants. He never looks\nstraight at me once, just questions, how's Bob, did\nAnnette have her baby yet. He doesn't want to\nhave to ask, he wants me to say come on in Ed?\non me? for old times' sake? We were never friends,\nI'm going to make him say it. And it takes him so\nlong, he can think of so many questions. Finally\nhe asks, he's broke, things are tough, I say go on\nin, but no smile, no friendship, just get out of\nhere. Ten minutes of thank you till I say again go\non in.<p>\n\nJust make me despise you, you can get me to let\nyou in free. I do it to hurt you.<p>\n\nI don't know why I've stayed at this job for so\nlong. It's not the right kind of job for someone\nlike me.<p>\n\nI stay because sometimes somebody just walks\nthrough. They have no ticket and I don't ask,\nthey don't need one. Not for the obvious reasons:\nit's not just beautiful women or old men with\ncanes. Just people who don't need tickets, who\nwalk right through. It's like they hypnotize me,\nbut they don't. It's who they are. I don't ask for\na ticket, I say hi.<p>\n\nThe thing I wonder about, the thing that amazes\nme, is how do they know they don't need a ticket.\nYou need tickets here. People cheat and sneak,\nbut it's not the same thing. What does it feel\nlike, knowing you don't need a ticket? They never\nact like movie stars or the president; more like\nthey don't know anyone needs a ticket. But they\ndo know that. They don't act embarrassed, either.<p>\n\nThat's what you wait for, taking tickets. Sometimes \nit's months, even years. Then someone walks\nthrough, and it makes you feel good, deep inside,\nway down. all the way.<p>\n\n\n\n\n", "id": 32900.0}
