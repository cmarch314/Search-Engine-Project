Based on the domain rules encoded, the situation based controller came up with relevant recommendations. The recommendation for each microblogger was decided (see Fig. 4) based on a combination of the micro-level event (e.g. Sore-throat) and macro situation parameter (e.g. \u2018Level 3=Epidemic\u2019, or \u2018Level 1=Low activity\u2019).\r\n<img src=\"../images/SwineFlu.png\" width = 500px />\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 10453.0}
