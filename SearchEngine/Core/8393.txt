The scheme which \r\nis based on the mini\ufffdbucket idea for approximating \r\nvariable elimination algorithms, is parameterized,\r\nallowing a flexible control between \r\nefficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, since the \r\nscheme outputs a bound on its accuracy, it \r\nallows an anytime scheme that can terminate \r\nonce a desired level of accuracy is achieved. \r\nThe presented scheme should be viewed as a \r\nguiding framework for approximation that can \r\nbe improved in a variety of ways.</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r84.ps\"><b>PostScript</b></a> |\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r84.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8393.0}
