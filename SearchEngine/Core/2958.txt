If you are unsure what a Matlab function does, check the reference manual (at the command line, type \"help\" and then the command name).\n\n    <p> <b> What to hand in. </b> \n    <ol>\n\t<p><li> Include a script for questions 3 and 4 (titled <tt> hw1_q3.m</tt> and <tt>hw1_q4.m</tt>) that the grader can run to generate all the given figures. Most of the following can be done in a matlab script, but feel free to call other scripts, functions (but include them in the homework zip file). When instructed to write a function, your script must call that function.\n\t<p><li> Make sure each question is answered in your project writeup, including either a figure, plot, and/or an example snippet of the interactive commands and output used to compute the question.\n    </ol>\n    \n    <hr>\n\n    <ol>\n      <p><li> Read over the provided the Matlab <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dramanan/teaching/cs216_fall09/MatlabTutorialCode.html\">tutorial</a>.\n\t<p> Open an interactive session in Matlab and test the commands by typing them at the\nprompt. (Skip this step if you are already familiar with Matlab.)\n\t<p><li> Describe (in words where appropriate) the result of each of the following Matlab commands. Use the help command as needed, but try to determine the output without entering the commands into Matlab. For this part of the assignment, do not submit a screenshot of the result of typing these command.\n\t<ol type=a>\n\t    <p><li>  >> x = randperm(5);\n\t    <p><li> >> a = [1:10];\n\t    <br> >> b = a([1:3:end]);\n\t    <p><li> >> f = [1501:2000];\n\t    <br> >> g = find(f > 1850);\n\t    <br> >> h = f(g);\n\t    <p><li> >> x = 22.*ones(1,10);\n\t    <br> >> y = sum(x);\n\t    <p><li> >> a = [1:1000];\n\t    <br> >> b = a([end:-1:1]);\n\t</ol>\n\t<p><li> Given a 100 x 100 uint8 matrix A representing a grayscale image (hint - use \"imread\"), write a few lines of code to do each of the following. Try to avoid using loops. Select any image you want, or use one extracted from one of the videos on the project data page.

Set any negative values to 0.\n\t    <p><li> Use rand to write a function that returns the roll of a six-sided die.\n\t    <p><li> Let <I>y</I> be the vector: y = [1:6]. Use the reshape command to form a new matrix <I>z</I>\n\t    whose first column is [1, 2, 3]', and whose second column is [4, 5, 6]'.\n\t    <p><li> Use the <I>min</I> and <I>find</I> functions to set <I>x</I> to the single minimum value that occurs\n\t    in <I>A</I>, and set <I>r</I> to the row it occurs in and <I>c</I> to the column it occurs in.\n\t    <p><li> Let <I>v</I> be the vector: v = [1 8 8 2 1 3 9 8].
