The approach involves extracting heuristics from a \r\nparameterized approximation scheme called Mini-Bucket elimination that allows controlled trade-off between \r\ncomputation and accuracy. The heuristics are used to guide Branch-and-Bound and Best-First search, \r\nwhose performance are compared on a number of constraint problems. Our results demonstrate that both search\r\nschemes exploit the heuristics effectively, permitting controlled trade-off between preprocessing \r\n(for heuristic generation) and search. These algorithms are compared with a state of the art complete \r\nalgorithm as well as with the stochastic local search anytime approach, demonstrating superiority in\r\nsome problem cases.</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r87.ps\"><b>PostScript</b></a> |\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r87.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8669.0}
