in 1926 and followed him to Pgh My father Alex Eckstein is one of those children I can provide you with alot of information about this part of the family and quite a bit about the Rosner side as well I also have a second cousin in the NYC area Brooklyn I believe who has been working extensively on the Eckstein Rosner genealogy I just heard from him recently which sparked my interest in doing some

Alemelech ben Yosef Shlomo After Lya and Josef Sholomo were divorced he married Harriet Freidman and they had nine children The Rosner name comes into play because Lya married a man named Morton

everyone Recently I have been in touch with a second cousin of ours Avery Horowitz who my parents met many years ago in Brooklyn Over the years he has been compiling an Eckstein genealogy and he recently got in touch with me He would like to update his records about our part of the family births marriages deaths etc Any information you could provide or corroborate would be greatly appreciated He would like the Hebrew and English names of your parents of you and your siblings of your children and their children if there are any Your birthplace and that of your parents and children grandchildren would also be great Marriage and death dates are also important Anything you can provide would be terrific After hearing from Avery I decided to look on the internet to see what else I could find out about Ecksteins Lots of non Jewish Ecksteins but I did find an extensive genealogy to the Langsam Miller Spria Eckstein genealogy It seems as though we are related to these families I have been in touch with Moishe Miller who is compiling this genealogy He has done a wonderful job as has Avery Here is a link to Moishe s work http www ics uci edu dan genealogy Miller langsam htm You may be wondering how we are related to Avery Horowitz I hope I get this right His mother is Helen Applebaum Horowitz and she is the daughter of Goldie Eckstein Applebaum Goldie was one of the nine children of our great grandfather Yosef Shlomo Eckstein and Chava Rosner his second wife according to Avery Remember that Yosef Shlomo and our great grandmother Lya or Lia Sternberger or Steinberger had one child Herman our grandfather and then they divorced Therefore Avery and all of us share the same great great grandfather A side note my Dad believes that his grandfather s second wife was someone named Friedman because he remembers having cousins with the last name of Rosner According to Avery this is because Lya the first wife married a cousin of Chava s named Morton Rosner Just to make it really interesting two of Lya and Morton Rosner s daughters married two Applebaum brothers this is in addition to the fact that Avery s grandmother Goldie also married a man named Applebaum I am not sure if these Applebaums are related If this seems confusing believe me it is I understand that Uncle Albert was also compiling information I am hoping that we can all share this information Additional information about grandfather Herman his birthplace date marriage date s etc would be great Also any information that anyone has on our great great grandfather Yosef Shlomo would be very important including birth death dates and places his occupation If any of you have pictures of any of our ancestors it would be great to create a digital archive I would be happy to scan any photographs and post them to everyone Note I have a copy of the passenger manifest sheet from our parents voyage on the SSRoosevelt in 1926 If anyone wants a copy of this I would be happy to duplicate it and send it on Carol your copy will be in the mail shortly Hope you don t mind that I have contacted you this way and I know this is alot of work on your part Love and best wishes to all of you

I\r\nthink I have seen Family Tree Maker at Walmart.  Which product is better in\r\nyour view?\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  I talked to my Dad about this recently, and he thinks there might be a\r\nmistake with respect to Yosef Shlomo's wive(s).  You both have his wife\r\nas\"Chava Rosner.\"  According to my Dad, his grandfather's first wife was Lya\r\n(sp??) Sternberger and they had one child, who was my grandfather Herman\r\nEckstein.  His hebrew name was not Hersh Melech, but Zvi Alemelech ben Yosef\r\nShlomo.  After Lya and Josef Sholomo were divorced, he married Harriet\r\nFreidman and they had nine children.  The Rosner name comes into play\r\nbecause Lya married a man named Morton Rosner and had 4 or 5 children whose\r\nnames I have and also those of their children, but not right in front of me\r\nnow.  I will get this info to you.  Now this is according to my father, who\r\nsaid he got the information from my Uncle Albert, who was the keeper of the\r\nfamily genealogy and was the oldest.

Over the years\r\nhe has been compiling an Eckstein genealogy and he recently got in touch\r\nwith me.  He would like to update his records about our part of the\r\nfamily--births, marriages, deaths etc.  Any information you could provide\r\nor corroborate would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nHe would like the Hebrew and English names of your parents, of you and\r\nyour siblings, of your children, and their children if there are any.\r\nYour birthplace and that of your parents and children, grandchildren,\r\nwould also be great.  Marriage and death dates are also important.\r\nAnything you can provide would be terrific.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing from Avery, I decided to look on the internet to see what\r\nelse I could find out about Ecksteins.  Lots of non-Jewish Ecksteins, but\r\nI &lt;did> find an extensive genealogy to the Langsam, Miller, Spria,\r\nEckstein genealogy.  It seems as though we are related to these families.\r\nI have been in touch with Moishe Miller, who is compiling this genealogy.\r\nHe has done a wonderful job, as has Avery.  Here is a link to Moishe's\r\nwork:  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam.htm\r\n \r\nYou may be wondering how we are related to Avery Horowitz.  I hope I get\r\nthis right!  His mother is Helen Applebaum Horowitz, and she is the\r\ndaughter of Goldie Eckstein Applebaum.  Goldie was one of the nine\r\nchildren of our great-grandfather Yosef Shlomo Eckstein and Chava Rosner\r\n(his second wife, according to Avery). Remember that Yosef Shlomo and our\r\ngreat-grandmother Lya or Lia Sternberger or Steinberger had one child,\r\nHerman, our grandfather, and then they divorced.  Therefore Avery and all\r\nof us share the same great-great grandfather.  (A side note:  my Dad\r\nbelieves that his grandfather's second wife was someone named Friedman,\r\nbecause he remembers having cousins with the last name of Rosner.\r\nAccording to Avery, this is because Lya, the first wife, married a cousin\r\nof Chava's named Morton Rosner.  Just to make it  &lt;really> interesting,\r\ntwo of Lya and Morton Rosner's daughters married two Applebaum brothers;\r\nthis is in addition to the fact that Avery's grandmother Goldie also\r\nmarried a man named Applebaum.  I am not sure if &lt;these> Applebaums are\r\nrelated)  If this seems confusing, believe me, it is!\r\n\r\nI understand that Uncle Albert was also compiling information.  I am\r\nhoping that we can all share this information.  Additional information\r\nabout grandfather Herman (his birthplace, date, marriage date(s), etc)\r\nwould be great.  Also, any information that anyone has on our great-great\r\ngrandfather Yosef Shlomo would be very important including birth/death\r\ndates and places, his occupation.\r\n \r\nIf any of you have pictures of any of our ancestors it would be great to\r\ncreate a digital archive.  I would be happy to scan any photographs and\r\npost them to everyone.\r\n \r\nNote:  I have a copy of the passenger manifest sheet from our parents voyage\r\non the SSRoosevelt in 1926.  If anyone wants a copy of this, I would be\r\nhappy to duplicate it and send it on.  (Carol, your copy will be in the mail\r\nshortly.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you don't mind that I have contacted you this way, and I know this is\r\nalot of work on your part.  Love and best wishes to all of you.\r\n \r\nLove-\r\n\r\nCousin Barbara \r\n \r\n61 Pine Hill Drive\r\nAlfred, NY 14802\r\n \r\ngreilbj@alfredstate.edu\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Tue, 4 Sep 2001 12:00:10 -0400 (EDT) \r\nFrom: Avery M Horowitz &lt;averymh@touro.edu> \r\nTo: \"Greil, Barbara\" &lt;GreilBJ@alfredstate.edu> \r\ncc: \"'moishe'\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Re: FW: Please add us to Your family geneaology mailing list \r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, 3 Sep 2001, Greil, Barbara wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n> What do you folks make of this??\r\n>  \r\n> B\r\n> -----Original Message-----\r\n> From: Applbaum [mailto:apples@barak-online.net]\r\n> Sent: Sunday, September 02, 2001 12:19 PM\r\n> To: GreilBJ@alfredstate.edu\r\n> Subject: Please add us to Your family geneaology mailing list\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I am Yosef Shlomo Applbaum...\r\n>    :-)\r\n>     Joseph S.
