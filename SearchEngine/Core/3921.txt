Textbooks frequently omit it, many database systems\ndon't implement it, so we desire data structures that don't require\nit. We therefore discuss variants of multiway search trees and\nbalanced binary trees that do not perform deletion rebalancing, yet\ntheir search time remains logarithmic in the number of insertions. We\nalso discuss a strong claim made by the authors that \"[w]ith the\naddition of periodic rebuilding, the performance of these structures\nis theoretically superior to that of many if not all classic balanced\ntree structures.\"  We lay out the facts and let you decide if this is\na veritable \"timber!\" for our beloved search trees. \n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3921.0}
