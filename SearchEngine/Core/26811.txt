They have \nbeen around long enough that those in business management are sure to have \nsome familiarity, even if only name recognition. On the other hand, the most \nimportant of the implementing processes, the Thinking Processes, are little \ndiscussed and even less well known. While Goldratt mentions one or another of \nthe five processes in his latter books, there is nothing in print available \nfrom the Goldratt Institute. If one wishes to learn how to work the Thinking \nProcesses, they must be trained at the Goldratt Institute; with one \nexception, a text written by H. William Dettmer and published by ASQC Press \ntitled \"Goldratt's Theory of Constraints; A Systems Approach to Continuous \nImprovement.\"\n\n<p>\n\nAs a student and personal friend of Dettmer, I have advocated his book as one \nof the best written texts in process improvement. \nHe has reduced and simplified Goldratt's methodology to something everyone \ncan understand and apply. This Socratic cause/effect methodology is a \npowerful and compelling approach to problem solving in any area where some \ntype of constraint is controlling \nreality. Starting with a Current Reality Tree (CRT) to determine the several \nroot causes and prevalent core problem constraining the system, one gains \nknowledge of what needs to be changed. Using the Conflict Resolution Diagram \n(CRD or Evaporating Cloud) to unearth underlying assumptions leading to \nconflict, solutions and alternatives may be discovered and developed into a \nFuture Reality Tree (FRT). This resolves the issue of what to change to. \nFinally, the question of how to implement the change is handled by the \nprocesses of constructing a Prerequisite Tree (PRT) and a Transition Tree \n(TT). In this presentation we describe each of the five \nelements and the Categories of Legitimate Reservation, those test elements \nwhich look into the logic of the cause/effect relationships.\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\nBy education, Dr. Novick is a Materials Scientist with degrees from the \nUniversity of Arizona, MIT and Columbia. \nBy vocation he is a technical manager with an MBA from Fordham and 40 years \nexperience performing and managing fundamental and applied R&D, operations, \nsales and marketing. By preference he is a problem solver and facilitator of \ncontinuous process improvement; a profession he now pursues as a technical \nadvisor on process improvement for The Boeing Company.\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html\">\nUCI Maps and Directions</a> to meeting are available.\n<p>\n\n\nNext Meeting: <p>\n\n<blockquote>\nDate: Friday, June 26, 1998<br>\nTopic: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/flyers/98/june98.html\">Software Architecuture</a><br>\nSpeakers: Richard N.
