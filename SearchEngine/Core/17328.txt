But Eve\nhas intercepted <i>C</i> and she doesn't even know Bob's public key. \nExplain how\nEve can alter the ciphertext <i>C</i> to change it into <i>C'</i> so that\nif she sends <i>C'</i> to Bob (with Eve pretending to\nbe Alice), then, after Bob has decrypted <i>C'</i>, he will get a\nplaintext message that is twice the value of <i>M</i>.\n<li> \nSuppose Eve has captured two ciphertexts <i>C=(a,b)</i> and\n<i>D=(c,d)</i> for\ntwo separate message <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>, respectively, that were \nsent to Bob under the ElGamal encryption scheme (using the same public key\nfor Bob).
