{"text": " This assignment is due at the beginning of your discussion section on Wednesday November 19 Summary This assignment will give you practice with some basic probability concepts Feel free to discuss these problems with others but be sure you know how to solve them and similar problems on your own a Every day you download some investment information from a web site whose server s load varies on different days of the week On Monday through Thursday the download takes you 15 minutes On Friday it takes you 25 minutes On Saturday and Sunday it takes you 1 minutes What is your overall expected download time i e imagine you don t know what day it is b A standard slot machine has three wheels each with 2 symbols distributed as shown below When the arm is pulled each of the 2 symbols on each wheel is equally likely to come up Symbol Wheel 1 Wheel 2 Wheel 3 bar 1 3 1 bell 1 3 3 plum 5 1 5 orange 3 6 7 cherry 7 7 lemon 3 4 b 1 What is P a bar comes up on Wheel 1 b 2 What is P a bar comes up on Wheel 2 b 3 What combination of symbols on the three wheels should yield the highest payoff assuming payoffs decrease with higher probabilities There are two equivalent answers to this b 4 What is P a lemon comes up on all three wheels b 5 What is P not getting a plum on Wheel 1 Complementary probabilities may help here c In the California Lottery game SuperLotto a player would pay 1 to pick six numbers between 1 and 51 for the next draw We re describing the original SuperLotto game not the current SuperLotto Plus with a separate Mega number the probabilities for SuperLotto Plus are a little more complicated Every Wednesday and Saturday the Lottery draws six numbers If the player s six numbers match the Lottery s six numbers the player wins the multi million dollar jackpot or splits it with any other players who also picked the same six winning numbers If nobody matches the six winning numbers the jackpot rolls over to the next draw that is the jackpot amount for the draw with no winners is added to the jackpot for the next draw If many draws go by with no winners the jackpot can get very large it has been over 1 Which of the following statements are supported by the principles of probability Give a yes or no answer to each with a few words of explanation c 1 If you pay 2 for two different sets of numbers you are twice as likely to win as if you paid 1 c 2 If you pay 1 for 1 different sets of numbers you are 1 times as likely to win as if you paid 1 c 3 If you buy one ticket for every drawing for ten years your chances of winning are roughly a thousand times greater than if you buy just one ticket c 4 If you decide to play the same six numbers in every draw from now on you should check the winning numbers in the past to be sure your numbers haven t come up already c 5 If you play for a few months and not a single number you choose is included in the winning numbers you are a little more likely to win the next draw because you re due c 6 If you play for a few months and two or three of your numbers are included in the winning numbers of each draw you are a little more likely to win the next draw because you re on a roll c 7 Since 5 of the ticket revenues goes to prizes in general the expected value of a 1 ticket is 5 cents c 8 The expected value of your 1 ticket will will be higher if you only play when the jackpot is over 1 c 9 Your probability of winning is greater if you pick numbers between 1 and 31 because many people pick birthdates as their numbers c 1 Your expected value is greater if you pick numbers greater than 31 c 11 extra credit we won t ask you to do something like this on an exam Calculate the probability of winning the SuperLotto jackpot c 12 extra credit Calculate the expected value of playing a 1 SuperLotto ticket The hard part about this isn t the calculation it s finding the payout amounts over the last year They re not available at the California Lottery web site www calottery com and we don t know if they re available anywhere so this is an opportunity for you to do some creative web searching d from Patterns of Problem Solving by Moshe F Rubinstein In one brief sentence how is information related to probability If you know that 5 people out of every 1 have cancer and if we have a perfectly accurate test that predicts whether a person has cancer which of the following gives us more information The test indicates that a person has cancer The test indicates that a person does not have cancer What to turn in A word processing document that includes the answers to all the questions in each part
