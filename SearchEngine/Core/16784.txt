These practices are\nbecoming increasingly important as organizations try to figure out \nhow to implement changes to their business practices that have been \nfostered by the increased use of COTS, outsourcing and open systems. \nThis SBIR's aim was to make product line, architecture and software \nreuse concepts a natural part of the processes organizations like \nyours use to develop systems and software according to the Systems, \nSoftware and Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Models \n(SE-CMM, SW-CMM and SA-CMM). The talk will start by providing background\non the SBIR effort, its motivation and what it has accomplished to date.\nIt will then summarize its Phase I and Phase II findings, conclusions \nand recommendations. Finally, the talk will describe the best processes/\npractices that RCI has developed based upon these results and inputs \nfrom a market survey and six process assessments. The talk will conclude\nwith a stimulating question and answer session.\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography: </strong>\nDonald J. Reifer is one of the leading figures in the field of software\nengineering and management with more than 30 years of progressive \nexperience in both government and industry. While Director of the DoD \nSoftware Initiatives Office, Mr. Reifer served as Chief of the DoD \nSoftware Reuse Initiative and Ada Joint Program Office under an \nintergovernmental Personnel Act assignment with the Defense Information\nSystems Agency.
