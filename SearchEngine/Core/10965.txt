Ray Steiner steiner math bgsu edu wrote Greetings all I am teaching a course of mathematics for elementary teachers and a problem in the text recently asked about some of the possible number of distinct points in which 4 5 6 7 8 distinct lines could meet I extended it a bit farther and we found the following results For 4 distinct lines we could get 1 3 4 5 or 6 possible distinct points For 5 we could get all integers from 4 to 1 For 6 we could get all integers from 5 to 15 This led to the following questions We know that n distinct lines can meet in at most n n 1 2 distinct points For which n can we get all the integers from n 1 to n n 1 2 as possible numbers of distinct points of intersection How would one attack this problem for general n This pattern does not continue forever for large n there is no configuration of n lines which gives exactly n 1 intersection points I think that this is so for all n 1 but I have no proof of this stronger statement Here is a sketch of the proof the full proof would be rather long Suppose we have a configuration of n lines giving n 1 intersection points What is the largest number of lines in the configuration which are concurrent or parallel These two cases will come up so often that it will be easier to move to the projective plane where there is no distinction between them Of course this has a cost instead of just counting intersection points we have to count the points and then see how many can be removed by arranging to have them lie on the line at infinity when converting back to the ordinary plane Note the restriction that the line at infinity cannot be one of the n lines of the configuration If all n lines are concurrent we only get 1 projective intersection point which may be a finite point or a point on the line at infinity giving or 1 ordinary intersection points If n 1 of them meet at one point but the n th doesn t then we get n 1 additional points from the n th line for a total of n this gives either n 1 or n finite points If the largest number of lines at a point is n 2 then the n 1 th line gives n 2 additional points of which one may be infinite and the n th line also meets the first n 2 in n 2 points of which one may be infinite and one may lie on the n 1 th line leaving at least n 4 new finite points Therefore there are at least n 3 n 4 2n 7 finite points which is too many Similarly if the largest number of lines at a point is n 3 then we get at least n 4 n 5 n 6 3n 15 finite intersection points Continuing this downward we see that as long as k is large enough that k 1 k 2 2 n 1 we will get too many finite intersection points if there are k lines meeting at a point So in the desired configuration the largest number of lines through a particular point is at most about sqrt 2n Next consider the case where two different points each have at least d lines passing through them One of these lines might pass through both points but this still leaves d 1 other lines at each point which produce d 1 2 intersection points Since at most one of the points on each of the first d 1 lines can be on the line at infinity we get at least d 1 d 2 finite intersection points Therefore in the desired configuration the point with the second largest number of lines through it has at most about sqrt n such lines If one considers three points which each have at least d lines through them then with a substantial amount of extra work one can show that there must be at least 3d 2 2 6d 3 finite intersection points This bound isn t quite sharp but the leading term is Therefore in the desired configuration every point with at most two exceptions lies on at most D lines where D is about sqrt 2n 3 Now the n lines give n n 1 2 pairs of lines and each such pair has an intersection point finite or infinite A point at which d lines meet takes care of d d 1 2 of these pairs There are only n 1 finite intersection points and these can take care of about n 1 D D 1 2 n 2 3 pairs The two possible exceptionally large intersection points would only yield about 5n 3 additional pairs How about points on the line at infinity The sum of the degrees number of lines meeting there of these points is at most n because each configuration line meets the line at infinity only once And we still have the bound D on the individual degrees So a simple optimization argument shows that the number of pairs with intersection point on the line at infinity is at most about n D D D 1 2 n 3 2 sqrt 6 Again the two exceptional points only change this bound by O n Therefore the total number of pairs of lines in the configuration is n 2 3 o n 2 since this is less than n n 1 2 for large n we have a contradiction This completes the sketch of proof that no configuration of n lines gives n 1 intersection points if n is large Actually the argument shows that no configuration of n lines gives between n 1 and cn intersection points where c tends to 3 2 for large n I conjecture that in fact for large n

What is the largest number of lines in the configuration\nwhich are concurrent or parallel?\n\nThese two cases will come up so often that it will be easier to move\nto the projective plane, where there is no distinction between them.\nOf course, this has a cost; instead of just counting intersection\npoints, we have to count the points and then see how many can\nbe removed by arranging to have them lie on the \"line at infinity\"\nwhen converting back to the ordinary plane.  Note the restriction\nthat the line at infinity cannot be one of the n lines of the\nconfiguration.\n\nIf all n lines are concurrent, we only get 1 projective\nintersection point, which may be a finite point or a point\non the line at infinity, giving 0 or 1 ordinary intersection points.\nIf n-1 of them meet at one point but the n'th doesn't, then we get\nn-1 additional points from the n'th line, for a total of n;\nthis gives either n-1 or n finite points.\n\nIf the largest number of lines at a point is n-2, then the\n(n-1)'th line gives n-2 additional points, of which one may be infinite,\nand the n'th line also meets the first n-2 in n-2 points, of which\none may be infinite and one may lie on the (n-1)'th line,\nleaving at least n-4 new finite points.  Therefore, there are at least\n(n-3)+(n-4) = 2n-7 finite points, which is too many.\n\nSimilarly, if the largest number of lines at a point is n-3,\nthen we get at least (n-4)+(n-5)+(n-6) = 3n-15 finite\nintersection points.  Continuing this downward, we see\nthat, as long as k is large enough that (k-1)(k-2)/2 &gt; n+1,\nwe will get too many finite intersection points if there\nare k lines meeting at a point.  So, in the desired configuration,\nthe largest number of lines through a particular point is\nat most about sqrt(2n).\n\nNext, consider the case where two different points each have\nat least d lines passing through them.  One of these lines\nmight pass through both points, but this still leaves d-1\nother lines at each point, which produce (d-1)^2 intersection\npoints.  Since at most one of the points on each of the\nfirst d-1 lines can be on the line at infinity, we get\nat least (d-1)(d-2) finite intersection points.  Therefore,\nin the desired configuration, the point with the second-largest\nnumber of lines through it has at most about sqrt(n) such lines.\n\nIf one considers three points which each have at least d lines\nthrough them, then, with a substantial amount of extra work,\none can show that there must be at least 3d^2/2 - 6d + 3\nfinite intersection points.  (This bound isn't quite sharp,\nbut the leading term is.)  Therefore, in the desired configuration,\nevery point with at most two exceptions lies on at most D lines,\nwhere D is about sqrt(2n/3).\n\nNow, the n lines give n(n-1)/2 pairs of lines, and each such\npair has an intersection point (finite or infinite).  A point\nat which d lines meet takes care of d(d-1)/2 of these pairs.\nThere are only n+1 finite intersection points, and these\ncan take care of about (n+1)D(D-1)/2 ~ n^2/3 pairs.\n(The two possible exceptionally large intersection points\nwould only yield about 5n/3 additional pairs.)\nHow about points on the line at infinity?  The sum of the degrees\n(number of lines meeting there) of these points is at\nmost n, because each configuration line meets the line\nat infinity only once.  And we still have the bound D on the\nindividual degrees.  So a simple optimization argument shows\nthat the number of pairs with intersection point on the\nline at infinity is at most about (n/D)D(D-1)/2 ~ n^(3/2)/sqrt(6).\n(Again the two exceptional points only change this bound\nby O(n).)  Therefore, the total number of pairs of lines\nin the configuration is n^2/3 + o(n^2); since this is\nless than n(n-1)/2 for large n, we have a contradiction.\nThis completes the sketch of proof that no configuration of\nn lines gives n+1 intersection points if n is large.\n\nActually, the argument shows that no configuration of n lines\ngives between n+1 and cn intersection points, where c tends\nto 3/2 for large n.  I conjecture that, in fact, for large n,\nthe first attainable number of intersection points\nafter 0, 1, n-1, and n is 2n-6.\n\nRandall Dougherty                       <A HREF=\"mailto:rld@math.ohio-state.edu\">rld@math.ohio-state.edu</A>\nDepartment of Mathematics,  Ohio State University,  Columbus, OH 43210  USA\n\"I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, that when looked at in the\nright way didn't become still more complicated.\"  Poul Anderson, \"Call Me Joe\"\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:kjellpe@math.uio.no\">kjellpe@math.uio.no</A> (Kjell Fredrik Rogstad Pettersen)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Question from the classroom: Geometry\n<B>Date:</B>           7 Jun 1996 07:17:43 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Oslo, Norway\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n[Ray Steiner]\n\n&gt; Of course,they can never meet!
