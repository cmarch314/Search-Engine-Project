have been successfully tested but others are not guaranteed to work Safari has known issues Reagents are generally 1 equivalent unless otherwise stated Syntheses are generated randomly by the system thus the solutions and steps suggested by the system may be non unique and non ideal Real Examination Caveats When generating reaction products the system will often omit inherent products in the results for the sake of brevity For example bromine radical addition should yield HBr as a by product and condensation reactions should yield H2O in the products but the system does not display these For real examination purposes you should include all of these to properly balance all reaction equations While practicing with the system selecting a reagent from a list is simple enough don t forget that in real exams you will most likely have to write out the complete reagent specifications from memory Walkthroughs Follow the links below to get a walkthrough of the most basic steps needed to

Complete a Non Random Assigned Synthesis Problem Review a Checklist of Problem Completion Requirements Complete a Mechanism Problem Help Sections FAQSynthesis ExplorerMechanism ExplorerReaction DrillsMolecule ViewProblem Record Q I m lost and do not even know how to get started What should I do A Check out the walkthroughs which include step by step instructions on how to get started with the most common tasks Q How do I login to the site A There is no formal login page for the site When you generate a synthesis problem from the Synthesis Explorer setup box just make sure you put in your user ID student ID number next to the User Class and ID label and the system will keep track of your records from there Q How do I submit a completed problem A There is no separate answer submission step If you logged in by putting in your user ID as described above just work on the synthesis problems and as soon as you enter the right answer the system will automatically congratulate you on your success and record your progress in the system You can verify this as it will state Your progress was recorded in the system Q How many attempts do I get to complete a problem Is there a time limit A All problems provide an unlimited number of tries with no penalty for guessing Problems do not have time limits other than due dates for assignments The system does not ever record anything you do wrong it only records when you get a problem correct So feel free to click around and experiment with different things You will never be penalized and this can be a great way to really learn and master the material Q How do I work the synthesis problems A Check out the walkthroughs which include step by step instructions on how to get started Q How do I check how many problems I ve already completed A Check out the walkthroughs which include step by step instructions on how to get started Most students will just be interested in the Progress Checklist to see how to complete their class requirements but detailed Problem Records are also available under the User Records section Q When I work on random synthesis problems what chapter should I work on A This is largely up to you You have the freedom and flexibility to select any chapters you feel you need to review the most Note that you can even select multiple chapters to generate more challenging and realistic problems Beware that depending on your class you may have additional requirements to complete at least X problems from each relevant chapter In that case you should try to cover the chapters listed on your Progress Checklist page Fulfilling these chapter requirements is easier than you probably think Completing assigned non random problems counts towards completing the chapter requirements You can select multiple chapters when generating a random problem Ctrl Click to select multiple and then completing just one such problem will count towards all included chapters Technically you could generate and solve just 2 problems that include every chapter and that will already fulfill the chapter requirements Q I ve been working on one of the assigned non random problems forever and still cannot figure it out Can I get some help A Some notes and tips on non random problems Don t feel bad if you re having trouble with the assigned problems they are specifically designed to be challenging Unlike random problems the assigned non random problems do not allow you to see the solution until you have solved them but you do still get to see the starting material hint and have unlimited tries with no penalty for guessing Check the Reaction Drills for the respective chapters or the Examples links for the reagents if you need to review the major types of reactions Go back to doing random problems from the same chapters to get more practice with the material until you can figure it out Hint Note that when you select a non random problem it includes a description like Smith 11 12 This refers to the last chapter section that you need to know to solve the problem and if you read that particular section it s probably a big hint towards how to solve the problem For most classes you can still get partial credit for the work you do even if you re unable to solve every assigned non random problem If you are still struggling try working with your classmates or instructors to figure out the solutions No computer system is ever going to replace having a good colleague to discuss with Q One of the synthesis frames reactant or reagent will not load preventing me from working on the problems What can I do A Several students have reported this issue however I have been unable to reproduce it to debug it If you can at least get the Product and Pathway frames loaded there are a couple links at the bottom of the Product frame which allow you to selectively reload the Reactants and Reagents frames Another alternative is to click on the Select a Reactant or Select a Reagent boxes from the Pathway frame to spawn popup windows from which you can select the reactants and reagents In this manner you never need to use the Reactant or Reagent frames at all Q My web browser freezes when I try to work on a problem What can I do A I have not been able to consistently reproduce such issues but here are some possible ideas One known cause of freezing is some kind of defect in the Skype instant messenger Internet Explorer add in Read the following web page for more details on how to get rid of it http share skype com sites devzone 2 7 6 the skype addin for internet e html Your best bet may be to just try it from a different computer I tried several computers in the science library and they all work Make sure all other windows and applications are closed and not interfering with the site Maybe avoid the Mechanism and magnify functions as I noticed FireFox has trouble loading the Java applet the first time Once it successfully loads once even if it s in Internet Explorer it does seem to work thereafter You should still be able to complete all synthesis problems without using any of these pages Check the FAQ about frames not loading which has some tips which may be related to what s happening Q The system shows the reactant reagent and product for all reactions so what am I actually supposed to do A First make sure you are not in the Reaction Drills section Those are only for your review and are not graded If you are in the actual Synthesis Explorer interface the system does predict the products for you but your job is to come up with the right sequence and combination of reactants and reagents to arrive at the Target Product in the top right frame Q I tried every reactant and reagent combination and none of them produced the target product What s wrong A These are supposed to be multi step synthesis problems so it s very likely that the problem cannot be solved by any single reactant reagent combination To complete a multi step synthesis problem after you complete one reaction you need to click on the product of the reaction to copy it as a reactant for a subsequent step The synthesis problem walkthrough illustrates an example of this Q I am an instructor from another institution and am interested in using the system in my class How can I go about this A Your students can already freely access the system to work on problems If they login with a unique identifier e g student ID number the system will also track the problem completion records As the instructor you may then review these records from the Problem Records page which includes additional instructions For more advanced instructor features such as assigning specific vs random problems with enforced due dates instructors should contact the developers to arrange an appropriate collaboration to configure the system accordingly Illustrated below are system screenshots with annotated descriptions of the purpose and function of different

different buttons and controls Random Mechanisms Non Random Assigned Mechanisms Overall Reaction The net overall reaction for which you are to determine the curved arrow mechanism diagram for Mechanism Arrow Sketcher Where you sketch your proposed curved arrow mechanism diagrams The sketcher should be pre loaded with the reactant side of the next mechanism step to be completed Refer to the Mechanism Sketching Tips for more info on how to use the sketcher In general the only functions you should need in this sketcher are the curved arrow buttons on the left circled This requires a Java applet signed by ChemAxon so make sure you have Java enabled in your browser and you accept the applet If you do not wish to use it you can still view the expected mechanism with the Solution button Mechanism Product Represents the expected product of electrons following the arrows from the mechanism arrow diagram on the left If presented as a sketcher that means you must modify the sketcher contents yourself to represent the expected product structure In general the only functions you should need in this sketcher are the bond drawing tool and the formal charge modifiers circled Product Generator Mechanism Calculator Once you have completed a mechanism step diagram with curved arrows click here to have the system actually apply the arrows to the molecule changing the configuration of bonds and electrons to generate the expected product of the diagram Support Buttons Resizable Sketcher s If your diagram is getting to large to fit in the sketchers click this checkbox to make popup resizable sketchers available Hint Click to load the next expected step s structures into the sketcher s From there just complete the step with curved arrows representing the electron flows between the reactant and product sides Solution Display the system s expected mechanism steps Submitted Mechanism Steps Shows all of the mechanism steps that you have submitted along with any notes on correctness Mechanism Sketching Tips The mechanism structure sketcher applet should look similar to the following This is a fully featured sketcher with many different functions including the creation of your own novel molecules For most cases however there are only few functions you will ever need Component Select and Erase Use the select tool to click and drag pieces of the diagram around This can help arrange the diagram pieces to facilitate arrow drawing The eraser can be used to remove unnecessary pieces Electron Flow Arrows Two different types of curved arrows can be used to sketch electron flows The first is a typical arrow for moving 2 electrons at a time while the second is a fishhook arrow for moving 1 electron at a time i e radical reactions Alternatively you may access the arrow functions from the Insert Electron Flow command menu Bond and Charge Modifiers The product structure sketcher will generally be pre loaded with the reactant structure for the next mechanism step To convert it into the expected product structure you will generally only need to use the bond tool to create new bonds or modify bond orders as well as the formal charge modifiers Arrow Drawing Tips Once you select an arrow type just click on the source of an arrow such as a bond or atom i e lone pair or free radical and then on the target sink for the arrow usually an atom or the space between two atoms where a new bond will form In the last case a dashed line should appear in the place where this incipient bond would form to help you precisely specify your diagram target Bonds as Electron Sources When the source of an electron flow is a bond special care must be taken when selecting the target sink for the flow Information on the polarity of the bond in particular which atom of the source bond the electrons will remain attached to must be specified This is specified by having the target of the electron flow be slightly between a target atom and at least one of the source atoms See the first two examples below for what may appear to be the same mechanism step but which differs in the result based on how the polarity of the source bond is specified as indicated by the blue half circles around the target atoms and the dashed line representing an incipient forming bond Free Radical Mechanisms The last example below illustrates a free radical mechanism step These commonly involve 3 fishhook arrows and often involve 2 such arrows meeting halfway between two atoms again indicated by the dashed line for a forming bond Illustrated below are system screenshots with annotated descriptions of the purpose and function of different buttons and controls Each row represents a distinct single step reaction with a component missing left for you to fill in the blank This is a good way to quickly quiz yourself to learn and review basic reactivity This is intended as a self test exercise so no progress report is recorded in the system for these Instead you should just try visualizing or writing down the answer to each problem on paper before revealing the answers Missing Component Reactant reagent or product of the single step reaction that is missing left for you to fill in the blank Control Buttons Show Answer Once you ve made a guess for missing component click on Show Answer to reveal the answer the system generated Mechanism Click to load up the reaction in the Mechanism Explorer to practice writing or directly view the arrow pushing mechanism for the reaction Challenge Click if you feel the predicted product for the reaction is in error This will bring up a form where you can submit what you believe the correct behavior should be for subsequent review Magnifying Glass Most molecules depicted throughout the system will include a magnifying
