Commentary This paper addresses an increasingly important problem how to search and manage personal collections of electronic information it addresses an important user centered problem this paper presents a practical user interface to make the system useful the paper includes large scale user oriented testing that demonstrates the efficacy of the system the evaluation uses both quantitative and qualitative data to make its case I think this paper is destined to be a classic because it may eventually define how people manage their files for a decade Moreover it is well written and can serve as a good model for developers doing system design and evaluation and for students learning about IR systems and evaluation Lecture 7 Notes Slides Lecture 8 Slides Lecture 9 Slides Week 42

their large size Recently several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow to store a web graph in memory in a limited space exploiting the inner redundancies of the web The WebGraph framework is a suite of codes algorithms and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs This papers presents the compression techniques used in WebGraph which are centred around referentiation and intervalisation which in turn are dual to each other WebGraph can compress the WebBase graph 118 Mnodes 1 Glinks in as little as 3 8 bits per link and its transposed

viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph This graph has about a billion nodes today several billion links and appears to grow exponentially with time There are many reasons mathematical sociological and commercial for studying the evolution of this graph We first review a set of algorithms that operate on the Web graph addressing problems from Web search automatic community discovery and classification We then recall a number of measurements and properties of the Web graph Noting that traditional random graph models do not explain these observations we propose a new family of

Decompositions and latent semantic indexing Indexing by latent semantic analysis by Deerwester Dumais et al Commentary IR as a field hasn t directly considered the issue of semantic knowledge representation The above paper is one of the few that does in the following way LSI is latent semantic analysis LSA applied to document retrieval LSA is actually a variant of a growing ensemble of cognitively motivated models referred to by the term semantic space LSA has an encouraging track record of compatibility with human information processing across a variety of information processing tasks LSA seems to capture the meaning of words in a way which accords with the representations we carry around in our heads Finally the above paper is often cited and interest in LSI seems to have increased markedly in recent years The above paper has also made an impact outside our field For example recent work on latent semantic kernels machine learning draws heavily on LSI Lecture 19 Slides

Kleinberg s work on hubs and authorities was a sem inal paper in showing how the information inherent in the underly ing network structure of the web could be exploited Kleinberg bases his model on the authorities for a topic and on hubs pages that link to a large number of thematically related authorities He observes that hubs are in equilibrium with and confer authority on the sites to which they link that is they have a mutually reinforcing relationship This work was significant in providing an algorithmic approach to quantifying the quality of web pages a key issue in the web environment where the massive size of the database informa tion redundancy and the uncertain quality and source of informa tion make retrieval difficult Lecture 22 Slides Lecture 23 Slides Lecture 24

definition Schamber Eisenberg Nilan Commentary This landmark paper initiated the wave of relevance research to come during the next 13 years It re examined the liter ature made during 3 years relying on the central works by Cuadra and Katter 1967 Rees and Schultz 1967 Cooper 1971 Wilson 1973 and Saracevic 1975 Essentially the conclusions were as follows 1 Relevance is a multidimensional cognitive concept Its meaning is largely dependent on searchers perceptions of infor mation and their own information need situations 2 Relevance assessments have multidimensional characteristics Relevance is a dynamic concept It can take many meanings such as topically ad equate usefulness or satisfaction But relevance is also dynamic as assessments of objects may change over time 3 Relevance is a complex but systematic and measurable phenomenon if ap proached conceptually and operationally from the searchers per spective Schamber et al 199 stressed the importance of context and situation They re introduced the concept of situational rel evance derived from Patrick Wilson s concept in 1973 originating from Cooper 1971 Context may come from the information ob jects or knowledge sources in systems but may also be part of the actual information seeking situation Two lines of relevance re search very fast followed the suggestions and conclusions in this paper One track pursued the theoretical developments of relevance types criteria and measurements thereby bridging over to labora tory IR evaluations The other line of research consists of empirical studies involving searchers in realistic settings Lecture 25 Guest Lecture on Sourcerer Source Code Search Engine Slides Lecture 26 Slides PDF QT Assignment 5 is due create a postings list Thanksgiving Holiday Week 1 December 1

The paper presents a highly efficient, scalable implementation of a ranking method which now delivers very high quality results to a billion people over billions of pages at about 6,000 queries per second. It also hints at the technology which Google users now take for granted: spam rejection, high speed query-based summaries, source clustering, and context(location)-sensitive search. IR and bibliometrics researchers had done it all (relevance, proximity, link analysis, efficiency, scalability, summarization, evaluation) before 1998 but this paper showed how to make it work on the web. For any non-IR engineer attempting to build a web-based retrieval system from scratch, this must be the first port of call.&quot;</li>\n              </ol>\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>        </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 13</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture13.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\">\n          <p><a href=\"Assignments/Assignment02.html\">Assignment 02</a> is due</p>\n        </div>        </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 14</p>\n      <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture14.html\">Slides</a>)</p></td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 15 </p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture15.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\">\n          <p><a href=\"Assignments/Assignment03.html\">Assignment 03</a> is due </p>\n        </div>        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"tableHighlight\">\n      <td valign=\"top\">Week 06</td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">November 3 </div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">4</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">5</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">6</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">7</div></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Scoring, Term Weighting and the Vector Space model</p>      </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 16</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture16.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\"><p>Quiz 03 </p></div>\n\t    <div class=\"style12\"></div></td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 17</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture17.html\">Slides</a>)</p>      </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 18</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture18.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\">\n          <p>Mid-Term Evaluation Due </p>\n        </div>        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"tableHighlight\">\n      <td valign=\"top\">Week 07</td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">10</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">11</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">12</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">13</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">14</div></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>Matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing</p>\n        <div class=\"indentRight\" style=\"text-align:left\">\n          <ol>\n            <li>Textbook <a href=\"materials.html\">Chapter 18 </a>: Matrix Decompositions and latent semantic indexing </li>\n            <li>&quot;<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.49.7546\">Indexing by latent semantic analysis</a>&quot; by (Deerwester, Dumais, et.al)\n                  <ol>\n                    <li>Commentary: &quot; IR, as a field, hasn&rsquo;t directly considered the issue of\n                      semantic knowledge representation. The above paper is one of the \n                      few that does in the following way. LSI is latent semantic analysis \n                      (LSA) applied to document retrieval. LSA is actually a variant of a \n                      growing ensemble of cognitively-motivated models referred to by \n                      the term &ldquo;semantic space&rdquo;. LSA has an encouraging track record of \n                      compatibility with human information processing across a variety \n                      of information processing tasks. LSA seems to capture the meaning\n                      of words in a way which accords with the representations we carry\n                      around in our heads. Finally, the above paper is often cited and\n                      interest in LSI seems to have increased markedly in recent years. \n                      The above paper has also made an impact outside our field. For\n                      example, recent work on latent semantic kernels (machine learning)\n                      draws heavily on LSI. &quot;</li>\n                  </ol>\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>      </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 19</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture19.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\">\n          <p><a href=\"Assignments/Assignment04.html\">Assignment 04</a> is due</p>\n        </div>        <p>&nbsp;</p>      </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\t\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 20</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture20.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>        </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 21</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture21.html\">Slides</a>)</p>\n        <p class=\"style12\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"tableHighlight\">\n      <td valign=\"top\">Week 08</td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">17</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">18</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">19</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">20</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">21</div></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Link analysis </p>\n        <div class=\"indentRight\" style=\"text-align:left\">\n          <ol>\n            <li>Textbook <a href=\"materials.html\">Chapter 21 </a>: Link Analysis</li>\n            <li>&quot;<a href=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/324133.324140\">Authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment</a>&quot; by (Kleinberg) </li>\n            <li>Commentary: &quot;Kleinberg&rsquo;s work on hubs and authorities was a sem-\n              inal paper in showing how the information inherent in the underly- \n              ing network structure of the web could be exploited.

It re-examined the liter- \n      ature made during 30 years, relying on the central works by Cuadra\n      and Katter (1967), Rees and Schultz (1967), Cooper (1971), Wilson \n      (1973), and Saracevic (1975). Essentially, the conclusions were as\n      follows. (1) Relevance is a multidimensional cognitive concept. Its \n      meaning is largely dependent on searchers&rsquo; perceptions of infor- \n      mation and their own information need situations. (2) Relevance\n      assessments have multidimensional characteristics; Relevance is a \n      dynamic concept. It can take many meanings, such as topically ad- \n      equate, usefulness, or satisfaction. But relevance is also dynamic \n      as assessments of objects may change over time. (3) Relevance\n      is a complex but systematic and measurable phenomenon &ndash; if ap- \n      proached conceptually and operationally from the searchers&rsquo; per- \n      spective. Schamber et al. [1990] stressed the importance of context\n      and situation. They re-introduced the concept of &ldquo;situational&rdquo; rel-\n      evance derived from Patrick Wilson&rsquo;s concept in 1973, originating \n      from Cooper (1971). Context may come from the information ob-\n      jects or knowledge sources in systems, but may also be part of the \n      actual information-seeking situation. Two lines of relevance re-\n      search very fast followed the suggestions and conclusions in this\n      paper. One track pursued the theoretical developments of relevance \n      types, criteria and measurements, thereby bridging over to labora-\n      tory IR evaluations. The other line of research consists of empirical\n      studies involving searchers in realistic settings.&quot;</li>\n  </ol>\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 25</p>\n        <p>Guest Lecture on <a href=\"http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/search/index.jsp\">Sourcerer</a> Source Code Search Engine</p>\n        <p>(<a href=\"Lectures/searching_software_cs221_2008.pdf\">Slides</a>) </p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>      </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 26</p>\n        <p>(Slides: <a href=\"Lectures/Lecture26.pdf\">PDF</a>, <a href=\"Lectures/Lecture26.mov\">QT</a>) </p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\">\n          <p><a href=\"Assignments/Assignment05.html\">Assignment 05</a> is due</p>\n          <p>(create a postings list)</p>\n        </div>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"pastDate\"><p> Thanksgiving Holiday</p>\n        <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vickispix/2089649326/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2016/2089649326_25dfa9fa9e_s_d.jpg\"/></a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"tableHighlight\">\n      <td valign=\"top\">Week 10</td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">December 1 </div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">2</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">3</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">4</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">5</div></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Evaluation in IR</p>\n        <p>(continued)</p>      </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 27</p>\n        <p><a href=\"Lectures/Lecture27.html/index.html\">Notes</a></p>\n        <p>Slides:<a href=\"Lectures/Lecture27.pdf\">PDF</a>, <a href=\"Lectures/Lecture27.mov\">QT</a> </p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 28</p>\n        <p>Slides:</p>\n        <p><a href=\"Lectures/Lecture28.pdf\">PDF</a>, <a href=\"Lectures/Lecture28.mov\">QT</a> </p>\n        <div class=\"somethingDue\">\n          <p><a href=\"Assignments/Assignment06.html\">Assignment 06 </a> is due</p>\n          <p>(rapid cosine querying)</p>\n        </div>        </td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"><p>Lecture 29</p>\n        <p>Slides:</p>\n        <p><a href=\"Lectures/Lecture29.pdf\">PDF</a>, <a href=\"Lectures/Lecture29.mov\">QT</a> </p>\n        <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhaithaca/1216805850/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1054/1216805850_358596a750_s.jpg\" alt=\"donut\"/></a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"tableHighlight\">\n      <td valign=\"top\">Finals Week </td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">8</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">9</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">10</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">11</div></td>\n      <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\">12</div></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/><a name=\"CurrentWeek\" id=\"CurrentWeek\"/>      \n      <td class=\"pastDate\"></td>\n      <td class=\"pastDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"presentDate\"><p>Final Exam Slot</p>\n        <p>Google Tour</p>\n        <p>Meet at 10:30am at the University Club Parking lot.</p>\n        <p>Google from 11am - 1 pm  </p>\n        </td>\n      <td class=\"futureDate\"/>\n      <td class=\"futureDate\"/><div class=\"somethingDue\">\n        <p><a href=\"Assignments/FinalProject.html\">Final Project</a></p>\n        <p>Last Chance Deadline </p>\n      </div>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ntry {\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-15170336-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n} catch(err) {}</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 33928.0}
