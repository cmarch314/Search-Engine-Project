office hours are to answer any questions you may have about solutions to quizes or homeworks You are highly advised to learn the correct solution to quizes and homeworks since I will typically re use

weekly quiz will be given every Friday at the beginning of lecture The quiz will be handed out at 9 AM sharp and will be picked up at 9 15 AM sharp There will be no make up quizes given When we tabulate your final grade we will drop the two lowest quiz scores and the two lowest homework scores However in exchange for this we will make absolutely no allowances if you arrive at a quiz late or turn in your homework late This holds even if you have a perfectly valid reason to miss a homework assignment or a quiz If for some reason you fail to make it to a quiz or hand in a homework assignment that will count as one of your dropped quizes or homework assignments no matter how legitimate your reason is There will also be one midterm on Monday of week 6 Grades for the assignements and quizes will be posted through EEE If you have questions regarding grading please see the person who graded that particular item Text This quarter you will be using a web based interactive animated

Completing the Course Evaluation 1 Note that there is a tiny bit of credit given for completing the course evaluation towards the end of the quarter It is available through EEE and is usually released a couple weeks from the end of the quarter If enough students complete the evaluation then I have access to the list of students who completed the evaluation However I do not see any evaluation results until the quarter is over and grades have been turned in Even after the quarter when I do see the evaluation results they are completely anonymous Thus there is no risk to you in being completely honest in your evaluation I take these evaluations very seriously and use them to improve my teaching Missed Midtern or Final Exam Policy The final exam will be on Wednesday December 11 8 AM 1 AM If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason you will receive a score of on the exam The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason There are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam An unforeseeable emergency such as a medical emergency In such cases I will ask for documentation An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance that I have approved in advance A work conflict is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam The examination times are announced at the beginning of the quarter so there is plenty of time to plan your work schedule If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved and it is not approved you will receive a grade of zero on the exam If I accept your reason for missing the final exam at my option I may either 1 give you a makeup exam or 2 assign your grade on the basis of the remaining course work that you did not miss If I give a makeup exam I may give it less weight than announced on the course web page Academic Honesty The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy Read it Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors registering for computing minors joining the ICS Honors Program and graduating from a computing major with honors Guidelines to avoid plagarism Do not look at another person s homework Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English This helps you to communicate clearly practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect Do not write down the solution in your notes It is perfectly fine and encouraged to collborate on work Working in a group is a rewarding experience and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard However you should avoid writing the solution in your notes It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own We expect that You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don t pass off your work as their own Your work honestly represents your efforts The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on If you do not perform the work yourself then you have cheated yourself out of the education Employers in our field can and do screen applicants for skills and knowledge You will perform poorly and discredit UCI if you do not practice now by doing your own work ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/f13-6B/courseinfo.html", "title": "none", "html":
