Graphical models, combining graph theory and probability\r\ntheory, facilitate a compact and structured representation for problems with uncertainty\r\nand provide a mechanism for answering queries such as computing the probability of\r\nan event given observations.<br>\r\nSeveral exact algorithms for reasoning with graphical models exist. However,\r\nexact computation is not always possible due to prohibitive time and memory demands.\r\nIn general, computing exact posterior marginals and even approximating posterior\r\nmarginals within a desired degree of precision is NP-hard. In practice, we often\r\nchoose methods that can quickly compute approximate answers to Bayesian queries,\r\ntrading accuracy for speed. Approximation methods include algorithms for approximate\r\ninference, stochastic sampling, network simplifications (simplifying the structure\r\nof the underlying graph), and variational approximations. We often obtain a more flexible\r\ncomputation scheme, balancing complexity and accuracy, by combining exact and\r\napproximate computation. This dissertation focuses on combining search with existing\r\nsampling and bounding methods yielding two new schemes for approximating and\r\nbounding posterior marginals in Bayesian networks. Those two new schemes, cutset\r\nsampling and any-time bounds, exploit the network structure to bound the complexity\r\nof exact computation.<br>\r\nCutset sampling for computing approximate posterior marginals samples only a\r\nsubset of variables, a cutset of the underlying graph. Since reducing the size of the sampling\r\nset results in lower sampling variance, cutset-based sampling converges faster\r\nthan sampling on a full set of variables. Two variants of cutset sampling algorithm\r\nwere developed. One, based on Gibbs sampling, is a general approach to collapsed\r\nGibbs sampling in Bayesian networks. The second algorithm implements the likelihood\r\nweighting on a cutset. The proposed any-time bounds framework is an any-time\r\nscheme for computing bounds on posterior marginals. It enumerates a subset of cutset\r\ntuples and performs exact inference over these tuples and then bounds the remaining\r\nprobability mass.<br>\r\nBoth methods exploit the problem\ufffds underlying network structure to control the\r\ntime and space complexity of the computations. They focus on finding a cutset of the\r\ngraph such that the complexity of exact reasoning is bounded when the cutset variables\r\nare assigned. The dissertation proposes a new algorithm for finding a minimum cost\r\ncutset that yields the specified complexity bound on exact inference.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r134.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 4823.0}
