people with unprecedented access to online information and services However because the information is unstructured computers cannot readily understand it This limitation helps explain why search engines and automated shopping agents don t work very well Tomorrow s Web will provide information and services in a structured form that is readily accessible to both people and computers For Internet commerce this means standard documents for describing things like products airline schedules stock reports and bank statements and corresponding forms for placing orders booking reservations and making transactions Thousands of companies will use such documents to publish information about themselves and their services directly on the Web where they ll be available to anyone or any web enabled application with the proper authorization FedEx and UPS for example will likely offer shipping services Citibank and Bank of America payment services and so forth Customers and suppliers will put these services on their intranets and integrate them into their core business processes and systems Businesses will build on each other s services using them as components to create innovative virtual companies markets and trading communities This ability to rapidly experiment with new business concepts will spark an explosion of entrepreneurial activity rivaling that of the web itself
