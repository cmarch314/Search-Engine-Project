{"text": "Research Projects News Notes CV Notes Plotting Box plots in Groups for Vectors of Varying Lengths Date 3 Mar 2 13 Back Story So this last week i was approached by my lab mate if i knew how to work with Matlab I said Yes very reluctantly He wanted to plot multiple box plots on the same canvas However the box plots were required to be grouped based on a specified configuration It seems it was the second part involving the grouping he could not achieve with Matplotlib He found the following library in Matlab which seemed to achieve the same http alex bikfalvi com research advanced matlab boxplot And hence the need for the knowledge of Matlab not to mention a licensed copy It seemed pretty straight forward and so i agreed to take on this seemingly benign task I mean it was just plotting a bunch of box plots However it was an important task as these plots would be inserted in his paper that he was submitting to a conference that was fast approaching So this concoction of complacency and high value of the task quickly proved that i should not have agreed to quickly That being said it was a good refresher in Matlab and it served as a good diversion from work Plotting multiple box plots on the same canvas The Matlab library above did not exactly work out This was because while this library did provide the ability to plot multiple box plots on the same canvas and specifically allowed for groupings it did not account for the data vectors that the box plots themselves were based on to be of different size more precisely of different lengths And so after trying a number of different things I resorted to the standard box plot library in Matlab A box plot in Matlab as one would expect takes in a matrix as its data source If the matrix is a vector then there would be one box If the matrix were 2 dimensional there would be a box for each column and that is how you would get multiple box plots on a single canvas However a matrix would never store multiple columns of varying sizes And this was a central requirement for my lab mate and his plots So i looked into groupings Box plot Groups allow for different values of one big vector of data values to be mapped to different boxes on the same canvas Consider the following vector and its group x 1 2 3 4 5 group 1 1 2 2 2 boxplot x group The above small code snippet suggests that values 1 and 2 correspond to a box plot 1 while value 3 4 and 5 correspond to box plot 2 And the code snippet boxplot x group would produce the following box plot Click here if you are unable to view the image properly in your browser boxplot Spatial Grouping of Box plots along the X axis That was simple enough The two box plots are based on two very different group of data sources of two different lengths But now I had to group these box plots together based on the horizontal X axis positions In order to do that I looked into the positions option You can explicitly define the X axis positions of each of the box plots as follows x 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 6 group 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 positions 1 1 25 2 2 25 boxplot x group positions positions The code above produces the following plot with the two sets of box plots grouped together along the X axis Click here if you are unable to view the image properly in your browser boxplot This is the plot when you fire the command without the positions option i e boxplot x group Clearly the groupings along the horizontal X axis have disappeared Click here if you are unable to view the image properly in your browser boxplot Color Fill To follow this up we wanted to color the boxes and as it turns out the box plot library in Matlab does not provide an option for color filling the boxes of the box plots To do that i turned to stackoverflow with this question which gave us the following piece of code And thus the wonderful piece of colored box plots in the figure to follow Oh and in case you do not understand the following piece of code the answer to the stackoverflow question gives a detailed explanation of the same x 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 6 group 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 positions 1 1 25 2 2 25 boxplot x group positions positions h findobj gca Tag Box for j 1 length h patch get h j XData get h j YData y FaceAlpha 5 end Click here if you are unable to view the image properly in your browser boxplot Colors for each Groups To make things more interesting I used a vector of colors to have different colors for different groups using this piece of code color y y c c and the use of color j in the for loop Resulting in an even more interesting figure x 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 6 group 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 positions 1 1 25 2 2 25 boxplot x group positions positions color y y c c h findobj gca Tag Box for j 1 length h patch get h j XData get h j YData color j FaceAlpha 5 end Click here if you are unable to view the image properly in your browser boxplot Conclusion And to top it all I used the plot2svg library to create SVGs out of the plots to preserve the details And viola we now had perfect SVGs that captured multiple box plots in one canvas based on vectors of different lengths for each box plot grouped spatially along the horizontal X axis and colored each group with their own different specific colors Tags matlab box plot colorfill groups Related Posts 11 Jan 2 15 Part of Winning Team UCI Data Science Hackathon28 Dec 2 14 Having
