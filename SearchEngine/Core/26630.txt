of COTS and New Software Technology Developments Friday August 28 1998 9 a m 12 noon McDonnell Douglas Auditorium University of California Irvine There is a 15 charge for non sponsors Checks should be made payable to UC Regents No reservations required Featured Speaker Dorothy McKinney Mission Success Director Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Company dorothy mckinney lmco com The way we engineer systems has to change if we are to make cost effective use of many of the products and new technologies in the marketplace These changes must address the relationship between system requirements definition allocation of requirements to software and selection of software technologies and off the shelf software packages At the same time we do not want to lose the benefit of the many lessons we have learned the hard way over the last 2 3 years about how to engineer systems that work and are supportable through their needed lifespans This talk discusses the impact of new technologies and the software marketplace on how systems engineering can and should be done Classical systems engineering first understands customer s needs and then translates these into system requirements which are then allocated to hardware and software for design and implementation However COTS packages often offer much of the needed functionality at a small fraction of the cost of new development but may include no easy way to add the remaining functionality needed So the largest challenge of systems engineering so COTS can be used cost effectively is how to define customer needs and system requirements so that available COTS packages can effectively be used in the system solution Effective approaches change both systems engineering processes and the relationship between the systems builder and the customers as well as the relationship between systems engineering and software engineering This session shares observations on the current state of the practice as well as hard learned lessons about what can work in the real world In addition participants will be asked to do exercises which give them a chance to make hands on decisions of the type facing systems engineers today with results illustrating the impacts on software engineering These exercises have no right or wrong answers just a variety of possible consequences of the various choices Participants should gain an appreciation of the key choices companies face today in how to approach systems engineering and the circumstances under which they should choose specific alternatives Biography Dorothy McKinney is
