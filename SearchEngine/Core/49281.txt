Ultimately top academic institutions are the temples of knowledge and one of the major activities that professors in these temples are involved is not just collecting knowledge from other places but also creating knowledge This knowledge creation process is a rigorous process Most research knowledge is initially distributed through what is commonly called research papers When somebody does research and creates knowledge that he she considers worthwhile that knowledge is formally reported in the form of a research paper Traditionally a research paper is just a draft until it is accepted by experts in the field of research is new knowledge The process of acceptance as a new knowledge is what is commonly called academic reviewing The process of reviewing is usually a very rigorous process Once a draft is submitted to a journal or a conference in the hope that the community will consider it new knowledge the editor or a group of editors selects three reviewers generally who are supposedly the experts in the field and sends the draft to them for reviews These reviewers are suppose to comment on many aspects of the draft ranging from novelty to contributions to language Editor then looks at the three reviews and decides whether the draft should be accepted or not if it is not accepted the comments are used by the researcher author to do further research and modification of the draft This process is fundamental to the progress of knowledge creation In fact this is fundamental to the progress of science Like most other interesting and useful things in life there are quirks of this review process also There are many famous stories about the reviewing that show the problem with this system For example the paper written by Tim Barners Lee I am reading his book so this is fresh in my mind there are many similar examples proposing World Wide Web was rejected by experts by saying that there is nothing new and everything is obvious to people working in the field Obviously Tim believed otherwise and continued his research and changed the world by bringing to us the Web that I am using to post this piece and became Sir Barners Lee I am talking about this because one of my student just received a review that shows problems with the framework Here are the reviews CONTRIBUTIONS This paper uses an event centric data model for clustering and presenting news stories Aa chronology of related stories is produced from the representation and clusters The UI to the application permits some degree of natural language queries as well as a graphical representation of event story locations KEY POSITIVE POINTS The examples from the demo application are fairly interesting and impressive showing a nice synthesis of information in the UI The data model for the events is also a good if limited contribution KEY NEGATIVE POINTS From the paper it is not clear what are the original contributions Most of the ingredients have appeared elsewhere or are well known The event data model is a fine idea but it s not clear to me that it stands on its own as the sole original contribution I find this review very interesting because synthesis of knowledge has been the basis of new knowledge all the time The above reviewer supposedly an expert in the field agrees that the work is interesting it accomplishes new things but the negative point is what is the original contribution Most of the ingredients are well known so their combination in a unique way to solve a real problem is not considered a new knowledge Boy I am sure people will kill to get the formula for CocaCola though all the ingredients used in it are well known In fact much of new knowledge is really synthesis of the components and it is this synthesis and the resulting combination that really advances all fields Hey one problem in academic review process is that a reviewer is anonymous So no body is suppose to know who wrote the above comments and that allows reviewers to be critical and as human nature is the anonymity also allows reviewers to be carelessly critical and prejudiced Believe me I am not complaining about this particular review because this is one of the minor problems I am posting this to hear from people about the review process because many communities are concerned about the current review process Many communities believe that time has come to revamp it significantly So I took the latest example that I saw and used that here to make a point By Ramesh January 26 2 6 General Updates 2 Comments McLuhan is OutNew Search Companies 2 thoughts on Academic Reviewing Dmitri January 27 2 6 at 9 7 pm Thats a very intresting and valid point The academic peer review process has it own set of loopholes There are have been instances where papers have been hopelessly criticised and beaten down by a reviewer only to find that the same idea has been used by him as an inspiration in subsequent journals conferences Abt the point you raised abt synthesis of knowledge how many original ideas have actually come out in the last 1 yr Arent all ideas inspired in one way or the other So what exactly does original mean Ramesh Post authorJanuary 27 2 6 at 11 22 pm And when you come with a real original idea the same reviewer will criticize you for being adhoc or non rigorous or just plain non sense This has happened to researchers in all fields and in many cases people were penalized by the society for being blaspemous This definitely does not suggest that reviews are not important it only suggests that time has come to review the review process Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked Name Email Website Comment You may use these HTML tags and attributes a href title abbr

There are have been instances where papers have been hopelessly criticised and beaten down by a reviewer &#8230;only to find that ..the same idea has been used by him as an &#8220;inspiration&#8221; in subsequent journals/conferences. </p>\n<p>Abt the point you raised abt synthesis of knowledge , how many &#8220;original&#8221; ideas have actually come out in the last 1 yr. Arent all ideas inspired in one way or the other ? So , what exactly does original mean ?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-ramesh bypostauthor odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-397\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-397\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4c7e700ac9901c23d82d2720e3664dbd?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Ramesh <span> Post author</span></cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/academic-reviewing/comment-page-1/#comment-397\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2006-01-27T23:22:47+00:00\">January 27, 2006 at 11:22 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>And when you come with a real original idea the same reviewer will criticize you for being adhoc or non-rigorous or just plain non-sense.
