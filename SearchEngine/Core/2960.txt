As presented, their method is restricted to the case\nwhere W, the weighted adjacency matrix, is positive definite.\nAlthough many common measures of image similarity (i.e. kernels) are\npositive definite, a popular example being Gaussian-weighted distance,\nthere are important cases that are not.  In this work, we present a\nmodification to Nystr&ouml;m-NCut that does not require W to be\npositive definite.  The modification only affects the orthogonalization\nstep, and in doing so it necessitates one additional O(m^3) operation,\nwhere m is the number of random samples used in the approximation.  As\nsuch it is of interest to know which kernels are positive definite and\nwhich are indefinite.   In addressing this issue, we further develop\nconnections between NCut and related methods in the kernel machines\nliterature.  We provide a proof that the Gaussian-weighted chi-squared\nkernel is positive definite, which has thus far only been conjectured.\nWe also explore the performance of the approximation algorithm on a\nvariety of grouping cues including contour, color and texture.\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/BelongieFCM_ECCV_2002/BelongieFCM_ECCV_2002.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nSerge Belongie, Charless Fowlkes, Fan Chung, and Jitendra Malik.\nSpectral partitioning with indefinite kernels using the nystr\u00f6m extension.\nIn <em>ECCV</em>, III: 531 ff. 2002.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@inproceedings{<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BelongieFCM_ECCV_2002,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Belongie, Serge and Fowlkes, Charless and Chung, Fan and Malik, Jitendra\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = {Spectral Partitioning with Indefinite Kernels Using the Nystr{\\\"o}m Extension},<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2002\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"ECCV\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pages = \"III: 531 ff.\"<br>\n}<br>\n<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2015 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2960.0}
