year integrated program The prerequisite for enrollment in this course is successful completion of University Studies 12A Throughout the year we ll be investigating computer games as artistic cultural and technological phenomena An important theme of this course is collaboration All but the simplest computer games are created by more than one person and when we study a computer game we participate in a dialog of sorts that includes the creators of the game other players society at large and ourselves We want to promote a collaborative spirit throughout the course while being cognizant of course of the need for each student to master the material individually and to received a grade based on his or her own performance At the conclusion of US 12ABC you will be able to identify the genre of a computer game and place the game in an historical context understand how computer game technology and techniques are used for purposes other than entertainment design new computer games based on a variety of themes patterns and genres implement simple code art and sound music within a computer game This course is the second in the three part University Studies 12 sequence The prerequisite for enrollment in this course is successful completion of University Studies 12A Because US 12ABC satisfies part of your lower division writing requirement in each quarter you will be writing research based college level papers You will learn to summarize an argument made by another writer respond logically to texts construct a thesis supported by sophisticated claims provide sufficient evidence to

is Failing We reserve the right to change the precise cut off points Except for the Labs and Discussion components scores are based on the quality of the work turned in not on the time spent or the effort expended Also note that there is no extra credit in US 12B Textbooks and Resources For the writing portion of the class you should have two books which are also assigned in Writing 39B Writing From A to Z fifth edition by Ebest Alred Brusaw and Oliu A Student Guide to Writing at UC Irvine 13th edition UCI offers several kinds of assistance to writers The website of the UCI Campus Writing Coordinator at http www writing uci edu has a great deal of information We particularly recommend the Writing and Library Research Peer Tutors and the Learning and Academic Resource Center LARC We are not assigning a specific textbook on Java programming but you may find it helpful to have one All books seem to cover much more of the language than you ll need for this class so we recommend looking over a few in the bookstore and choosing the one that seems the clearest to you There are also some valuable on line resources for Java however most of these do assume you have a programming background The Java Tutorial Java API Specification Java Coffee Break Policies Academic Honesty Do not claim as your own the words or ideas of others When you collaborate with or are helped by a classmate give credit When in doubt talk with a TA or professor before turning in your work A single act of cheating or academic dishonesty can seriously mar your career at UCI Familiarize yourself with the UCI Policy on Academic Honesty particularly Section C and Section D Authority of Faculty Members Add Drop Policy Students may add or drop US 12B up to the end of the second week of classes Jan 19 with the instructor s signature on an Add card Students may add only if they are caught up on all readings and assignments Students may drop after the second week only in exceptional circumstances Communication Check your UCInetID email frequently we will occasionally need to get in touch with you by email Please feel free to send email to the course staff use your UCInetID account put US 12 in the subject line and include your name in the message body This web page syllabus will be updated over the course of the quarter so please look at it regularly Health Even though you are young and reasonably healthy as a user of computers you are at risk for several computer related health problems particularly RSI repetitive strain injury Please read and follow the good advice at the Bren School s Computer Health and Safety web page Special Accommodations Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Prof Tomlinson privately to discuss his or her specific needs Also contact the Disability Services Center at 949 824 7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion Late Work The ten week quarter will pass very quickly and it is essential that all work be turned in on time so you can move on to the next assignment If possible contact your TA as soon as you realize an assignment will be late In general the policy is a 1 penalty for work up to 24 hours late 2 penalty for work 25 to 48 hours late and later work is not accepted without approval from a professor Lunch Not during class please Computers and Cell Phones in Class In lectures and discussions you may use a notebook computer to take notes but you must first disable your wireless connection to the Internet Playing of games is alas strictly forbidden Turn off cell phones during class Disputes on scores and grades If you think your work has not been correctly or fairly scored talk with your TA If you are still not satisfied talk with Prof Tomlinson All score disputes must be brought up within one week after the work is returned If you have a concern pertaining to your final exam score or your grade contact Prof Tomlinson before the end of the first week of the Spring quarter ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wmt/courses/US12B/us12b-syllabus.html", "title": "\nus

All books seem to\ncover much more of the language than you'll need for this\nclass, so we recommend looking over a few in the bookstore\nand choosing the one that seems the clearest to you.\nThere are also some valuable on-line resources for Java\n(however, most of these do assume you have a programming background):\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/\">The Java Tutorial</a>\n<li> <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/\">Java API Specification</a>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/\">Java Coffee Break</a>\n</ul>\n\n</p>\n\n<h2>Policies</h2>\n\n<h4>Academic Honesty</h4>\n<p>\nDo not claim as your own the words or ideas of others.\nWhen you collaborate with or are helped by a classmate,\ngive credit.\nWhen in doubt, talk with a TA or professor <i>before</i> turning in\nyour work.\nA single act of cheating or academic dishonesty can seriously\nmar your career at UCI.\nFamiliarize yourself with the\n<a href=\"http://www.senate.uci.edu/9_IrvineManual/3ASMAppendices/Appendix08.html\">\nUCI Policy on Academic Honesty</a>,\nparticularly Section C and Section D \"Authority of Faculty Members.\"\n</p>\n\n<h4>Add / Drop Policy</h4>\n<p>\nStudents may add or drop US 12B up to the end of the\nsecond week of classes (Jan 19), with the instructor's\nsignature on an \"Add\" card.\nStudents may add only if they are caught up on all readings\nand assignments.\nStudents may drop after the second week only in exceptional\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Communication</h4>\n<p>\nCheck your UCInetID email frequently; we will occasionally need\nto get in touch with you by email.\nPlease feel free to send email to the course staff:\nuse your UCInetID account, put <b>US 12</b> in the subject line,\nand include your name in the message body.\nThis web page syllabus will be updated over the course of the\nquarter, so please look at it regularly.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Health</h4>\n<p>\nEven though you are young and reasonably healthy,\nas a user of computers\nyou are at risk for several computer-related\nhealth problems, particularly RSI (repetitive-strain injury).\n<em>Please</em> read and follow the good advice at the Bren School's\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chair/comphealth2.html\">\nComputer Health and Safety</a> web page.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Special Accommodations</h4>\n<p>\nAny student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the\nimpact of a disability should contact Prof. Tomlinson privately to discuss\nhis or her specific needs.\nAlso contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as\npossible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a\ntimely fashion.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Late Work</h4>\n<p>\nThe ten week quarter will pass very quickly, and it is essential that\nall work be turned in on time so you can move on to the next assignment.\nIf possible, contact your TA as soon as you realize an assignment will\nbe late.\nIn general, the policy is a 10% penalty for work up to 24 hours late, 20%\npenalty for work 25 to 48 hours late, and later work is not accepted\nwithout approval from a professor.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Lunch</h4>\n<p>\nNot during class, please.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Computers and Cell Phones in Class</h4>\n<p>\nIn lectures and discussions, you may use a notebook computer to take notes,\nbut you must first disable your wireless connection to the Internet.\nPlaying of games is, alas, strictly forbidden.\nTurn off cell phones during class.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Disputes on scores and grades</h4>\n<p>\nIf you think your work has not been correctly or fairly scored, talk\nwith your TA.
