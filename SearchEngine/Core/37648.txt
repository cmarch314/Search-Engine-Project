Indeed, hierarchical structures were widely\nused in the first mainframe management systems in the early 1970s.\n\n<P>\nAs a case study, we'll consider the classic hierarchy from biology,\nthat of phylogeny.  Most biologists are aware that all living\norganisms can be placed in a hierarchy of kingdoms, genus and species.\nIf it were truly as simple as this it might be reasonable to organize\nas a three-level tree.  The Biota bioinformatics database, for example,\ngoes further with kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and\nspecies as seven different tables.  But even this is the tip of the\niceberg, as the NCBI taxonomy database, as used by GenBank, records\nthings as\n\n<P>\nsuperkingdom, kingdom, subkingdom, superphylum, phylum, subphylum,\nsuperclass, class, subclass, infraclass, cohort, subcohort,\nsuperorder, order, suborder, infraorder, parvorder, superfamily,\nfamily, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, subgenus, species group,\nspecies subgroup, species, subspecies, varietas and forma.\n\n<P>\nHence if NCBI used a top-down hierarchical data organization, looping\nover all the organisms in a database only requires 30 nested loops.\nThe problem is exasperated by the fact that the other major bioinformatics\ndatabases use a different hierarchy, and that different subtrees and\nbranches have different levels.\n\n<P>\nClearly, modeling such a hierarchy explicitly (even without the ambiguity\nof organisms belonging to multiple leaves of the hierarchy) has serious\nlimitations.\n\n<P>\nMore relevant to OEChem is the related problem of how to represent\nbiomolecules.  Once again, a naive structural biologist could be forgiven\nfor assuming it's a simple matter of organizing atoms into residues,\nand residues into chains for a simple three-level hierarchy.  Indeed,\nthis was a fundamental mistake made by the immensely popular RasMol\nmolecular graphics program that had exactly such a three-level structure.\nIn reality, the organization of a PDB file also requires multiple\nNMR models, crystal related symmetries, secondary and tertiary structural\nelements, folding domains, (active) sites, connected components, XPLOR\nsegment IDs and distinctions between proteins, nucleic acids, ligands and\nsolvent, and the distinction between backbone vs. side-chain atoms, and\ncategorization by ring system and cycle membership, heavy atoms and\nhydrogens.  Finally, let's not forget the alternate conformation indicators\nfor each atom or residue!\n\n<P>\nNotice, that this hierarchy also fails to be a \"strict\" hierarchy.\nA single syntactic chain may be split into multiple connected components,\nand multiple PDB chains may be covalently bonded into a single connected\ncomponent.  TER records normally serve as chain terminators but in several\nPDB files occur with a single residue.  Most chains are either ATOM or\nHETATOM, but peptidic inhibitors and post-translationally modified\nproteins are mixtures of both.  A single strand of a beta-sheet is always\nformed from a single chain, but a beta-sheet may be formed from stands\nfrom multiple chains.\n\n<P>\n\n<DIV CLASS=\"navigation\">\n<p><hr>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node220.html\"><img src=\"../icons/previous.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Previous Page\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node220.html\"><img src=\"../icons/up.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Up One Level\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node222.html\"><img src=\"../icons/next.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Next Page\"></A></td><td width=\"100%\" rowspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"center\" align=\"right\" height=\"56\" background=\"../icons/title_bkgd.gif\" colspan=4 class=\"navigation\">OEChem - Python Theory Manual\n<BR>\nVersion 1.3.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_1.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"contents.html\"><img src=\"../icons/contents.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Contents\"></A></td>\n<td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_2.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"genindex.html\"><img src=\"../icons/index.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Index\"></A></td>\n</tr></table>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Previous:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node220.html\">25.1 Ontology and Schema</A>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Up:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node220.html\">25.1 Ontology and Schema</A>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Next:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node222.html\">25.1.2 Set Theory to</A>\n<hr>\n<span class=\"release-info\">Documentation released on July 30, 2004.</span>\n</DIV>\n<!--End of Navigation Panel-->\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 37648.0}
