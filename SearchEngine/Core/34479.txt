Picking up a previous version of a page involves\ntraversing a link to an URL which has a timestamp decoration at the\nfront, so all local images, applets, and links are retrieved as of\nthat time as well.\n\nAs far as I know, no one has used this much more than for\ndisaster recovery, but I can check in with the GNN-DEVELOPER\nmailing list to see if anyone there has  comments.\n\n-Dave\n\nCome to think of it, this probably subsumes much of the need for\nconfigurations.  I can imagine if one were sophisticated, it would\nbe nice to declare \"configurations\" of asynchronous components, but\nI find that for most purposes, a configuration is equivalent to a\nsnapshot at a given time.\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0029.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"On standardization\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0027.html\">David J.
