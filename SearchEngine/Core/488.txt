On this quest he will want to bring with him several magical items, which each have a weight and a magical value. He has a magical pouch to contain these magical items. The pouch is limited only by the total weight it contains, i.e., the shape of the items are irrelevant. So, from his collection of magical items he want to fill his magical pouch maximizing the magical value contained within. You will write a program to determine which items he should bring. In CS 161 you learn how to develop an algorithm to solve this problem, but for now it will be given to you. You do not need to understand the algorithm, but you need to implement it in C++.</p>\n  \n  <h2 id=\"the-algorithm\">The algorithm</h2>\n  \n  <h4 id=\"input\">Input</h4>\n  <p>The input to the algorithm consists of:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>num_items</strong> : the total number of items</li>\n    <li><strong>pouch_size</strong> : the size of the magical pouch</li>\n    <li><strong>values</strong> : an array containing the values of the items, indexed starting from 1</li>\n    <li><strong>weights</strong> : an array containing the values of the items, indexed starting from 1</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>So, in the input arrays <strong>item 1</strong> will have value <strong>values[1]</strong> and weight <strong>weights[1]</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <h4 id=\"output\">Output</h4>\n  <p>The output of the algorithm consists of:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>output</strong> : an array containing the best items, index starting from 1 and 0 terminated</li>\n    <li><strong>max_value</strong> : the total value of the items in the pouch</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4 id=\"pseudocode\">Pseudocode</h4>\n  <p>The actual algorithm (in a Python like language):</p>\n  \n  <pre><code>M = 2D-array of size (num_items+1)x(pouch_size+1) initialized to 0s\n  B = 2D-array of size (num_items+1)x(pouch_size+1) initialized to 0s\n  \n  for i from 1 to num_items:\n      for j from 0 to pouch_size:\n      if weights[i] &lt;= j:\n          if M[i-1][j-weights[i]] + values[i] &gt; M[i-1][j]:\n              M[i][j] = M[i-1][j-weights[i]] + values[i]\n              B[i][j] = i\n          else:\n              M[i][j] = M[i-1][j]\n              B[i][j] = 0\n      else:\n          M[i][j] = M[i-1][j]\n          B[i][j] = 0\n  \n  r = num_items\n  s = pouch_size\n  output = 1D-array of size num_items+1 initialized to 0s\n  out_index = 1\n  while r &gt; 0 and s &gt; 0:\n      if B[r][s] == 0:\n          r = r - 1\n      else:\n          output[out_index] = B[r][s]\n          out_index = out_index + 1\n          s = s - weights[r]\n          r = r - 1\n  \n  max_value = M[num_items][pouch_size]\n  </code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Although this algorithm is short, it is written at a higher level than C++ and pays no attention to memory management.

A natural grouping into files would be to separate functions by the three tasks above. Your program must also run without any memory leaks, segfaults, or other memory access errors. In the end, I should be able to use the command</p>\n  \n  <pre><code>make run &lt; inputfile &gt; outputfile\n  </code></pre>\n  \n  <p>where <strong>inputfile</strong> is properly formated and get a properly formated <strong>outputfile</strong> with an optimal answer.</p>\n  \n  <h4 id=\"rules\">Rules</h4>\n  <p>For this project you may not use any C++ container classes or memory management features. Part of the purpose of this project is to learn about manual memory management. Thus, the only libraries (other than ones you wrote) you may include are <strong>iostream</strong>, <strong>string</strong> and <strong>sstream</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>To make sure that your code does not have memory errors you should test your program with the command</p>\n  \n  <pre><code>make memcheck &lt; inputfile &gt; outputfile\n  </code></pre>\n  \n  <p>which will produce a memory diagnostics report for your program.</p>\n  \n  <h4 id=\"starter-code\">Starter code</h4>\n  <p>The starter code for this project is a minimal program that compiles together with some data to test your project on.
