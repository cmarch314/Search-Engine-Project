According to recent estimates, three billion personal photos are uploaded to Facebook per month. This multimedia data\ncan be very useful for various applications like browsing, revoking old memories,\nsharing among friends or just for the entertainment value in viewing either one's\nown or friend's photos. Automatic organization of these photo collections is a\ndifficult and challenging problem because of their large sizes and the inability\nof computers to understand their content. Hence, any information need requires\nthe user to drill down through the entire photo corpus manually. This manual\nbrowsing is an inefficient and tedious process. This is one of the primary reasons\npeople shoot and store photos and seldom go back to them.\n\n<br><br>\nIn this research, we propose a framework for automatic generation of overview\nsummaries from large personal photo collections. These summaries are representtative subsets of the larger corpus and try to capture the important and relevant\ninformation, given the size constraints. They will enable users to get an overview\nof the interesting information in the photo collections without skimming through\nthe entire database. It will also help user to select photos which they want to\nshare with their friends. We also propose to come up with a framework for summarization and reccomendation of media shared in a social network.\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\nRelevant publications:<br>\nPinaki Sinha, Sharad Mehrotra, Ramesh Jain.
