Program Program Committee Workshop Chairs Iasonas Kokkinos Ecole Centrale Paris Charless Fowlkes University of California Irvine NEWS The submission deadline is now April 9th The electronic submission system is now online at https cmt research microsoft com POCV2 12 Theme Perceptual Organization is the process of establishing a meaningful relational structure over raw visual data so as visual primitives arising from the common physical cause are grouped together A driving motivation behind perceptual organization research in computer vision is to deliver compact representations and to reduce the space of hypotheses for higher level visual tasks Since early demonstrations in the 198 s underscored its usefulness in object recognition the computer vision community has seen various applications of PO in artificial vision systems such as in figure ground segmentation contour completion stereo matching model indexing change detection activity recognition and more Recent progress in PO has encouraged more participation from experts in related areas such as object recognition texture and motion analysis Because of its wide applicability the potential payoff from perceptual organization research is enormous Among the objectives of POCV is to encourage presentation of new ideas and facilitate discussion on the future of PO To this end papers introducing novel concepts will be considered for acceptance even if they lack full experimental validation The schedule will include longer periods for questions and answers after each talk than CVPR to enable dialogue and the exchange of ideas This POCV workshop will place a special emphasis on works that use PO to build a bridge between low and high level vision Invited Speakers Kristin Grauman University of Texas Austin Pedro Felzenszwalb Brown University Ronen Basri Weizmann Institute Jitendra Malik University of California Berkeley Scope Papers are solicited in all areas of perceptual organization including but not limited to image segmentation contour completion spatiotemporal motion segmentation figure ground discrimination integration of top down and bottom up methods perceptual organization for object or activity detection recognition unification of segmentation detection and recognition biologically motivated methods neural basis for perceptual organization learning in perceptual organization graphical methods natural scene statistics evaluation methods This POCV workshop will place a special emphasis on works that use PO to bridge the gap between low and high level vision Paper Submission Submission is electronic and must be in PDF format Papers must not exceed 8 double column pages Submissions must follow standard IEEE CVPR 2 column format of single spaced text in 1 point Times Roman with 12 point interline space All submissions must be anonymous Please us the IEEE Computer Society CVPR format kit All reviewing will be double blind so the paper must not include any information which allows the authors to be identified For example this might require that some references to the authors previous work be left blank or that authors refer to their previous work in the third person This is not optional Papers that provide obvious identifying information may be rejected without review As per conference policy camera ready versions of accepted papers will be submitted to IEEE and authors must submit the IEEE copyright transfer form Each paper is allocated 6 pages for no additional cost Additional pages up to 8 total are 1 page which must be paid with the author s registration No paper may be more than 8 pages One author of each paper must register for the conference by the camera ready due date or the paper will not be included on the conference DVD or in IEEE Explorer There will be 1 day registration too if anyone wants to just attend a workshop Otherwise the regular CVPR registration will cover all workshops as usual In submitting a paper to the POCV Workshop authors acknowledge that no paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop during the POCV review period Dual submission of accepted
