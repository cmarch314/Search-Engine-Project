Software development and operational\nuse are therefore dominated by human action, human judgment\nand decision making, and inevitably human error.\nThe outcome is, therefore, often uncertain and unpredictable\nand, along with uncertainty in natural phenomena, leads to\nunavoidable software uncertainties.\nMost if not all software failures are experienced by or\notherwise affect human users.  Similarly, most software\ndefects can be traced to human origins, be it an error\nintroduced directly by a developer or a defect that is\nonly indirectly human-related.  An IEEE software\nengineering standard, for example, identifies two key\nsources of software uncertainty as ``poor knowledge\nor understanding of the problem domain'' and\n``insufficient, untimely orientation to user needs and to\noverall quality''&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#IEEE9822\">IEE94</A>].\n<P>\nThe observation\nthat ``software engineering is fraught with uncertainty''\nis often used to explain the known symptoms of the\nsoftware crisis, including high costs and unexpected\nslips in development schedule as well as unpredictable\nfailures of operational software.  The abundance of\nuncertainty also justifies extensive measures taken\nby researchers and practitioners attempting to identify\nand alleviate software risks and uncertainties.\n<P>\nWhile software risk management has long been an active\nfield of research producing significant contributions\n(cf.&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Boehmriskbook\">Boe89</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#Boehmriskpaper\">Boe91</A>]), the subject\nof software uncertainties has largely been overlooked,\nwith the notable exception of software reliability\nmodels&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#littlewood79\">Lit79</A>] and models for validation\nof software dependability&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Littlewoodcacm\">LS93</A>].\nThis omission is particularly surprising in light of\nextensive research in modeling and management of\nuncertainty carried out in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) domains (cf.&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Pearl88\">Pea88</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#Neapolitan90\">Nea90</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#cacmuncertainty\">HMW95</A>]).\n<P>\nThus, despite the pervasiveness of human involvement\nand related software uncertainties, surprisingly few\nattempts have been made to model those uncertainties\nexplicitly.
