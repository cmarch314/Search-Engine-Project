nodes is a promising and popular research topic now Adapting to the current residual energy and moving patterns of a wireless and mobile device a service scheduler can achieve power efficiency and better QoS performance Imagine a situation that all service providers contact the same device at the same time with the same query frequently this will put much overhead on the thin client with unnecessary cost So this project tries to provide an agent based approach to managing a number of general services for each device Since it keeps the current status of the mobile and wireless node we

Hyunok Topic 1 On line Profiling Based Energy Reduction Video Conferencing This project aims to use the information available to the encoder to reduce energy consumed at the decoders In a typical video conference one device encodes the video stream and provides the compressed data to many decoding devices If the encoder can provide decoding time to each decoder then the decoder can apply DVS dynamic voltage scaling very efficiently However the problem with this is that it is very difficult to get the exact decoding time since the decoding devices have different platforms such as IPAQ Palm Zaurus Axim and so on Therefore in this project you will figure out which information is necessary for each decoding device to predict decoding time and how one can collect the information in the encoding device The Project will involve A Detailed Survey of related work in the area Formulating the problem Creating a new algorithm or method Setting up the Experimental Environment Experiment Algorithm revision A Final presentation Topic 2 Quality Adjustment Considering Energy Budget In this project you will need to work towards saving energy consumption in video conferencing Let us take an example Suppose there is an encoder A and 3 decoders namely B C and D Assume that D has low energy capabilities In order to reduce power consumption lets say that D tries to skip P frames However this skipping of P frames bears considerable image quality degradation if the ratio of I frame to P frame is large like say 1 1 which means that 1 P frames follows one I frame One possible approach to amortize this degradation into multiple decoders is that A changes the ratio of I to P frames to 1 1 which makes video quality worse for B and C but better for D since I frame requires more amount of bits than P frames You can investigate and come up with other approaches to address the problem The Project will involve A Detailed Survey of related work in the area Finding a problem Creating a new algorithm or method Setting up the Experimental Environment Experiment Algorithm revision A Final presentation Topic 3 Security in Video Conference To provide security requires additional computation and energy consumption In this project you will develop an efficient security algorithm which requires less computation but ensures security One possible approach is to provide encryption for I frames instead of P frames since a P frame is always dependent on an I frame The Project will involve A Detailed Survey of related work in the area Finding a problem Creating a new algorithm or method Setting up the Experimental Environment Experiment Algorithm revision A Final presentation Topic 4 Trade off between Security and Energy Consumption or Computation If you apply different security algorithms to a video encoder you can get different computation time or power consumption In this project you will need to figure out the tradeoff between the level of security provided and the power consumed by varying security algorithms The Project will involve A Detailed Survey of related work in the area Finding and formulating the problem Creating a new algorithm or method Setting up the Experimental Environment Experiment Algorithm revision A Final presentation Topic 5 Multiple Qualities This project involves devising and implementing an encoding decoding algorithm Let us consider an example Suppose there is an encoder A and 3 decoders namely B C and D Heterogeneous platforms of decoders have different display resolutions or computation power This means that A should provide a different compressed image to each decoder However due to constraints such as computation or power capabilities and network bandwidth it is not the most efficient approach Instead A should aim to provide one compressed data that has multiple qualities Each decoder uses a part of the compressed data for decoding The Project will involve A Detailed Survey of related work in the area Finding a problem Creating a new algorithm or method Setting up the Experimental Environment Experiment Algorithm revision A Final presentation Topic 6 Video Conferencing System Specification by using PeaCE PeaCE is a software tool where one can specify an algorithm simulate and generate implementing codes such as C and VHDL The video communication algorithm which means 1 1 communication has been implemented already This project extends the previous implementation to support multiple user communication or video conferencing The core of this project will be to design flow control The Project will involve Project specification Implementation Demo setup A Final presentation Adaptive Middleware Framework MPEG 4 1 Project Contact Vidya Topic 1 Designing GURU a MPEG 4 based middleware

modules to it without having to modify the existing architecture The basic adaptation framework is MPEG 4 based and modules are designed using MPEG J or Java Details can be provided upon request The

getting details of the MPEG 4 standard and also tools that might assist in the implementation process Sensor Applications using GloMoSim simulator 2 Projects Contact Qi Topic 1 Querying in Sensor Networks 2 2 students Sensors are typically deployed to gather data about the physical world Since sensors are resource constrained often sensor data is collected into a sensor database that resides at more powerful servers A natural tradeoff exists between the sensor resources bandwidth energy consumed and the quality of data collected at the server Blindly transmitting sensor updates at a fixed periodicity to the server results in a suboptimal solution due to the differences in stability of sensor values and due to the varying application needs that impose different quality requirements across sensors Paper HMV 4 proposes adaptive data collection mechanisms for sensor environments that adjusts to these variations while at the same time optimizing the energy consumption of sensors Project A Quality aware Aggregate Queries in Wireless Sensor Networks 2 students Paper HMV 4 only considers queries that request single sensor readings This project extends to aggregate queries which ask for the sum average min max of a group of sensor readings Hints Explore query locality subsequent aggregate queries may request data from a set of overlapping sensors so obtaining an update from those sensors not only benefits current query but also the next one In addition sensors can coordinate with each other while deciding its state transitions Relevant papers HMV 4 OW Project B Energy Efficient Data Collection in Wireless Sensor Networks 2 students There are basically three communication methods that sensor networks use direct communication multi hop or cluster based Paper HMV 4 considers the scenario where direct communication between sensors and the server is more efficient than the other two manners This project extends it to either multi hop or cluster based communication sensor networks depending on your interests Hints Re write sensor energy consumption formula in paper HMV 4 by taking into account energy consumption incurred due to the routing and derive the optimal point where energy consumption is minimized Relevant papers HMV 4 OW IGE HCB Topic 2 Fault Tolerant Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks 2 students Sensor networks are subject to higher fault rates than traditional networks connectivity between nodes can be lost due to environmental noise and obstacles nodes may die due to power depletion environmental changes or malicious destruction In order to guarantee certain level of delivery ratio of sensor readings a fault tolerant approach is desirable Hints This topic is very broad and has many possible directions to follow However for this project you are only expected to see how similar approach used for data management in mobile disconnected environments can be applied in this scenario Why are they relevant Relevant papers KKGS 1 TCO

In a typical video conference, one device encodes the video \r\n      stream and provides the compressed data to many decoding devices. If the \r\n      encoder can provide decoding time to each decoder, then the decoder can \r\n      apply DVS (dynamic voltage scaling) very efficiently. However, the problem \r\n      with this is that it is very difficult to get the exact decoding time \r\n      since the decoding devices have different platforms such as IPAQ, Palm, \r\n      Zaurus, Axim and so on. Therefore, in this project you will figure out \r\n      which information is necessary for each decoding device to predict \r\n      decoding time and how one can collect the information in the encoding \r\n      device.</span></p>\r\n      <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Project will involve</span></p>\r\n      <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">A Detailed Survey of related work in \r\n      the area</span></p>\r\n      <p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" \r\n      style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol\">\ufffd<span \r\n      style=\"FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n      </span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Formulating the problem</span></p>\r\n      <p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" \r\n      style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol\">\ufffd<span \r\n      style=\"FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n      </span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Creating a new algorithm or \r\n      method</span></p>\r\n      <p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" \r\n      style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol\">\ufffd<span \r\n      style=\"FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n      </span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Setting up the Experimental Environment \r\n      </span></p>\r\n      <p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" \r\n      style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol\">\ufffd<span \r\n      style=\"FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n      </span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Experiment &amp; Algorithm \r\n      revision</span></p>\r\n      <p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" \r\n      style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol\">\ufffd<span \r\n      style=\"FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n      </span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">A Final presentation</span></p>\r\n      <p style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt\">&nbsp;</p></td>\r\n    <td width=\"1%\" height=\"18\"></td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"10%\" height=\"19\"><b><font color=\"#ffff00\"><span \r\n      style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #999999\">&nbsp;Topic 2:&nbsp; \r\n    </span></font></b></td>\r\n    <td width=\"89%\" height=\"19\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><b>Quality Adjustment \r\n      Considering Energy Budget</b></span></td>\r\n    <td width=\"1%\" height=\"19\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"10%\" height=\"19\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n    <td width=\"89%\" height=\"19\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n    <td width=\"1%\" height=\"19\">&nbsp;</td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"10%\" height=\"19\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n    <td width=\"89%\" height=\"19\">\r\n      <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"en-us\">In this </span><span \r\n      lang=EN-US>project, you will need to work towards saving energy \r\n      consumption in video conferencing.

A natural tradeoff exists \r\n      between&nbsp; the sensor resources (bandwidth, energy) consumed and the \r\n      quality of data collected at the server. Blindly transmitting sensor \r\n      updates at a fixed periodicity to the server results in a suboptimal \r\n      solution due to the differences in stability of sensor values and due to \r\n      the varying application needs that impose different quality requirements \r\n      across sensors. Paper [HMV04] proposes adaptive data collection mechanisms \r\n      for sensor environments that adjusts to these variations while at the same \r\n      time optimizing the energy consumption of sensors.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><b>Project A.
