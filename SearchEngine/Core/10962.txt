However one can\ndo about a factor of two better by taking the edge midpoints of a single\nsimplex, giving (n+1 choose 2) points (this can also be viewed as a\ncertain slice through a hypercube).  E.g. in 4d the product construction\ngives 9 points while the edge midpoint construction gives 10.\n\nIn 3d both constructions give the same number of points (6),\nand there are two different 6-point pentagonal pyramids that also work.\n\nIn 5d you can get 16 points by taking every other point on a hypercube,\nslightly beating the 15 points produced by the edge midpoint construction.\n\nDid any of you make any more progress on the problem?  How about upper\nbounds?  Something like 4^n follows from Ramsey theory, and n + 2^(n+1)\nis not hard to prove (every point is determined to within two positions\nby its vector of distances from some n-tuple), but still seems very\nweak.  Is O(n^2) the right answer?\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:tim@maths.tcd.ie\">tim@maths.tcd.ie</A>, <A HREF=\"mailto:rdsilverman@qed.com\">rdsilverman@qed.com</A>, <A HREF=\"mailto:tfb@cogsci.ed.ac.uk\">tfb@cogsci.ed.ac.uk</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        follow-up on 2-distance set problem\n<B>Date:</B>           Thu, 01 Aug 1996 13:37:48 -0700\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nRe the message I sent you yesterday about the 2-distance set problem --\nI found it today while looking up something else in Croft, Falconer, and\nGuy, Unsolved Problems in Geometry, Springer, 1991 (it's problem F3,\np. 152).
