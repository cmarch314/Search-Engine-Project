Fiander: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<!-- body=\"start\" -->\n<pre>\nI've watched the discussions regarding the syntax and a little of\nthe semantics of augmenting the URL with version info, and I'd\nlike to feel the group out on something.  I honestly don't know if\nthis is within the scope of the versioning extension work or not\nat this point, but I'd like to find out.\n\nA couple years ago I was involved in a similar standardization\neffort (it was called Case Communique), and the idea was to\ncome up with a versioning extension for a message-based\nprotocol used by a set of software development tools.  The tools\nwere all made \"version smart\", and it was able to successfully\nallow \"plug-and-play\" of different version control and software\nconfiguration management vendors, which was one of the main\ngoals (the other was to obviously to enable version smart tools).\n\nWhile this effort was useful, I'd have to say that it wasn't very\nsatisfying.  The reason was that the tools needed to be more\nthan just \"version smart\".  They really needed to have knowledge\nof the broader notions of configurations (parallel development -\nespecially parallel release branches, the evolution of the project\nfile structure, dependency management, management of collections,\nand so on).\n\nI'm not denigrating versioning in any way, and I'm not even suggesting\nreplacing the versioning concept with this configuration concept.  I'm\njust more interested in this level above versioning and am wondering\nif that concept should be included in the discussions.\n\nIf Web tools were made \"configuration smart\" in addition to \"version\nsmart\", then rather than pass around version identifiers, they might\ninstead pass around release or configuration identifiers, which the\nserver might then resolve to a particular version of a given URL.\n(Note that I'm not just referring to version tags here, but rather some\nindicator of the release/configuration that implies not just the\nspecific version of each URL, but also the actual set and structure\nof the URLs.  For example, configuration \"release 3.0\" might have\none set and structure of URLs, but \"release 4.0\" might have a\ncompletely different set and structure.)\n\nThe more Web content that I see out there, the less useful specific\nversion id's seem to me (in the hands of the Web tools).  There\nis not a lot of meaning to \"version 12.1.2\" of one particular URL out\nof literally thousands.  However, \"release 4.0\" seems to me to be\nsomething that the Web tool might usefully present to the user and\nthen pass along with the URL to the server which would then lookup\nthe particular version id for that URL for that configuration.\n\nYour thoughts on this would be appeciated.\n\nMarty Cagan\nContinuus Software Corporation\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0009.html\">David J.
