{"text": "ICS 1 David G Kay UC Irvine Fifth Homework As usual you ll do parts of this assignment with a partner preferably someone you haven t worked with on a prevoius assignment Please do what it takes to get partnered up early in the week This is part of each assignment not doing it will lower your score This week again we need you to send a message to ics1 uci edu with the names and UCInet IDs of both partners Part a This is repeated from the previous assignment Read Chapters 1 and 3 of Blown to Bits which talk about the consequences of representing information digitally We ll be touching on this material in class Part b This part you can do without a partner Watch the video Sorting Out Sorting which beautifully illustrates nine different sorting algorithms Sorting the activity of putting items into some specified order is one of the most prevalent tasks in information processing according to Donald Knuth of Stanford perhaps America s most famous computer scientist It s about 3 minutes long here s a brief viewer s guide There s more detail in this video than you ll be responsible for We won t ask you about the specific algorithms they describe or about the mathematical characterization of their performance n squared or n log n We would like you to know the basic principle that there can be many different algorithms to do the same task that those different algorithms can have markedly different performance and that there s a difference between doing things in a straight line linearly and doing them hierarchically logarithmically by successively dividing the task into pieces Don t let your concentration waver during the boring parts that s when the funniest lines come The music is goofy in places Deal with it The best part of the film comes after the credits so don t quit when the credits start running It wouldn t be fair to expect Gravity or Captain Phillips here it s a film about algorithms after all But it is an excellent example of information visualization using graphics effectively to get a point across Part c For this assignment you will measure information how much space some object requires how much it might cost to store it how long it might take to transmit it Feel free to use a calculator spreadsheet or other tool such as the word count feature of Microsoft Word and to consult the web references we mention How much space is required by the web page you created for Assignment 2 For now let s just consider the text and not the images There are two different ways of measuring it The size of the text displayed in the browser You can get this by viewing your page selecting all the text copying it pasting it into a Word document and using Word Count The size of the HTML source to your page You can get this by choosing View Source in your browser and proceeding as above b 1 Figure out each of these quantities b 2 How big all together are the images on your page Write these answers into a document Word text PDF naming it in the usual form w5b jane12 joelee pdf and submit it via Checkmate Just one partner should submit one copy and the same partner should submit this part as the next part Part d Fill in the table below there s a copy available on line Save a copy of the document fill it out then use Downoad as PDF from the Google Docs File menu naming it in the usual form hw5c jane12 joelee pdf Submit this document via Checkmate Just one partner should submit one copy the file name and your Email message will let us give both partners credit Before you start make sure you know how many bits are in a byte and the difference between kilobytes KB and megabytes MB and kilobits Kb and megabits Mb This is a general characteristic of working with technical material The terms have very precise specific meanings and you can t work with them unless you understand them precisely Information packages Size in bytes or KB MB GB 5 How many copies of the information package can you fit on one of the storage media listed below Or how many of the storage media would it take to store one information package How much would it cost to store this information on 16 GB flash drives 6 How long would it take to download this information package using USB flash drives thumb drives 16 GB DVD R disks 4 7 GB 5 GB hard drive The 3G cellular network in a car 384 Kb sec 7 A 3 Mb cable

Project Gutenberg at www gutenberg org 3 Assume there s no sound involved 4 CD quality stereo sound involves two channels left and right Each channel takes 44 1 samples per second at 16 bits per sample 5 Use 1 KB 1 24 bytes 1 MB 1 KB 1 GB 1 MB and so on 6 Look up the price on line 7 Note that data transmission rates are typically given in bits or kilobits or megabits per second 8 In a black and white bitmap each pixel is one bit black or white typically represented by and 1 9 Multiply 5184 by 3456 That s where 18 megapixels comes from it s the total number of pixels in the image David G
