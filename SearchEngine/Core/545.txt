{"text": "Simple Linear Regression in R Birth Weight data Taken from Stat Labs by Nolan and Speed originally from the Child Health and Development Studies conducted at the Oakland CA Kaiser Foundation Hospital The variables are bwt baby s weight in ounces at birth gestation duration of pregnancy in days parity parity indicator first born 1 later birth age mother s age in years height mother s height in inches weight mother s weight in pounds during pregnancy smoke indicator for whether mother smokes 1 yes no The data will be read into R in data frame format which are arrays of data in which each case here an individual corresponds to a row and each variable corresponds to a column The row labels for these data frames are just row numbers the column labels are the names of the variables Only complete cases are included here Use the following command to load the data into your R session babies read table http www ics uci edu staceyah 2 1 data Bwt dat header TRUE sep Check that the data were read in correctly head babies tail babies dim babies For the dimension of a vector use the function length names babies is data frame babies We will take bwt to be the response variable For now consider gestation as the only predictor We will explore this data set in more detail using more predictor variables in the future The first step to any data analysis should be to explore the data plots and summary statistics Plotting in R Histograms Let s take a look at the distribution of gestation periods using a histogram hist babies gestation A histogram places each observation into pre determined bins where the height of the bin is the number of observations in that bin Our histogram doesn t look too good let s try a different bin size hist babies gestation breaks 4 The option breaks 4 tells R to break up the x axis into 4 bins Notice that the labels on the vertical axis are counts frequencies We could also look at the density histogram use hist babies gestation breaks 4 freq F When you use the freq F argument in hist you are asking for the density histogram which has total area 1 Area is proportional to relative frequency the count divided by the total number of observations For example in the interval from 28 to 3 the frequency histogram shows a count of 61 The height of that interval in the density histogram is about 247 and the width is 2 Thus the area for that interval is about 91 5 49 4 9 of the sample and 49 1236 is about 61 We can also add a smoothed density line to a histogram lines density babies gestation Note that the histogram must be on the density scale in order to add a smoothed density line In every plot function there are various arguments that add to the figure such as adding titles axes labels or color hist babies gestation breaks 4 col seagreen main Gestation Distribution xlab Days For a list of all the colors in R type colors Box Plots A boxplot is really not much more than a graphical display of a 5 number summary min 1st quartile median 3rd quartile max The body of the box represents the location of the quartiles with a line added at the median The whiskers or lines extending out from the box display the distance to the furthest observations which are no more than 1 5 times the inner quartile range Q3 Q1 from the quartiles Outliers are displayed as points or lines beyond the whiskers boxplot

to compare distributions of quantitative variables across categories boxplot gestation smoke data babies xlab Smoker no 1 yes ylab Gestation days Comparing Two Variables For the most part we will be interested not in just one variable but the relationship between two or more variables Depending on if the variables are quantitative or categorical this can be done in a variety of ways In order to refer to variables directly by name rather than preceding the variable name with babies let s attach the data set attach babies The plot function is a generic plotting function We can feed it one variable plot bwt Plots birthweight vs observation number or two variables scatterplot plot bwt gestation Order of arguments are y x where x is the x axis variable and y is the y axis variable Could instead use arguments x y e g plot gestation bwt or side by side boxplots plot bwt smoke or an entire data set plot babies What if we want to compare more than two variables If they are all quantitative we would need a 3 D scatterplot However if there are two quantitative variables and one categorical variable we can use a scatterplot of the two quantitative variables with plot symbols denoting the levels of the categorical variable Let s try this with gestation bwt and smoke plot bwt gestation type n main Bwt vs Gestation by Smoke xlab Gestation Days ylab Bwt Ounces type n tells R

defined above the variable r will be a dataset with 2 elements the first and third quartiles The final expression of the function is the value returned in this case the difference between the two

The variables names in the new data.frame need to match\n    the names of the original data set:<br>\n    <blockquote>\n      <pre>names(babies)<br></pre>\n      <pre>newdat = data.frame(gestation = c(200, 250, 300))<br>newdat\t\t# Print the new data.frame in the console.<br></pre>\n    </blockquote>\n    A 95% confidence interval for the mean response uses the \"predict\"\n    function with the argument \"interval = \"confidence\"\":<br>\n    <blockquote>\n      <pre>predict(mod, newdata = newdat, interval = \"confidence\", level=.95)<br></pre>\n    </blockquote>\n    We can also ask R to report the standard errors of the estimated\n    mean response:<br>\n    <blockquote>\n      <pre>predict(mod, newdata = newdat, interval = \"confidence\", level=.95, se.fit=TRUE)</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n    For a 95% prediction interval, use the argument \"interval =\n    \"prediction\"\":<br>\n    <blockquote>\n      <pre>predict(mod, newdata = newdat, interval = \"prediction\", level=.95)</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n    For more information on the predict function for lm objects, look at\n    the help file<br>\n    <blockquote>\n      <pre>?predict.lm<br></pre>\n    </blockquote>\n    Don't forget to detach data sets that you attached earlier <br>\n    <pre>detach(babies)<br><br><br></pre>\n  </body>\n</html>\n", "id": 545.0}
