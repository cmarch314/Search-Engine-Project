Also, I teach both graduate and undergraduate classes in parallel and distributed computing (e.g., COMPSCI 131, Winter 2014), parallelizing compilers (e.g., COMPSCI 243, Fall 2014) at UC Irvine.\n        Furthermore, I am the President of the Kernel-Panic Linux User Group (KPLUG), San Diego, CA.\n     </p>\n      <p>\n        In Spring 2013, I earned my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science from the <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California Irvine</a> \n        (UC Irvine).\n        I focused on issues in performance evaluation, with a focus on the statistical characterization of parallel programs and system performance. During my PhD program I proposed new and practical techniques for cross-system performance modeling, prediction and program optimization \n(refer to the following <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rcammaro/publications.html\">link</a>).  \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In Spring 2009, I earned my Master degree in Computer Science with a focus in Embedded Systems from UC Irvine. \n        I focused on issues in the estimation micro-architectural metrics, e.g., Last level of cache bandwidth, from the collection of hardware performance counters across multiple \n        executions of a program, when the number of counters that can be collected in one program execution is fairly small (tytically this number was limited to up to four counters when this work was developed).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In Spring 2004, I earned my Master Degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the <a href=\"http://www.unina.it/\">Universita' degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\"</a>, Naples, Italy. \n        I focused on the development of analytical models and their numerical implementation for the reconstruction of the electromagnetic \n        field intensity on the ground from airplain survey. Reconstruction algorithms were based on Tikhonov regularization theory.\n      </p>  \n\n      <p>\n        During my Ph.D. program I had the unique opportunity to join Internship Programs offered by top Internet, Information and Communication Technology companies in USA. For two summer and one fall quarters (2010-2011),\n        I joined <a href=\"http://info.yahoo.com\">Yahoo! Inc.</a>, Sunnyvale, CA, in the role of Performance Engineer Intern. At Yahoo! Inc. I developed novel \n        techniques for program characterization and performance modeling for <i>(a)</i> hardware procurement and <i>(b)</i> the selection of settings for integer \n        compiler heuristics.\n        <br> \n        For one summer quarter (2012), I joined <a href=\"http://www.qualcomm.com\">The Office of The Chief Scientist R&D, in Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.</a>, San Diego, CA, \n        in the role of System Security Architect Intern.  \n        <br>\n        Previous to my USA experience, I worked for a significant number of years in Italy, always being involved in Research and Development projects. From 2004 to 2008, I worked as Researcher for the Italian National Research Labs (CNR) in Naples, division of \"Cybernetics\", Italy, and as Lead System/Network\n        Engineer for a CNR start up company, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/siris-italia-s.r.l.?trk=top_nav_home\"> SIRIS Italia S.r.l.</a>. I developed \n        software for network, system and up to the application layer proactive and active monitoring. I taught several classes on advanced network, system\n        design and management. I coordinated small teams (4 to 10 engineers) on the field.\n      </p>\n  \n      <p> \n        I am member of the <a href=\"http://www.cecs.uci.edu/\">Center of Embedded Computer Systems</a> at UC Irvine, \n        <a href=\"http://www.acm.org\">Associations of Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>, \n        <a href=\"http://www.ieee.org\">IEEE Computer Society</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.ordineingegnerinapoli.com/\">Order of Engineers of Naples</a>, Naples, \n        Italy\n        <br> \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Thank you for the time that you spent reading my short biography.
