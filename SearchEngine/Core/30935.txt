Interestingly, in my family, there are Millers descended from a\r\n Pesach Langsam. Do you have the time or inclination to explore this any\r\n further?\r\n I have a website at\r\n www.langsam.com\r\n\r\n -Moishe Miller\r\n moishe @langsam.com\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nSubject: Re: Langsam-Miller Connection\r\nTo: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure that I have any more info that is of help to you.  Here is \r\nwhat I have:\r\nPhillip Miller b. 1886 Cleveland\r\n               d. 9 Dec. 1945  Cleveland Hts\r\nmar.\r\nDora Marcusson  b. 1891  Cleveland\r\n                d. 12 May 1932  Cleveland Hts\r\nThey had two children:\r\nWilma  (whom I have met but lost touch with)\r\n  she married a Wolfenstein\r\n\r\n\r\nMarge  who mar. a Langsam\r\n\r\n\r\nI will contact Gary Silverstein in Cleveland and see if he knows how to\r\ncontact her.  If you haven't heard from me in a week, please remind me.\r\nDavid\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nDate: Tue, 18 Jul 2000 21:34:20 -0400 \r\nSubject: Miller Family \r\nFrom: \"David Attride\" <dattride@mounet.com> \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\n\r\nI found Wilma Miller Wolfenstein.  I hadn't communicated with her in about\r\n15 years but remembered that she lived in the Pittsburgh PA area and\r\nfortunately, she still does.  Her husband's name is Lincoln Wolfenstein and\r\nthey are retired.  Their telephone number is 412-421-9666.  She was rather\r\nactively involved in her family genealogy (mostly the Marcusson side, her\r\nmother's surname) 10-15 years ago.  She was pleased to hear from me and is\r\nstill interested in genealogy.  I asked her a bit about the Millers and here\r\nis what she told me:\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac Miller was from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and spoke Hungarian.  He\r\nemigrated to Cleveland, OH about 1875.  He died in 1925.  His wife was\r\nCarrie Green who died in 1920.  Carrie's father was from Frankfort-am-Mein\r\nand emigrated to Cleveland about 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac and Carried had a son, Phillip, born in Cleveland in 1886.  In 1915,\r\nhe married Dora Marcusson (who was born in 1891).  He passed away in 1945\r\nand she in 1932.  They had two children:\r\nWilma  born 1919  mar. Lincoln Wolfenstein\r\n\r\n\r\nMarge  born ?? (I forgot to ask) who married Jerome Langsam.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe didn't at all seem to mind the questions but I wasn't sure how much more\r\nto ask, except that Marge Langsam is still living.  Hope you find a\r\nconnection.  Feel free to contact Wilma for more info or for a telephone\r\nnumber for her sister, Marge.  Unfortunately, Wilma says she is computer\r\nilliterate but wonders if she could learn to use the Internet.  I suggested\r\nshe join a Pittsburgh genealogy society and get them to help her.  Perhaps\r\nshe will become more actively involved in genealogy.  Let me know if there\r\nis more I can do and I am interested to learn if you find a connection.  I\r\ntook a look at your website - very excellent!  I have a very basic website\r\nbut no genealogy info on it.  I stay so busy gathering more info that I\r\nstruggle just to keep my genealogy database up-to-date.  Take care\r\nDavid Attride\r\nJonesborough, TN \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\n  \r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 6/22/04</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "id": 30935.0}
