PGP to encrypt and or sign the email correspondences with your Class Reader Patrick Flynn As we ve gone over in class encryption is the process of securing communication and doing so involves just a few easy steps Instructions The first step is to determine the operating system OS that you will be using Once you ve completed that difficult task it s on to using Thunderbird to encrypt your emails You can of course use other clients to encrypt your mail in which case you may ignore the steps described below The steps below assume that you are using Thunderbird Thunderbird Thunderbird will allow you with a bit of tinkering to securely send emails through the use of an encryption algorithm to your friend Bob For this assignment your Class Reader Patrick Flynn will be the recipient of course Step 1 Download Thunderbird and install it To configure Thunderbird for your email service follow the appropriate instructions below or use those for your email provider Gmail Thunderbird setup instructions UCI Thunderbird setup instructions ICS Thunderbird setup instructions Step 2 Download a PGP program Windows Users Download Gpg4win Mac Users Download Mac GPG Step 3 Windows Users Follow the on screen instructions for installing Gpg4win When the Choose Components box shows up all you need to select is GnuPG and GPA Optionally you can select the manuals at the bottom if you want to read more about encryption or keep them for future reference Remember the location you install GPG in as you will need it shortly Mac Users Install Mac GPG Step 4 Download the Enigmail extension for Thunderbird and save it somewhere Step 5 Once you ve downloaded Enigmail in Thunderbird open Tools Add ons Install and then choose the Enigmail extension file Step 6 When you ve restarted Thunderbird

Program Files GNU GnuPG gpg2 exe For Mac it s most likely in usr local bin gpg In order for other people to send you encrypted messages they will need your public key There are a number of keyservers which host such public keys but for our purposes we will be using pgp mit edu Go to the Keyserver tab and make sure pgp mit edu is listed in the dialogue box If you don t see a Keyserver tab click on Expert Settings Step 7 Now you ll need to generate your public private key pair From the OpenPGP menu item choose Key Management From the Generate menu choose New Key Pair Choose the email address you

revocation certificate and save it Step 9 Publish your key by selecting it in the key management window clicking the Keyserver tab and selecting Upload Public Keys Sending Encrypted Signed Emails Now that you ve followed these instructions it s time to let your Class Reader Patrick Flynn know that you are capable of sending encrypted messages Of course this process should be done from your email
