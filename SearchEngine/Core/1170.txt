about 8 the median was about 22 or about 86 Look at your returned work carefully if your score was below 2 which is 8 you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA Material similar to this will be on the first written exam Always see your TA Reader first for grading issues with Quizzes Each TA Reader graded all the students in class on their specific problem s Contact these TAs Readers if you feel that your problem was graded incorrectly they will email me and cc you about any corrected grades Problem 1 TA Igor Burago Problems 2 3 Reader Jordan Villanueva Problem 4 TA Julian Lettner Entering Data Reader Saeed Mirzamohammadi There are two files that you should download unzip and examine to understand you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class Each is sorted by Unique ID To compute your Unique ID go to the grades spreadsheet that is available from the index on the course web and go to the tab labeled UniqueID and enter your ID in the green cell A2 and press Enter your Unique ID will appear to the right in cell B2 The first file to examine stores the assignment grades a zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this instrument why points were deducted You will see the number of point deducted in columns G J Columns G and J will show point deductions on the returned quiz itself columns H and I have comments for deductions The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from the index on the course web it records all the grades for all the testing instruments that I assign over the quarter It is sorted likewise You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to integers so receiving a 22 5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 23 on the second one We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter The TAs will return your written quizzes during their common lab hours Please download the Grades zipped xlsm file from the course web and ensure that I have computed and entered your grade correctly I ll be entering thousands of grades for students in my courses this quarter so even if I m 99 accurate I m likely to record some incorrect grades Note that all grades are recorded as integral values I always round up e g a quiz score of 22 5 is recorded as 23 If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly please contact the TA reader first and tell him her what you think the differences are Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes either he she will agree with you that you deserve more credit and we do want you to receive all the credit that you are due or you will come to understand the question program or solution better This is certainly a win win situation Please read the solution and assignment grades spreadsheet carefully before contacting your TA Reader and ensure you understand the correct answers The TA Reader will then re examine issue possibly asking you for more information if there is still confusion or arranging to talk to you If there is a difference your TA Reader will email me a revised summary about your program and cc a copy to you I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate it might take a bit of time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade If you feel there is still a problem after talking to your TA Reader please contact me but always contact your TA Reader first Also because of the size of this class if you have a grading issue you must bring it to your TA s Reader s attention within a week of when I return the materials Generally exams and quizzes are graded more closely than programming assignments If the average on any testing instrument is less than 75 the column for that instrument will show the number of normalization points the number of points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument s average be 75 these number of points are then added to the sum of the points for each student in a later column This is the only curving I do in grading On this testing instrument and typically most others except the written and programming exams the normalization points are 8 2

are two files that you should download unzip and examine to understand you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class The first stores the assignment grades a zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this instrument why points were deducted You will see the deducted points in cells If you hover over a commented cell those with a red triangle in the cell s upper right hand corner you will see a comment that explains why the points were deducted You might have to right click the cell and edit the comment to see all of it This file is is sorted by your Unique ID The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from the index on the course web it records all the grades for all the testing instruments that I assign over the quarter It is sorted likewise by Unique ID You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to integers so receiving a 57 5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 58 on the second one We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter This assignment was designed to test if you have mastered using linked lists and variants of linked lists in the context of implementing classes in the ICS46 Template library including iterators over these data types Essentially you did the same thing implementing a data type three times but each with a different data type and each with a different data structure The class average was 51 or about 85 and the median was 59 or about 98 There were about 67 As 8 Bs 5 Cs and 2 Ds and Fs Individually the percentages without including early submissions were Linked Queue 87 Linked Priority Queue 75 and Linked Set 67 There were 13 students submitting two days early and 8 submitting 1 day early It seems like a lot of students didn t submit which might mean that they partner with a student who did not list their partner s name in the submitted code if this is the case then I will enter grades for both submitter and partner deducting 2 points IMPORTANT If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly please the TA Reader responsible and explain the problem Please read the comments in the assignment grades spreadsheet carefully and look at my solutions before contacting anyone to ensure that you understand the correct answers The TA Grader will then re examine issue possibly asking you for more information if there is still confusion If there is to be a grade change the TA Reader will email me and cc you I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate it might take a bit of

5 Reader Jordan Villanueva Generally most students did well on all the problems In problem 1 some students do not know the technical definition of height In problem 3 4 some students did not correctly use base cases and or they checked for nullptr in cases other than the base case In problm 4 some students did not call all less and all greater and instead just checked each root against its children as we discussed in class this is not correct other students did not call is BST recursively on its children the condition must hold for each node in the tree In problems 3 4 I deducted points for overly complicated solutions involving multiple if statements or local variables Finally in problem 5 some students did not build the correct heap there is a unique one everyone should have drawn Other student did not draw a box around the nodes actually removed for example the root node is NOT removed although its value is or percolate the values the correct way To see your grade now examine

was lack or time or some other issue that causes a poor performance Possibly you barely passed ICS 45C but really don t understand the material or how to program as well as most of the other students I m happy to talk to students who feel ill prepared for this course and would like to explore their options 2 1 5 15 Install Course Software All students with computers should download and install the Course Software Java to run Eclipse C and Eclipse along with the courselib and googletestlib libraries All three products are available for free on the internet note that Java is already installed on Macs Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software by following then Course Software link There follow the instructions for Java MinGW and Eclipse and download run stltest project Course Library Installation and Use GoogleTest Installation and Use and download run TestGoogleTest project You may complete the assignments using whatever software you want but Eclipse using C and MinGW will be the official course software I strongly recommend that you become familiar with these systems during the first week of the quarter Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers in the UCI labs I expect students with computers to download and install this software by the end of the first week of the quarter If you are having difficulty with this task the TAs and Lab Tutors will help you during the first Common Lab meeting all students will be able to see staff at prearranged times even though there is no formal lab to attend in this class or beyond if necessary bring your computer to the lab if you have successfully downloaded and installed this software please help other students do so too Finally you can also use the class MessageBoard Forums to ask questions about this software and help other students 1 1 5 15 First Message Welcome to ICS 46 I am going to post and archive important messages about the class in this announcements web page each entry will be numbered dated and labeled The entries will appear in reverse chronological order Whenever you follow the link to this page scan its top for new announcements scan downward for older announcements This message will always appear at the bottom of this file I will never remove a message from this page although a subsequent message may cancel a previous one in such a case I ll refer to the number of a canceled message in the message that cancels it Expect a few new messages to be posted here each week mostly regarding graded work Check this Announcements

answers incorrectly, please\r\n  contact your TA/reader first and tell him/her what you think the differences\r\n  are.\r\nHere are the grading assignments throughout the quarter.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last name starts with A-G: contact TA Igor Burago\r\n<li>Last name starts with H-L: contact TA Julian Lettner\r\n<li>Last name starts with M-S: contact Reader Saeed Mirzamohammadi\r\n<li>Last name starts with T-Z: contact Reader Jordan Villanueva\r\n</ul>\r\nSuch a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he/she will agree\r\n  with you that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the\r\n  credit that you are due), or you will come to understand the question,\r\n  program, or solution better.\r\nThis is certainly a win-win situation.\r\n<p>\r\nPlease read the solution and <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully\r\n  <b>before</b> contacting the TA/Reader and ensure you understand the correct\r\n  answers.\r\nThe TA/Reader will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more\r\n  information if there is still confusion, or arranging to talk to you.\r\nIf there is a difference, the TA/Reader will email me a revised summary about\r\n  your program, and cc a copy to you.\r\nI will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of\r\n  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).\r\nIf you feel there is still a problem after talking to the TA/Reader, please\r\n  contact me (but always contact the TA/Reader first).\r\nAlso, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, you must\r\n  bring it to your TA's/Reader's attention within a week of when I return the\r\n  materials.\r\n<p>\r\nGenerally exams and quizzes are graded more closely than programming\r\n  assignments.\r\nIf the average on any testing instrument is less than 75%, the column for\r\n  that instrument will show the number of normalization points: the number of\r\n  points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument's\r\n  average be 75%: these number of points are then added to the sum of the\r\n  points for each student (in a later column).\r\nThis is the only curving I do in grading.\r\nOn this testing instrument (and typically most others, except the written and\r\n  programming exams), the normalization points are 0.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you scored very low on this quiz, you should ask yourself whether you are\r\n  properly prepared for this course (or whether it was lack or time, or some\r\n  other issue that causes a poor performance).\r\nPossibly you barely passed ICS-45C, but really don't understand the material or\r\n  how to program as well as most of the other students.\r\nI'm happy to talk to students who feel ill-prepared for this course and would\r\n  like to explore their options.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\"

download and install the Course Software:\r\n    Java (to run Eclipse), C++, and Eclipse (along with the <b>courselib</b>\r\n    and <b>googletestlib</b> libraries).\r\n  All three products are available for free on the internet.\r\n    (note that Java is already installed on Macs).\r\n  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software\r\n    by following then\r\n

<b>strongly</b> recommend that you become familiar with these systems during\r\n    the first week of the quarter.\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers\r\n    in the UCI labs, I expect students with computers to download and install\r\n    this software by the end of the first week of the quarter.\r\n  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help\r\n    you during the first Common Lab meeting (all students will be able to see\r\n    staff at prearranged times, even though there is no formal lab to attend in\r\n    this class), or beyond, if necessary: bring your computer to the lab; if\r\n    you have successfully downloaded and installed this software, please help\r\n    other students do so too.\r\n  Finally, you can also use the class MessageBoard Forums to ask questions about\r\n    this software and help other students.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\"
