While in traditional orthogonal layouts every edge is made of a\nsequence of axis-aligned line segments, in smooth orthogonal layouts\nevery edge is made of axis-aligned segments and circular arcs with\ncommon tangents. Our goal is to create such layouts with low edge\ncomplexity, measured by the number of line and circular arc segments.\nWe show that every biconnected 4-planar graph has a smooth orthogonal\nlayout with edge complexity 3. If the input graph has a complexity-2\ntraditional orthogonal layout, we can transform it into a smooth\ncomplexity-2 layout. Using the Kandinsky model for removing the\ndegree restriction, we show that any planar graph has a smooth\ncomplexity-2 layout.\n</p>\n<p>\n(Graph Drawing '12 paper by M. A. Bekos, M. Kaufmann, S.
