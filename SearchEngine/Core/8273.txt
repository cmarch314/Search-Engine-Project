These are all part of standard project management training.  But in addition, I teach them how to manage people, to select people for a team, motivate them to do good work, give and receive feedback, etc.</p> \n\n<h2><a href=\"#\" name=\"inf163\">ICS:  Informatics 163  Project in Social Implications of Computing.</a></h2>\n<p>  Students work in groups to identify the needs of an office, service, a team.  This year we experimented using Contextual Design, with students doing deep interviews of tasks, culture, resources, communication, etc. resulting in notes that are organized by theme, leading to recommendations.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"#\" name=\"inf191a\">ICS:  Informatics 191A  Senior Design Project.</a></h2>\n<p>Students in Informatics are required to cap their undergraduate experience with a 3-quarter design project.

It is my role this year to infuse the course with more usability engineering in the software design process, including interviewing potential users, developing personals and scenarios leading to use cases, etc. </p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n</div> <!-- container -->\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 8273.0}
