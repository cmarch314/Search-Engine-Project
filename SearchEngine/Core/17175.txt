The primary role of this repository is to enable researchers in knowledge discovery and data mining to scale existing and future data analysis algorithms to very large and complex data sets.\n\n<p> Creation of this archive was supported by a grant from the Information\nand Data Management Program at the National Science Foundation.\nThe archive is intended to serve as a permanent repository of\npublicly-accessible data sets for research in KDD and data mining. It\ncomplements the original \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html\">\nUCI Machine Learning Archive\n</A>, which typically focuses on smaller classification-oriented data sets.\n\n<p>We are seeking submissions of large, well-documented data sets that can be made publicly available.
