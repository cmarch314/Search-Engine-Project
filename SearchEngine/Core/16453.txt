In the first public presentation after the model's release,\nmembers of the CMMI project will talk about the details of the\nnew model (termed the CMMI-SW/SE) and appraisal methods, and changes\nfrom version 1.1.\nInformation on how to obtain the new model and appraisal documentation\nwill be provided.\n\n<P>\nThe CMMI project is a collaborative effort sponsored by the Office of\nthe Secretary of Defense/Acquisition and Technology\n(OSD/A&T), with participation by government, industry, and the Software\nEngineering Institute (SEI). The project's objective\nis to develop a capability maturity model integrated product suite that\nprovides industry and government with a set of integrated\nproducts to support process and product improvement. The project's\noutputs include integrated model(s), assessment method(s),\nand training materials.\n\n\n<P>\n\n<MMI project's objective is to improve the usability of the CMM\ntechnology in a wider set of disciplines than simply\nsoftware. The concept calls for use of common terminology, common\ncomponents and rules for constructing capability models,\nto reduce the training and process improvement effort needed by users of\nmultiple disciplines. In the initial phase, the scope of\nthe CMMI project is restricted to the most needed disciplines: software\nengineering and systems engineering. The initial set of Capability Models \nto be produced include:\n\n<DL>\n<DD><LI>Software CMM (in both staged and continuous representations)</LI></DD>\n<DD><LI>Systems Engineering CMM</LI></DD>\n<DD><LI>Software and Systems Engineering CMM</LI></DD>\n</DL>\n</UL>\n\n<P>\nThe public release of the draft is your opportunity to provide comments \nof the new structure and content of the CMM. \n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biographies: </strong>\n<p>\nDr. Jack Ferguson, \n<A HREF=\"mailto:jrf@sei.cmu.edu\">jrf@sei.cmu.edu</A>, is the Program \nManager for CMM Integration.
