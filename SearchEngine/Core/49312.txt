information needs for the current events one must also consider how past and future events should be represented Today I thought of presenting some ideas about past events Let us assume that we have the infrastructure to capture what we want to do to realistically represent past events and provide a better than being there experience to visitors Let us also assume that processing power broadband communication infrastructure and storage networks are available to meet our needs In other words our goal today is to dream about how we would like to experience past events if we had all infrastructure available to us This will also help us later in thinking what infrastructure will be required to present quality experience to visitors Suppose that an event is taking place in an area and we put several cameras microphones and other sensors to capture what is going on there There could be RFID or similar sensors to identify people or objects participating in the event There could be many other information sources such as commentary scripts about the event Similarly there could be databases capturing what went on in the event and updating statistics particularly in sports In summary there could be disparate sensors databases and other information sources Most sensory data maybe collected at the time of the event but some other data may become available only after the event All the sensory data that is collected during the event should be time synchronized Time is the most important dimension in event capture Location and viewpoint of the sensors will help in creating a spatiotemporal environment with relevant attributes at every point in this environment A very important decision that the system designer will have to make is what important attributes of the environment are of interest to the visitor These attributes will determine what sensors should be used where and how they be placed and how to assimilate data from these sensors to get the required attributes For example current sports events producers may decide that it is only the score that a user is interested or that action new the ball is of interest and hence a video of that will represent what is going on On the other extreme an immersive presence offering a user any position on the field or around it to experience the event may be offered to provide better experience The final experience will determine what data should be collected and processed Effectively using all data from disparate multifarious data sources the system needs to create a time machine TM for the event This TM is a database of all sources indexed using time and important parts or subevents We need to consider an event to be a hierarchical concept in which using several primitive or atomic events more compound events could be built At atomic event is the event that can not be split into sub events Again this will be an important decision for designers to consider what should be atomic events An atomic event may be determined both by the application context as well as the technology that is available to capture and represent those Using these atomic events one could build compound events The process of building compound events is a process that could be extended to many levels There should be a language or grammar to build compound events using atomic events This is similar to the nature of languages both natural as well as programming The task of developing compound events from atomic events is also dependent on the application area and what resolution and granularity should be offered to a visitor These are the decisions that will be made at the design time and will affect what could be presented to a visitor and what could be experienced by him If we offered all time and location indexed sensory data to a visitor and forced her to specify what she wanted to experience by specifying the sensors then the application will be uninteresting to most people What needs to be presented is a semantic interface for selected which part of the event needs to be experienced from which position That means that a visitor to a past event should be able to specify a specific sub event from a specific position An example would be show me the three pointer scored at the buzzer by Allen Iverson from the position behind him or from the position of the coach To do this the system should be able to compute which sensors should be used over which time interval In some cases the system may have created a complete attribute space for the event and it will select rendering techniques to present correct subsection of this environment over the selected interval In past events the system could compute highlights that may be of interest to users and present those highlights to the user A user can then select which highlights are of interest and from which viewpoint and could experience those This may also be extended to preparing a personalized highlight reel for a user The database could also have a facet based on participants or objects in the event Thus a user could see all plays in which a player X participated Or one could see only those parts of the wedding in which bride s sister or brother were active What is being accomplished is to create this multidimensional database containing time indexed sensory data linked with other information and data assimilated from different sources and provide a user ability to slice and dice this database to access semantically the events of interest The event experience will be recreated using the sensory data and will be augmented using other data and information sources to provide better than being there experience I am sure I have covered only a subset of features but this is intended not to be exhaustive but to be suggestive of how past events could be experienced and what should be the goal of systems to provide to users By Ramesh May 3 2 5 Experiential Computing 1 Comment Capturing Reality of EventsInformation and Experience 1 One thought on Experiencing past events Joe May 5 2 5 at 2 17 am This entry about experiencing past events reminded me of a Japanese movie I recently saw titled After Life The premise is that after you die you can take one memory of your previous life with you to the next life in the form of a video recording that recreates the memory you choose Though fiction it details the process people go through to select and recreate a memory While I do not know anything about cog sci it is important to establish that an event is the basis for a human memory because it s memories you re trying to recreate not just simple sensory descriptions Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked Name Email Website

\\&#8221;After Life\\&#8221;.  The premise is that after you die, you can take one memory of your previous life with you to the next life, in the form of a video recording that recreates the memory you choose.  Though fiction, it details the process people go through to select and recreate a memory.  While I do not know anything about cog sci, it is important to establish that an event is the basis for a human memory, because it\\&#8217;s memories you\\&#8217;re trying to recreate, not just simple sensory descriptions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t</ol><!-- .commentlist -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"respond\" class=\"comment-respond\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3 id=\"reply-title\" class=\"comment-reply-title\">Leave a Reply <small><a rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"cancel-comment-reply-link\" href=\"/experiencing-past-events/#respond\" style=\"display:none;\">Cancel reply</a></small></h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<form action=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/wp-comments-post.php\" method=\"post\" id=\"commentform\" class=\"comment-form\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"comment-notes\"><span id=\"email-notes\">Your email address will not be published.</span> Required fields are marked <span class=\"required\">*</span></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"comment-form-author\"><label for=\"author\">Name <span class=\"required\">*</span></label> <input id=\"author\" name=\"author\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" size=\"30\" aria-required='true' /></p>\n<p class=\"comment-form-email\"><label for=\"email\">Email <span class=\"required\">*</span></label> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" size=\"30\" aria-describedby=\"email-notes\" aria-required='true' /></p>\n<p class=\"comment-form-url\"><label for=\"url\">Website</label> <input id=\"url\" name=\"url\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" size=\"30\" /></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"comment-form-comment\"><label for=\"comment\">Comment</label> <textarea id=\"comment\" name=\"comment\" cols=\"45\" rows=\"8\" aria-describedby=\"form-allowed-tags\" aria-required=\"true\"></textarea></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"form-allowed-tags\" id=\"form-allowed-tags\">You may use these <abbr title=\"HyperText Markup Language\">HTML</abbr> tags and attributes:  <code>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;abbr title=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;acronym title=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;cite&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;del datetime=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;q cite=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt; </code></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"form-submit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" class=\"submit\" value=\"Post Comment\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type='hidden' name='comment_post_ID' value='243' id='comment_post_ID' />\n<input type='hidden' name='comment_parent' id='comment_parent' value='0' />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</form>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- #respond -->\n\t\t\t\r\n</div><!-- #comments .comments-area -->\r\n\t\t</article>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</div><!-- #content --></div><!-- #primary -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"secondary\">\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n</div><!-- #secondary --></div><!-- #container -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t   </div><!-- #main -->\r\n\r\n\t   \r\n\t   \t\r\n\t   \r\n\t   <footer id=\"colophon\" class=\"clearfix\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"site-generator\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"container\"><div class=\"copyright\">Copyright &copy; 2015 <a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/\" title=\"Ramesh Jain\" ><span>Ramesh Jain</span></a> Theme by: <a href=\"http://themehorse.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Theme Horse\" ><span>Theme Horse</span></a> Powered by: <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WordPress\"><span>WordPress</span></a> </div><!-- .copyright --><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .container -->\r\n\t\t\t</div><!-- #site-generator --><div class=\"back-to-top\"><a href=\"#branding\">Back to Top</a></div>\t\t</footer>\r\n\t   \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t</div><!-- .wrapper -->\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "id": 49312.0}
