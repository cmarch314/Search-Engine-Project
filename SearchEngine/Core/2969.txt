pixel-based classifier for different body parts of a moving person. You will use the \"color\" images from the project video set. The classifier, constructed through Baye's rule, will classify a pixel \"x\" as foreground if P(x|foregound)P(foreground) > P(x|background)P(background). You will explore different likelihood models for P(x|foreground) and P(x|background) using multivariate Gaussians and histogram models. You will use these models to detect the torso, hair, and legs of the person moving in the video.\n\n    <p> <b> Overview: </b>   You will be given skeleton code <a href=\"hw2_skel.zip\">here</a>.
