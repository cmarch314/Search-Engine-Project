{"text": " SCHEDULE 1 Section 5 PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN THE NATIONAL STANDARD OF CANADA ENTITLED MODEL CODE FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN CSA Q83 96 4 1 Principle 1 Accountability An organization is responsible for personal information under its control and shall designate an individual or individuals who are accountable for the organization s compliance with the following principles 4 1 1 Accountability for the organization s compliance with the principles rests with the designated individual s even though other individuals within the organization may be responsible for the day to day collection and processing of personal information In addition other individuals within the organization may be delegated to act on behalf of the designated individual s 4 1 2 The identity of the individual s designated by the organization to oversee the organization s compliance with the principles shall be made known upon request 4 1 3 An organization is responsible for personal information in its possession or custody including information that has been transferred to a third party for processing The organization shall use contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being processed by a third party 4 1 4 Organizations shall implement policies and practices to give effect to the principles including a implementing procedures to protect personal information b establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries c training staff and communicating to staff information about the organization s policies and practices and d developing information to explain the organization s policies and procedures 4 2 Principle 2 Identifying Purposes The purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified by the organization at or before the time the information is collected 4 2 1 The organization shall document the purposes for which personal information is collected in order to comply with the Openness principle Clause 4 8 and the Individual Access principle Clause 4 9 4 2 2 Identifying the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time of collection allows organizations to determine the information they need to collect to fulfil these purposes The Limiting Collection principle Clause 4 4 requires an organization to collect only that information necessary for the purposes that have been identified 4 2 3 The identified purposes should be specified at or before the time of collection to the individual from whom the personal information is collected Depending upon the way in which the information is collected this can be done orally or in writing An application form for example may give notice of the purposes 4 2 4 When personal information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose not previously identified the new purpose shall be identified prior to use Unless the new purpose is required by law the consent of the individual is required before information can be used for that purpose For an elaboration on consent please refer to the Consent principle Clause 4 3 4 2 5 Persons collecting personal information should be able to explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected 4 2 6 This principle is linked closely to the Limiting Collection principle Clause 4 4 and the Limiting Use Disclosure and Retention principle Clause 4 5 4 3 Principle 3 Consent The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection use or disclosure of personal information except where inappropriate Note In certain circumstances personal information can be collected used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual For example legal medical or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent When information is being collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information Seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when the individual is a minor seriously ill or mentally incapacitated In addition organizations that do not have a direct relationship with the individual may not always be able to seek consent For example seeking consent may be impractical for a charity or a direct marketing firm that wishes to acquire a mailing list from another organization In such cases the organization providing the list would be expected to obtain consent before disclosing personal information 4 3 1 Consent is required for the collection of personal information and the subsequent use or disclosure of this information Typically an organization will seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection In certain circumstances consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use for example when an organization wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified 4 3 2 The principle requires knowledge and consent Organizations shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of the purposes for which the information will be used To make the consent meaningful the purposes must be stated in such a manner that the individual can reasonably understand how the information will be used or disclosed 4 3 3 An organization shall not as a condition of the supply of a product or service require an individual to consent to the collection use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfil the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes 4 3 4 The form of the consent sought by the organization may vary depending upon the circumstances and the type of information In determining the form of consent to use organizations shall take into account the sensitivity of the information Although some information for example medical records and income records is almost always considered to be sensitive any information can be sensitive depending on the context For example the names and addresses of subscribers to a newsmagazine would generally not be considered sensitive information However the names and addresses of subscribers to some special interest magazines might be considered sensitive 4 3 5 In obtaining consent the reasonable expectations of the individual are also relevant For example an individual buying a subscription to a magazine should reasonably expect that the organization in addition to using the individual s name and address for mailing and billing purposes would also contact the person to solicit the renewal of the subscription In this case the organization can assume that the individual s request constitutes consent for specific purposes On the other hand an individual would not reasonably expect that personal information given to a health care professional would be given to a company selling health care products unless consent were obtained Consent shall not be obtained through deception 4 3 6 The way in which an organization seeks consent may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of information collected An organization should generally seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive Implied consent would generally be appropriate when the information is less sensitive Consent can also be given by an authorized representative such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney 4 3 7 Individuals can give consent in many ways For example a an application form may be used to seek consent collect information and inform the individual of the use that will be made of the information By completing and signing the form the individual is giving consent to the collection and the specified uses b a checkoff box may be used to allow individuals to request that their names and addresses not be given to other organizations Individuals who do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of this information to third parties c consent may be given orally when information is collected over the telephone or d consent may be given at the time that individuals use a product or service 4 3 8 An individual may withdraw consent at any time subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice The organization shall inform the individual of the implications of such withdrawal 4 4 Principle 4 Limiting Collection The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by the organization Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means 4 4 1 Organizations shall not collect personal information indiscriminately Both the amount and the type of information collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfil the purposes identified Organizations shall specify the type of information collected as part of their information handling policies and practices in accordance with the Openness principle Clause 4 8 4 4 2 The requirement that personal information be collected by fair and lawful means is intended to prevent organizations from collecting information by misleading or deceiving individuals about the purpose for which information is being collected This requirement implies that consent with respect to collection must not be obtained through deception 4 4 3 This principle is linked closely to the Identifying Purposes principle Clause 4 2 and the Consent principle Clause 4 3 4 5 Principle 5 Limiting Use Disclosure and Retention Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected except with the consent of the individual or as required by law Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes 4 5 1 Organizations using personal information for a new purpose shall document this purpose see Clause 4 2 1 4 5 2 Organizations should develop guidelines and implement procedures with respect to the retention of personal information These guidelines should include minimum and maximum retention periods Personal information that has been used to make a decision about an individual shall be retained long enough to allow the individual access to the information after the decision has been made An organization may be subject to legislative requirements with respect to retention periods 4 5 3 Personal information that is no longer required to fulfil the identified purposes should be destroyed erased or made anonymous Organizations shall develop guidelines and implement procedures to govern the destruction of personal information 4 5 4 This principle is closely linked to the Consent principle Clause 4 3 the Identifying Purposes principle Clause 4 2 and the Individual Access principle Clause 4 9 4 6 Principle 6 Accuracy Personal information shall be as accurate complete and up to date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used 4 6 1 The extent to which personal information shall be accurate complete and up to date will depend upon the use of the information taking into account the interests of the individual Information shall be sufficiently accurate complete and up to date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate information may be used to make a decision about the individual 4 6 2 An organization shall not routinely update personal information unless such a process is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected 4 6 3 Personal information that is used on an ongoing basis including information that is disclosed to third parties should generally be accurate and up to date unless limits to the requirement for accuracy are clearly set out 4 7 Principle 7 Safeguards Personal information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information 4 7 1 The security safeguards shall protect personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access disclosure copying use or modification Organizations shall protect personal information regardless of the format in which it is held 4 7 2 The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information that has been collected the amount distribution and format of the information and the method of storage More sensitive information should be safeguarded by a higher level of protection The concept of sensitivity is discussed in Clause 4 3 4 4 7 3 The methods of protection should include a physical measures for example locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices b organizational measures for example security clearances and limiting access on a need to know basis and c technological measures for example the use of passwords and encryption 4 7 4 Organizations shall make their employees aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information 4 7 5 Care shall be used in the disposal or destruction of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information see Clause 4 5 3 4 8 Principle 8 Openness An organization shall make readily available to individuals specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal information 4 8 1 Organizations shall be open about their policies and practices with respect to the management of personal information Individuals shall be able to acquire information about an organization s policies and practices without unreasonable effort This information shall be made available in a form that is generally understandable 4 8 2 The information made available shall include a the name or title and the address of the person who is accountable for the organization s policies and practices and to whom complaints or inquiries can be forwarded b the means of gaining access to personal information held by the organization c a description of the type of personal information held by the organization including a general account of its use d a copy of any brochures or other information that explain the organization s policies standards or codes and e what personal information is made available to related organizations e g subsidiaries 4 8 3 An organization may make information on its policies and practices available in a variety of ways The method chosen depends on the nature of its business and other considerations For example an organization may choose to make brochures available in its place of business mail information to its customers provide online access or establish a toll free telephone number 4 9 Principle 9 Individual Access Upon request an individual shall be informed of the existence use and disclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to that information An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate Note In certain situations an organization may not be able to provide access to all the personal information it holds about an individual Exceptions to the access requirement should be limited and specific The reasons for denying access should be provided to the individual upon request Exceptions may include information that is prohibitively costly to provide information that contains references to other individuals information that cannot be disclosed for legal security or commercial proprietary reasons and information that is subject to solicitor client or litigation privilege 4 9 1 Upon request an organization shall inform an individual whether or not the organization holds personal information about the individual Organizations are encouraged to indicate the source of this information The organization shall allow the individual access to this information However the organization may choose to make sensitive medical information available through a medical practitioner In addition the organization shall provide an account of the use that has been made or is being made of this information and an account of the third parties to which it has been disclosed 4 9 2 An individual may be required to provide sufficient information to permit an organization to provide an account of the existence use and disclosure of personal information The information provided shall only be used for this purpose 4 9 3 In providing an account of third parties to which it has disclosed personal information about an individual an organization should attempt to be as specific as possible When it is not possible to provide a list of the organizations to which it has actually disclosed information about an individual the organization shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed information about the individual 4 9 4 An organization shall respond to an individual s request within a reasonable time and at minimal or no cost to the individual The requested information shall be provided or made available in a form that is generally understandable For example if the organization uses abbreviations or codes to record information an explanation shall be provided 4 9 5 When an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information the organization shall amend the information as required Depending upon the nature of the information challenged amendment involves the correction deletion or addition of information Where appropriate the amended information shall be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question 4 9 6 When a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual the substance of the unresolved challenge shall be recorded by the organization When appropriate the existence of the unresolved challenge shall be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question 4 1 Principle 1 Challenging Compliance An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization s compliance 4 1 1 The individual accountable for an organization s compliance is discussed in Clause 4 1 1 4 1 2 Organizations shall put procedures in place to receive and respond to complaints or inquiries about their policies and practices relating to the handling of personal information The complaint procedures should be easily accessible and simple to use 4 1 3 Organizations shall inform individuals who make inquiries or lodge complaints of the existence of relevant complaint procedures A range of these procedures may exist For example some regulatory bodies accept complaints about the personal information handling practices of the companies they regulate 4 1 4 An organization shall investigate all complaints If a complaint is found to be justified the organization shall take appropriate measures including if necessary amending its policies and practices ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/privacy/Canada-SCHEDULE.htm", "title": "bill c-54 -
