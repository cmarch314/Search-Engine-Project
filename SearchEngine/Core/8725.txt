It includes\r\nmany areas such as theorem-proving, game playing, propositional satis\fability, constraint \r\nsatisfaction, planning, scheduling, probabilistic inference and decision-making.\r\nThis dissertation is focused on reasoning in graphical frameworks such as constraint \r\nand belief networks, where domain knowledge is represented by a graph depicting \r\nvariables as nodes and dependencies (e.g., propositional clauses, constraints,\r\nprobabilities, and utilities) as edges. Some reasoning tasks can be formulated as\r\ncombinatorial optimization or constraint satisfaction problems, while others can be\r\nviewed as knowledge compilation, or inference. We approach those tasks using a\r\ngeneral graph-based algorithmic framework that combines a dynamic-programming\r\ntechnique called variable elimination with backtracking search, and investigate the\r\neffect of problem structure on the performance of such algorithms.\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r81-irina_thesis.ps\"><b>PostScript</b></a> |\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r81-irina_thesis.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8725.0}
