Various\nmethods \nfor reducing energy consumption have been investigated, both at the \ncircuit level and at the operating systems level. In this paper, we \npropose a simple model of job scheduling aimed at capturing some key \naspects of energy minimization. In this model, each job is to be \nexecuted between its arrival time and deadline by a single processor \nwith variable speed, under the assumption that energy usage per unit \ntime, <i>P</i>, is a convex function of the processor speed <i>s</i>. \nWe give an \noff-line algorithm that computes, for any set of jobs, a minimum-energy \nschedule. We then consider some on-line algorithms and their\ncompetitive \nperformance for the power function \n<i>P</i>(<i>s</i>) = <i>s <sup>p</sup></i>, where <i>p</i> is\ngreater than or equal to 2. It is \nshown that one natural heuristic, called the Average Rate Heuristic, \nuses at most a constant times the minimum energy required. The\nanalysis \ninvolves bounding the largest eigenvalue in matrices of a special\ntype.\n\n\n<p>\nFrom: \nFrances Yao, Alan J. Demers, Scott Shenker: A Scheduling Model for \nReduced CPU Energy.
