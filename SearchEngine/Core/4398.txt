This behavior unnecessarily taxes web \r\n      server resources, which are dedicated to a connection that ultimately does not \r\n      complete. While this is not as problematic at well-provisioned or \r\n      lightly-trafficked web servers, where all incoming requests can be serviced with \r\n      little or no queuing time required, such behavior is extremely detrimental to \r\n      poorly-provisioned or very busy web servers, where server deadlock may occur and \r\n      no users are adequately served.</p>\r\n      <p align=\"justify\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12\">In this work, we analytically derive, using queuing models, a service \r\n        ordering for web servers that is useful under these extreme conditions and that \r\n        takes into account the impatience of web users. The ordering is based on a \r\n        revenue generation model that assumes a web server earns some amount from \r\n        processing a user request to completion. This amount diminishes exponentially \r\n        with the time spent in queue and in service at the web server. In such cases, a \r\n        greedy algorithm maximizes server revenue and outperforms &quot;fair&quot; algorithms such \r\n        a first-in-first-out by several orders of magnitude when server load is high. \r\n        These performance gains continue even when the server passes into an overload \r\n        situation, allowing the web server to operate even when completely saturated. \r\n        These results are verified both analytically and via simulation, and have been \r\n        shown to be useful for general Markovian queuing systems as well.</p>\r\n      <blockquote>\r\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 12\"> <b><a href=\"http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/1033/\">An Optimal Service Ordering for a World \r\n          Wide Web Server</a></b> (with A.C.
