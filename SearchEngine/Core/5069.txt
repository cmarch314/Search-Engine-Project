In this example, e-mages corresponding to the term `iPhone' were\r\n<i>added</i> for 14 days. On the other hand, the AT&T retail store locations emage was <i>convolved</i> with the catchment area (assumed to\r\nbe a Gaussian Kernel) for each store. The difference between the obtained `aggregate interest' and `net catchment area' images was taken to\r\nbe a representative of the `under-served interest areas' where it makes sense to open a new retail store. To find out the best location for such a\r\nstore, we undertook a convolution operation between the catchment area of a new store and this `under-served interest areas' image. The\r\n<i>maxima</i> operation on the obtained image gave the most appropriate location. Note that the obtained answer in this case is not merely a pixel\r\nlocation but a physical geo-location with real life semantics.<br>\r\n<img src=\"../images/iPhone.png\" width=\"500px\" />\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 5069.0}
