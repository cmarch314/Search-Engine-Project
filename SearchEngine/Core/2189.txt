To clarify, your algorithms don't need to be perfect but there are some things that just shouldn't happen unless there's no other way to do it (e.g. Reading stop_words.txt multiple times instead of keeping it in a collection). <i>(Up to 5 points per deduction)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>The code isn't written following good programming practices (descriptive names, short methods, proper use of the language)? <i>(up to 5 points per deduction)</i></li>\n\t\t\t<li>The file has been modified after Saturday 11:59 pm. <i>(1% per hour up to 25% of the final score)</i></li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can notice, the maximum possible score is 100.
