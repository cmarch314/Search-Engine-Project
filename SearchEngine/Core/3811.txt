We\nshow that every algorithm enabled to access <i>A</i> during the query\nand using O(<i>N</i>/<i>c</i>) bits additional space requires\n&Omega;(<i>c</i>) query time, for any <i>c</i> where\n1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>c</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>N</i>. This lower bound\nholds for any dimension. In two dimensions, we complement the lower\nbound with an indexing data structure of size O(<i>N</i>/<i>c</i>) bits\nadditional space which can be preprocessed in O(<i>N</i>) time and\nachieves O(<i>c</i>&nbsp;log<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<i>c</i>) query\ntime. Taking <i>c</i> to be O(1), this is the first O(1) query time\nalgorithm using optimal O(<i>N</i>) bits additional space.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on a paper by Brodal, Davoodi, and Rao at ESA 2010.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3811.0}
