Professor of Computer Science has received a 6 grant from the National Science Foundation s CyberTrust program His project with co PI Cormac Flanagan from UC Santa Cruz will investigate next generation infrastructure for trustworthy web applications Many services traditionally performed by stand alone programs running on desktop computers are being migrated to Web 2 applications remote services that reside in the cloud and are that accessed through a browser This migration process offers a unique opportunity to re engineer the way that software is constructed adding some extra capabilities that reduce the vulnerability of the global information infrastructure to problems such as viruses cyber attacks loss of privacy and integrity violations With this goal in mind this project designs and implements a next generation infrastructure for trustworthy web applications It evolves the existing Web 2 technologies into a more trustworthy Web 2 Sec version by introducing information labeling and strong information flow controls pervasively at the service provider at the user s end and on all paths in between A key feature of the new Web 2 Sec architecture is that all application programs are executed on top of a virtual machine VM rather than directly on physical hardware Hence the VM retains full control over the data at all times allowing it to enforce information ow policies that guarantee con dentiality and integrity Even a malicious or faulty program running on top of the Web 2 Sec VM cannot cause any action that would violate these policies

Scott Jordan Professor of Computer Science Scott Jordan has received a 5 National Science Foundation grant to incorporate telecommunications policy and economics into the Internet architecture As a result of technical economic and public policy forces the Internet s original design principles layering and end to end are increasingly violated says Jordan Currently Internet Service Providers ISPs are deploying quality of service mechanisms but only allowing their use for certain applications sold to their own subscribers Some ISPs have used deep packet inspection techniques to implement traffic management practices that throttle or block peer to peer applications Professor Jordan hopes to counteract this deterioration by proposing an interdisciplinary approach that updates the Internet architectural principles to account for telecommunications policy and economics The project will identify the flaws of the end to end and layering models that are not withstanding the technical economic and legal forces upon networking The project aims to modify these models so that they promote good technical design respond appropriately to economic pressures and encourage societally beneficial outcomes To validate these new models Professor Jordan plans to illustrate their potential use by applying them to three case studies net neutrality traffic management and Quality of Service Professor Jordan is also developing an undergraduate course on The Internet and Public Policy This research will help bridge the gulf that exists between communication lawmakers and networking researchers by informing staff members in the United States Congress about the technical aspects of telecommunication issues and by developing an architectural framework for the networking research community to help them consider impacts of network economics and law Professor Jordan s research interests currently include pricing and differentiated services in the Internet resource allocation in wireless multimedia networks and telecommunications policy Franz Tsudik take part in National Cyber Leap Year Summit Michael Franz Gene Tsudik Professors of Computer Science Michael

environmental awareness Bill Tomlinson Bill Tomlinson professor of informatics has been awarded a 28 371 Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research EAGER for his project which will utilize narrative centered computing NCC to allow children to see how their own behavior can cause positive or negative changes in a story ecosystem Unlike traditional computational storytelling that utilizes a linear filmstrip NCC framework begins with a new mechanism for computational storytelling called spatiotemporal anchoring Spatiotemporally anchored stories consist of a network of story nodes in which each node depicts a small element of the overall plot and is anchored to a specific location in space and time To advance the story users explore a rich geographical representation of the relevant spatiotemporal locale discovering story nodes and the interconnections between them Because nodes can be anchored at variable levels of spatiotemporal resolution and interlinked in non linear ways exploring these narratives will help children to develop more nuanced abilities for reasoning about distributed causation and variable scale These abilities in turn will translate into more effective engagement with environmental issues The EAGER program is intended to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested but potentially transformative research ideas or approaches therefore the grant will go toward funding the creation of a testbed interactive narrative to be deployed online and as a temporary science museum exhibit This narrative will use spatiotemporal anchoring along with video and traditional cinematographic techniques to dramatize the interactions that take place within a representative California ecosystem for example a marine environment in which sea otters kelp forests and sea urchins all interact Tomlinson s research deals with the social impacts of information technologies in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive education systems His previous contributions to informatics and computer science are significant in human computer interaction interactive animation autonomous agents and multi device systems JUNE 2 9 Jarecki awarded

Professors Brett Sanders and Robin Keller have received a 38 grant from the Environment Institute at UC Irvine to support a new project entitled Using IT to Compress Perceived Time and Space in How People Think About Global Change A Step Towards Behavioral Change This interdisciplinary research collaboration is also being supported in part from a 1 contribution from the Urban Water Research Center at UC Irvine Sanders and Keller are respectively professors at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and The Paul Merage School of Business The research collaboration will study the difficulties people have in engaging with environmental issues in part because global change occurs on scales of time and space that are relatively large compared to the usual scope of human decision making People respond enthusiastically to fast acting disasters such as fires and earthquakes but less so to issues that occur more gradually over many years even when the consequences are far greater To date there has been little research on how to connect long term global environmental change to human scales of time and space in a systematic way thereby enabling behavioral change Tomlinson et al s research will focus on the science and public perception of sea level rise Tomlinson s research deals with the social impacts of information technologies in particular regarding environmental issues

Collaboration and Science Collaboratories GaryOlson Gary Olson Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences will give two keynote talks at the University of Siegen in Germany and the 2 9 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems Earlier this month Olson gave a keynote entitled Scientific Collaboration on the Internet at the conference on Enhancing Humanities Potentials of Media and ICT in the Humanities held at the University of Siegen in Germany In 1989 a small group of pioneering thinkers led by Joshua Lederberg and William Wulf sketched out a vision of what has come to be known by various names such as collaboratories eScience and cyberscience In the several decades since then many such projects have emerged in almost all areas of science But there has been a complex pattern of success and failure in such efforts Olson and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade studying these projects trying to figure out what accounts for the pattern of success and failure in them In his talk he reviewed lessons learned and where he hopes to go with further research in the area The current understanding from this investigation was recently summarized in a book entitled Scientific Collaboration on the Internet MIT Press 2 8 This week in Baltimore Olson will give a keynote entited The Next Generation of Science Collaboratories Olson will also talk about how the changing technical scene opens new opportunities for the next generation of collaboratories as well as the sociotechnical factors that distinguish successful from unsuccessful collaboratories Collaboratories to support scientific research have been around for at least two decades and have emerged as an important form of cyberinfrastructure to enable ever more ambitious geographically distributed research projects A broadened view of what a collaboratory is suggests there are a variety of kinds of functions they could support Early collaboratories were often rather narrow in focus but some have broadened to mimic fully functional laboratories Furthermore will almost all early collaboratories were in the physical and biological sciences by now they have emerged as serious research infrastructure in most domains including the social sciences and humanities Olson s latest research focuses on how to support small groups of people working on difficult intellectual tasks particularly when the members of the group are geographically distributed This research has involved both field studies of groups attempting to do such work and lab studies that evaluate specific technologies He is one of four Donald Bren Professors of Information and Computer Sciences at the Bren School Dourish in Taiwan for Service Science Workshop on Qualitative Field

Spatiotemporally anchored stories consist of a network of story nodes in which each node depicts a small element of the overall plot, and is anchored to a specific location in space and time. </p>\n<p>To advance the story users explore a rich geographical representation of the relevant spatiotemporal locale, discovering story nodes and the interconnections between them. Because nodes can be anchored at variable levels of spatiotemporal resolution and interlinked in non-linear ways, exploring these narratives will help children to develop more nuanced abilities for reasoning about distributed causation and variable scale. These abilities, in turn, will translate into more effective engagement with environmental issues.</p>\n<p>The EAGER program is intended to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches, therefore the grant will go toward funding the creation of a testbed interactive narrative, to be deployed online and as a temporary science museum exhibit. This narrative will use spatiotemporal anchoring along with video and traditional cinematographic techniques to dramatize the interactions that take place within a representative California ecosystem, for example, a marine environment in which sea otters, kelp forests, and sea urchins all interact. </p>\n<p>Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive education systems.

Tomlinson et al&#8217;s research will focus on the science and public perception of sea level rise. </p>\n<p>Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive\n                   education systems. His previous contributions to informatics and computer science are significant in human-computer interaction, interactive\n                   animation, autonomous agents, and multi-device systems. </p>\n<p>More about the Environment Institute at UC Irvine: <a href=\"http://environment.uci.edu/\">http://environment.uci.edu/</a> </p>\n<p>More about the Urban Water Research Center at UC Irvine: <a href=\"http://www.uwrc.uci.edu/\">http://www.uwrc.uci.edu/</a> </p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><a name=\"olson_collaboration_2009\"></a>Olson gives keynote talks on Scientific Collaboration and Science Collaboratories</strong></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"> <img alt=\"photo: Gary Olson\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/golson.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><strong>Gary<br/>Olson</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Gary Olson</strong>, Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences will give two keynote talks at the University of Siegen in\n                   Germany, and the 2009 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems. </p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Olson gave a keynote entitled \"Scientific Collaboration on the Internet\", at the conference on Enhancing Humanities:\n                   Potentials of Media and ICT in the Humanities, held at the University of Siegen in Germany. </p>\n<p>In 1989 a small group of pioneering thinkers, led by Joshua Lederberg and William Wulf, sketched out a vision of what has come to be known by\n                   various names, such as collaboratories, eScience, and cyberscience. </p>\n<p>In the several decades since then many such projects have emerged in almost all areas of science.  But there has been a complex pattern of\n                   success and failure in such efforts.  Olson and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade studying these projects, trying to figure out what\n                   accounts for the pattern of success and failure in them. In his talk he reviewed lessons learned, and where he hopes to go with further research\n                   in the area. </p>\n<p>The current understanding from this investigation was recently summarized in a book entitled \"Scientific Collaboration on the Internet\" (MIT\n                   Press, 2008). </p>\n<p>This week in Baltimore, Olson will give a keynote entited \"The Next Generation of Science Collaboratories\". Olson will also talk about how the\n                   changing technical scene opens new opportunities for the next generation of collaboratories, as well as the sociotechnical factors that\n                   distinguish successful from unsuccessful collaboratories. </p>\n<p>Collaboratories to support scientific research have been around for at least two decades, and have emerged as an important form of\n                   cyberinfrastructure to enable ever more ambitious geographically distributed research projects.  A broadened view of what a collaboratory is\n                   suggests there are a variety of kinds of functions they could support. </p>\n<p>Early collaboratories were often rather narrow in focus, but some have broadened to mimic fully-functional laboratories.  Furthermore, will\n                   almost all early collaboratories were in the physical and biological sciences, by now they have emerged as serious research infrastructure in\n                   most domains, including the social sciences and humanities. </p>\n<p>Olson&#8217;s latest research focuses on how to support small groups of people working on difficult intellectual tasks, particularly when the members\n                   of the group are geographically distributed.  This research has involved both field studies of groups attempting to do such work and lab studies\n                   that evaluate specific technologies.
