Unfortunately, developing a formal model for an on-going,\ncomplex process can be difficult, costly, and error prone.  This presents a\npractical barrier to the adoption of process technologies.  The barrier would\nbe lowered by automating the creation of formal models.  We are currently\nexploring techniques that can use basic event data captured from an on-going\nprocess to generate a formal model of process behavior.  We term this kind of\ndata analysis \"process discovery\".  This paper describes and illustrates\nthree methods with which we have been experimenting: algorithmic grammar\ninference, Markov models, and neural networks.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon May 22 17:49:31 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 26246.0}
