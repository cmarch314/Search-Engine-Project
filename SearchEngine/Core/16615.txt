Websites such as Gmail.com, Flickr.com and\r\nGoogle Docs are examples of such services. Current WDSs provide a\r\nvariety of data services that allow data storage, backup, sharing,\r\netc. These services have become so popular that they are now a part\r\nof our daily life. The biggest drawback of such services is the\r\nrequirement to  trust the service provider. Data outsourced is\r\nstored in plaintext and is vulnerable to outsider attacks from\r\nhackers/Internet thieves and insider attacks from malicious\r\nemployees. <br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\nTo combat the above issues, we propose DataProtector,  a security middleware for web based data services.\r\nDataProtector acts as a transparent middleman between the browser\r\nand the web server and enforces security requirements at the level\r\nof HTTP requests. DataProtector utilizes a rule based framework for\r\ndetermining the flow of sensitive information via HTTP\r\nrequests/responses and protects the confidentiality and integrity of\r\nsuch information using cryptographic techniques. DataProtector is a\r\ngeneric middleware that can protect data outsourced to a wide\r\nvariety of WDSs. We implemented a proof-of-concept DataProtector\r\nprototype to measure its performance. </p>  <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font size=3 color =\"red\"> Coming Soon </font> Full version of the DataProtector paper </p> \r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n", "id": 16615.0}
