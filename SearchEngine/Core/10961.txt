Zare answered the rest of your questions but I think not this one It s pretty similar to the 5 tetrahedron triangulation of the 3 cube Recall that that works by cutting off every other corner of the cube the remaining piece in the middle turns out to be a regular tetrahedron So let s try doing the same thing in four dimensions Cut off every other corner of a 4 cube The 4 cube has 16 corners so you cut off 8 simplices this way What s the shape of the piece left over in the middle It has 8 tetrahedral faces where you cut off a corner of the cube and some more faces subsets of the original faces of the cube you started with The 4 cube has 8 faces and after you cut the corners off these faces turn into regular tetrahedra So the left over piece has 16 regular tetrahedron faces It s one of the six regular 4 polytopes the 16 cell The 16 cell is easiest to visualize with the help of a Schlegel diagram form a regular tetrahedron in 3 space and nest inside it a regular tetrahedron in the opposite orientation so that each vertex of the inner tetrahedron is near the middle of a face of the outer tetrahedron think of the inner tetrahedron as being opaque and the outer one as being transparent and connect every pair of inner and outer vertices that can see each other Two of the faces of the 16 cell are the tetrahedra you started with Eight more are formed by connecting a face of one tetrahedron to a vertex of the other and the remaining six connect an edge of one tetrahedron to an edge of the other To finish the 4 cube s triangulation just connect one of the 16 cell s vertices with each of the opposite faces Each vertex is opposite 8 faces of the 16 cell because the other 8 faces touch the vertex as you can see from the Schlegel diagram So this step forms 8 more simplices which added to the 8 corners you cut off give a total of 16 It isn t so simple to extend this idea to higher dimensions E g if you cut off every other corner of a 5 cube you get a non regular polytope with 16 4 simplex faces and 1 16 cell faces David Eppstein UC Irvine Dept of Information Computer Science eppstein ics uci edu http www ics uci edu eppstein From David Eppstein

A short answer the product of a triangulation is simply the set of cells of the form simplex in one triangulation times simplex in the other Of course these cells are not themselves simplices for instance the product of a 1 simplex line segment and 2 simplex triangle is a triangular prism rather than a tetrahedron So you have to further subdivide the cells to get a triangulation again I m

The 4-cube has 16 corners,\nso you cut off 8 simplices this way.\n\nWhat's the shape of the piece left over in the middle?  It has 8\ntetrahedral faces (where you cut off a corner of the cube), and some\nmore faces (subsets of the original faces of the cube you started with).\nThe 4-cube has 8 faces, and after you cut the corners off these faces\nturn into regular tetrahedra.  So the left over piece has 16\nregular-tetrahedron faces.  It's one of the six regular 4-polytopes, the\n16-cell!\n\nThe 16-cell is easiest to visualize with the help of a Schlegel diagram:\nform a regular tetrahedron in 3-space, and nest inside it a regular\ntetrahedron in the opposite orientation (so that each vertex of the\ninner tetrahedron is near the middle of a face of the outer\ntetrahedron), think of the inner tetrahedron as being opaque and the\nouter one as being transparent, and connect every pair of inner and\nouter vertices that can see each other.  Two of the faces of the 16-cell\nare the tetrahedra you started with.  Eight more are formed by\nconnecting a face of one tetrahedron to a vertex of the other, and the\nremaining six connect an edge of one tetrahedron to an edge of the\nother.\n\nTo finish the 4-cube's triangulation, just connect one of the 16-cell's\nvertices with each of the opposite faces.  Each vertex is opposite 8\nfaces of the 16-cell (because the other 8 faces touch the vertex, as you\ncan see from the Schlegel diagram).  So this step forms 8 more\nsimplices, which added to the 8 corners you cut off give a total of 16.\n\nIt isn't so simple to extend this idea to higher dimensions.  E.g., if\nyou cut off every other corner of a 5-cube, you get a non-regular\npolytope, with 16 4-simplex faces and 10 16-cell faces.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             John Kasdan &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:kasdan@columbia.edu\">kasdan@columbia.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Triangulation of cubes\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 6 Jan 1999 09:40:25 -0800 (PST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nJohn Kasdan writes:\n &gt; He may well have, but my newfeed hasn't gotten it yet.  Are you sure\n &gt; he posted it and didn't just mail it to you?  In any case, I would\n &gt; still like a description, or at least a reference, to \"the cartesian\n &gt; product of a triangulation\" if it wouldn't be too much trouble.\n\nA short answer: the product of a triangulation is simply the set of cells\nof the form (simplex in one triangulation) times (simplex in the other).\nOf course, these cells are not themselves simplices, for instance the\nproduct of a 1-simplex(=line segment) and 2-simplex(=triangle) is a\ntriangular prism rather than a tetrahedron.  So, you have to\nfurther subdivide the cells to get a triangulation again.\n\nI'm including a copy of Zare's message again for you below.\n\nOne other reference on this sort of subject (products of triangulations,\nthat is, not so much cube triangulation) is my own paper,\n\"Dihedral bounds for mesh generation in high dimensions\",\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/BerCheEpp-SODA-95.pdf\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/BerCheEpp-SODA-95.pdf</A>\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:zare@cco.caltech.edu\">zare@cco.caltech.edu</A> (Douglas J.

The author gives an elegant way of triangulating the\ncube $I\\sp {kn}$ once a triangulation of $I\\sp n$ is\nknown.
