It\nis possible to map such a sequence to a stream of bytes and present\nthe result to a general purpose compression algorithm, such as gzip,\nbut the results are disappointing.\n<p>\nHowever, if we introduce the assumption that an integer's frequency is\napproximately inversely proportional to its magnitude, it becomes\npossible to encode integers efficiently.  This talk will introduce one\nmotivation for integer coding: the lossless compression of digitized\naudio.  Then it will proceed to paraphrase a 1996 paper by Peter\nFenwick that summarizes several methods of integer coding, and\npresents an experimental comparison of their effectiveness.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 1694.0}
