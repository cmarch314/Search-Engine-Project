triangles within a constant of optimal this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh element quality and mesh complexity of this form and therefore the first to provide finite

triangulate planar point sets so that all angles are non obtuse using linearly many triangles and to triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and a number of simplices within a constant of optimal Also we can augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation has linear complexity In later follow up work I showed that the same technique can also

We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm\nfor the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to\nsplit in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the\nother augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries\nand merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented\nmodel. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary\nexperimental results.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"http://www.graphics.ics.uci.edu/publications/BDEG05\">Graphics\nlab pubs page</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Happy endings for flip graphs.</b><br>\nD.

Point sets of this type include\nconvex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other\ninfinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets\ncan be computed efficiently.\n<p>\n<li><b>Approximate Topological Matching of Quadrilateral Meshes</b>.<br>\nD.
