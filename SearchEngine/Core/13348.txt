no hyperplane through the centerpoint partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset Center points have been used by Teng and others as a key step in the construction of geometric separators One can find a point with this property by choosing a random sample of the collection and applying linear programming but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the
