These abstractions attempt to do two things. One is to\ncreate a metaphorical high-level representation, building anaologies\nto other domains of experience. The second is to hide implementation\ndetails, which are the mechanism by which the abstraction is\nmaintained. We believe that metaphorical representations are\ncritically important for interaction, but that information hiding is\nproblematic. By hiding the detail of how the computer will respond and\nreact to user requests and tasks, conventional abstractions and\nmetaphors make it harder, not easier, for people to coordinate their\nactions and use computer systems. We are exploring a range of\napproaches that give users a stronger sense of how computer systems\nwork.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs a starting point, we wanted to investigate what kinds of visual\nrepresentations we might be able to provide of running software\nsystems. Focussing initially on novice programmers, we build an\nextension to the Java Virtual Machine which we call Vavoom, or the\nVisual Virtual Machine. Vavoom builds real-time visual depictions of\nthe behavior of unmodified Java class files. These visual\nrepresentations can be dynamically explored by programmers to get a\nbetter picture of what is going on inside the software systems that\nthey are writing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSample images showing different views:\n<center>\n<a href=vavoom1.jpg><img border=0 src=vavoom1-small.jpg></a>\n<a href=vavoom2.jpg><img border=0 src=vavoom2-small.jpg></a>\n<a href=vavoom3.jpg><img border=0 src=vavoom3-small.jpg></a>\n</center>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can read a paper about Vavoom\n<a href=ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/~jpd/papers/2002/viscomp-vavoom.pdf>here</a>.\nThis work has been carried out with Johan Byttner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=../research.shtml>Back to Research Overview</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n", "id": 9874.0}
