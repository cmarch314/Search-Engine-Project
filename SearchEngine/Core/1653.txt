The robots are anonymous in the sense that they all execute the\nsame algorithm and they cannot be distinguished by their appearances.\nInitially they do not have a common x-y coordinate system. Such a system\ncan be viewed as a distributed system of anonymous mobile processes in\nwhich the processes (i.e., robots) can \"communicate\" with each other only\nby means of their moves. In this paper we investigate a number of\nformation problems of geometric patterns in the plane by the robots.\nSpecifically, we present algorithms for converging the robots to a single\npoint and moving the robots to a single point in finite steps. We also\ncharacterize the class of geometric patterns that the robots can form in\nterms of their initial configuration. Some impossibility results are also\npresented.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 1653.0}
