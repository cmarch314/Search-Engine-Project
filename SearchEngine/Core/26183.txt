are becoming increasingly a tool for the overall protection of fundamental human rights thereby adding significantly to the conventional privacy framework The recent Italian Data Protection Act no 675 of 31 12 1996 regards privacy protection as a part of a larger whole taking also account of guidelines already included in the European Directive of 1995 indeed personal data are to be processed by respecting the rights fundamental freedoms and dignity of natural persons in particular with regard to privacy and personal identity Thus privacy becomes a fundamental component of the electronic citizenship which will be a basic features of the next millennium This ambitious target cannot be achieved solely through an Act ensuring a high level of protection to citizens powerful social legitimation is also required The level of protection ensured by the Italian Act is considerable This is partly due to the fact that Parliament chose to include from the very beginning significant provisions of the EU Directive into domestic legislation hence the protection of personal data processed in Italy is at least currently in many instances greater than that ensured by countries in which this is long standing practice Social legitimation also results from the fact that the supervisory authority is direct exclusive expression of Parliamentary activity The four members of the Supervisory Authority i e the Garante for Personal Data Protection are elected by both Houses and the chairman is in turn elected by the members This means that no undue pressure 1s exercised by Government which obviously enhances the independence of the authority Further being directly linked to popular sovereignty through the election by Parliament the authority is especially qualified to carry out activities which are aimed firstly and above all at protecting values and fundamental rights to which all citizens are entitled Thus the Garante is not entrusted exclusively with the task of monitoring or auditing data hanks in fact it has considerable power of action including data hanks to which no supervision usually applies see Article 4 This is the case for instance of intelligence services which may not dismiss the requests made by the Garante on grounds of State secrecy as is often the case in respect of similar requests made by judicial authorities The Garante is also committed the difficult task of striking a balance between diverging interests This is apparent as regards the relationships between privacy and freedom of the press hut also applies to other matters such as sensitive data processing of such data is allowed only with the data subject s consent and with the authorization by the Garante Act no 675 is accompanied by another Act no 676 which provides flexibility and can be said to be a gateway to the future Self amendment arrangements are provided for based on the experience gained in the implementation of the Act the Government may issue decrees supplementing and or amending the Act so as to bring the latter fully into line with actual requirements Two such decrees have already been issued Furthermore the Government was enabled to issue by the end of 1998 a number of decrees which should allow supplementing the existing legislation in especially complex areas or in sectors showing innovations due to the development of information and communication technology This entails the commitment towards laying down provisions applying to the whole issue of telematics networks by the term stated which will prevent leaving out the very sectors in which the protection of fundamental human rights is especially necessary and involves a greater effort IL GARANTE Table of Contents Chapter I GENERAL PRINCIPLES Chapter II OBLIGATIONS

ALIGN=\"CENTER\">FOREWORD</P>\n</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"></P>\n</B></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Personal data \nlaws are becoming increasingly a tool for the overall protection of \nfundamental human rights, thereby adding significantly to the \nconventional privacy framework. The recent Italian Data Protection \nAct (no. 675 of 31.12.1996) regards privacy protection as a part of a \nlarger whole-taking also account of guidelines already included in \nthe European Directive of 1995: indeed, personal data are to be \nprocessed \"by respecting the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity \nof natural persons, in particular with regard to privacy and personal \nidentity\". Thus, privacy becomes a fundamental component of the \n\"electronic citizenship\" which will be a basic features of the next \nmillennium.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This ambitious target cannot be achieved solely \nthrough an Act ensuring a high level of protection to citizens: \npowerful social legitimation is also required.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The level of protection ensured by the Italian Act \nis considerable. This is partly due to the fact that Parliament chose \nto include, from the very beginning, significant provisions of the EU \nDirective into domestic legislation; hence, the protection of \npersonal data processed in Italy is, at least currently, in many \ninstances greater than that ensured by countries in which this is \nlong-standing practice.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Social legitimation also results from the fact \nthat the supervisory authority is direct, exclusive expression of \nParliamentary activity. The four members of the Supervisory Authority \n(i.e., the \"Garante\") for Personal Data Protection are elected by \nboth Houses, and the chairman is, in turn, elected by the members. \nThis means that no undue pressure 1s exercised by Government, which \nobviously enhances the independence of the authority. Further, being \ndirectly linked to popular sovereignty - through the election by \nParliament - the authority is especially qualified to carry out \nactivities which are aimed, firstly and above all, at protecting \nvalues and fundamental rights to which all citizens are entitled.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Thus, the Garante is not entrusted exclusively \nwith the task of monitoring or auditing data hanks: in fact, it has \nconsiderable power of action, including data hanks to which no \nsupervision usually applies (see Article 4). This is the case, for \ninstance, of intelligence services, which may not dismiss the \nrequests made by the Garante on grounds of State secrecy - as is \noften the case in respect of similar requests made by judicial \nauthorities.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Garante is also committed the difficult task \nof striking a balance between diverging interests. This is apparent \nas regards the relationships between privacy and freedom of the \npress, hut also applies to other matters - such as sensitive data; \nprocessing of such data is allowed only with the data subject's \nconsent <U>and</U> with the authorization by the Garante.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Act no. 675 is accompanied by another Act (no. \n676) which provides flexibility and can be said to be a gateway to \nthe future. Self-amendment arrangements are provided for: based on \nthe experience gained in the implementation of the Act, the \nGovernment may issue decrees supplementing and/or amending the Act so \nas to bring the latter fully into line with actual requirements. Two \nsuch decrees have already been issued. Furthermore, the Government \nwas enabled to issue, by the end of 1998, a number of decrees which \nshould allow supplementing the existing legislation in especially \ncomplex areas or in sectors showing innovations due to the \ndevelopment of information and communication technology. This entails \nthe commitment towards laying down provisions applying to the whole \nissue of telematics networks by the term stated - which will prevent \nleaving out the very sectors in which the protection of fundamental \nhuman rights is especially necessary and involves a greater \neffort.</P>\n</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"right\">IL GARANTE \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\n</FONT><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">&nbsp;</P>\n<FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><B>Table of Contents</B></P>\n</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter I&nbsp;&nbsp; - GENERAL PRINCIPLES</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter II&nbsp; - OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE \nCONTROLLER</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter III&nbsp;- PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</P>\n<DIR>\n<DIR>\n\n</FONT><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part I - Collection and quality of personal data</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part II - Data subject&#146;s rights in respect of \ndata processing</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part III - Security in data processing, \nlimitations on the</P><DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">utilization of data and payment of damages</P></DIR>\n\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part IV - Communication and dissemination of data</P>\n<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P></DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter IV&nbsp;&nbsp;- PROCESSING OF SPECIAL \nCATEGORIES OF DATA</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- PROCESSING SUBJECT \nTO SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter VI&nbsp;&nbsp;- ADMINISTRATIVE AND \nJUDICIAL REMEDIES</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter VII&nbsp; - SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter VIII - PENALTIES</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter IX&nbsp;&nbsp;- TRANSITIONAL, FINAL AND \nREPEALED PROVISIONS</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P></DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter X&nbsp;&nbsp; - FUNDING AND ENTRY INTO FORCE</P>\n</FONT><B><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">&nbsp;</P>\n\n<P></B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">CHAPTER I</P>\n<P><B><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</P><BR>\n<P><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Article 1<BR>\n(</B><I>Purposes and definitions</I><B>)</P>\n<P></B><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><B>1</B>.
