His surname was different than that of his father, <a href=\"langsam/homelang.htm\">Pesach Langsam</a>, possibly because he was the oldest child and not living at home when the family adopted the surname of Langsam.\n\tBy the 1860's his family was well dispersed throughout much of Eastern Europe. By 1900 there were Millers from this family in Western Europe, North America, Asia, and \n\tAfrica. Today his descendants live on six continents.<p>\n\tClick on the image of the tree <img src=\"img/smaltree.gif\" width=18 height=17 border=0> from any page to return to the homepage.<BR><BR>\n\t<B>Please note: Many family members bear spelling variations of the name Miller.
