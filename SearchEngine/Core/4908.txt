This system fits a\nprobabilistic model of the arm to sequences of images taken\nfrom multiple angles. The arm model defines shapes and colors\nof limbs and limb configurations that are more or less likely.\nWe demonstrate that the system is 1) robust to cluttered scenes\nand temporary occlusions; 2) accurate relative to a commercial\nmotion capture device; and 3) capable of capturing kinematics\nthat correlate with concurrent measures of post stroke limb\nfunction. To evaluate the PB system, the functional motion of\n7 stroke survivors was measured concurrently with the PB\nsystem and a commercial motion capture system. In addition,\nfunctional motion was assessed by an expert using the Fugl-\nMeyer Assessment (FMA) and related to recorded kinematics.\nStandard deviation of differences in measured elbow angles\nbetween systems was 5.7 degrees; deviation in hand velocity\nestimates was 2.6 cm/s. Several statistics, moreover, correlated\nstrongly with FMA scores. Standard deviation in shoulder velocity\nhad a significant correlation coefficient with FMA score\nbelow -0.75 when measured with all systems.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/AllinBER_NSRE_2010/AllinBER_NSRE_2010.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nSonya Allin, Nancy Baker, Emily Eckel, and Deva Ramanan.\nRobust tracking of the upper limb for functional stroke assessment.\nIn <em>IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering (NSRE)</em>. 2010.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@inproceedings{<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AllinBER_NSRE_2010,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Allin, Sonya and Baker, Nancy and Eckel, Emily and Ramanan, Deva\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"Robust Tracking of the Upper Limb for Functional Stroke Assessment\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2010\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering (NSRE)\"<br>\n}<br>\n<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2015 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4908.0}
