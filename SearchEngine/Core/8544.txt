The main virtue of this representation\r\nis its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which can\r\ntranslate into exponential time savings for search algorithms.\r\nAND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB) is a new algorithm that\r\nexplores the AND/OR search tree for solving optimization\r\ntasks in graphical models. In this paper we extend the algorithm\r\nto explore an AND/OR search graph by equipping\r\nit with a context-based adaptive caching scheme similar to\r\ngood and no-good recording. The efficiency of the new graph\r\nsearch algorithm is demonstrated empirically on the very\r\nchallenging benchmarks that arise in genetic linkage analysis.\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r128.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8544.0}
