Through the use of various parallel\nprocessing techniques, some of which are available at UCI, you may be\nable to reduce your processing time to a tolerable length.  This talk\nisn't meant to dive into anything theoretically intense, but is mostly\nto give an introduction and a bit of background to those who have had\nlittle exposure to parallel processing and what it entails.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 1082.0}
