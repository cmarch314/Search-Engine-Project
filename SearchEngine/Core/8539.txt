We present distributed algorithms and show that, in the JTMS framework,\r\nboth belief revision and consistency maintenance are linear in the size of the \r\nknowledgebase on singly connected structures. However, the ATMS task is exponential in the\r\nbranching degree of the network. The singly-connected model, while restrictive, is useful\r\nfor three reasons. First, efficient algorithms on singly-connected models can be utilized\r\nin more general structures by employing well-known clustering techniques. Second, these\r\nalgorithms can serve as approximations or as heuristics in algorithms that perform \r\ntruth-maintenance on general problems. Finally, the analysis provides insights for \r\nunderstanding the sources of the computational difficulties associated with JTMS and ATMS.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r52-struct-algrthms-truth-mainten.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r52-struct-algrthms-truth-mainten.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8539.0}
