Compared to other dynamical methods, our approach requires\nminimal information about the mathematical structure of the ODE; it does not use qualitative descriptions of\ninteractions within the network; and it employs new statistics to protect against over-fitting. It generates spatio-\ntemporal maps of factor activity, highlighting the times and spatial locations at which different regulators might\naffect target gene expression levels. We identify an ODE model for eve mRNA pattern formation in the Drosophila\nmelanogaster blastoderm and show that this reproduces the experimental patterns well. Compared to a non-\ndynamic, spatial-correlation model, our ODE gives 59% better agreement to the experimentally measured pattern.\nOur model suggests that protein factors frequently have the potential to behave as both an activator and inhibitor\nfor the same cis-regulatory module depending on the factors' concentration, and implies different modes of\nactivation and repression.<p>\n\nConclusions: Our method provides an objective quantification of the regulatory potential of transcription factors in\na network, is suitable for both low- and moderate-dimensional gene expression datasets, and includes\nimprovements over existing dynamic and static models.\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/Aswani_BMCB_2010/Aswani_BMCB_2010.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nAnil Aswani, Soile Ker\u00e4en, James Brown, Charless&nbsp;C.
