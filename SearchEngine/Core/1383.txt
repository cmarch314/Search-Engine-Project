Faraway So Close Project 2 Letter Never SentProject 3 Maps and LegendsProject 4 People Just Love to Play with Words Introduction This quarter much of your focus will be on the programming projects found here Being a course in C programming all of these projects will be written entirely in C they are designed to expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques that are important in C and to prepare you for later coursework in ICS such as ICS 46 I do not assume that any of you will have previous C experience though I do expect that all of you have at least a year or so of introductory programming experience in some language other than C For a lot of you that will have been our first year sequence in Python others will have taken our previous first year sequence in Java or introductory courses in other places in any of a variety of programming languages In general if you have some experience programming in something equivalent in depth to what you might have learned in our first year courses you ll be fine provided that you re willing to put in the time and effort to learn something new especially something that might look and feel quite different from what you re accustomed to Your most important focus when learning a new programming language is forming an understanding of the appropriate idioms the new language provides as opposed to attempting a line for line translation from the language you prefer to the language you re learning different programming languages encourage you to think differently about programming problems and you might find C to be a big departure from what you ve seen before but big departures are how you grow your knowledge and ability Note that C programming requires a level of care and attention to detail that exceeds what you may have experienced in languages you ve used previously requiring a dual focus on both higher level abstractions and lower level implementation details that many languages hide and or handle automatically Focusing on the small details of the code you write is more important than it is in many other languages Debugging can be more of an adventure given that program crashes will not necessarily be accompanied with the clarity of diagnostics to which you ve become accustomed For these reasons it s important to start your work early encounter problems early and get questions asked and answered early Many of the most perplexing debugging problems I ve ever faced in my professional career were in C programs and having enough time to get these kinds of issues resolved may well be the difference between finishing your work or not While prior C or C experience is neither required nor assumed it doesn t hurt however if you have prior experience especially in C you may find that some of the practices you ve learned in the past are not acceptable in this course We re focused not just on writing programs that generate the correct output but at least as importantly on techniques that modularize programs manage and hide complexity and generally make the best use of what C has to offer above and beyond what is provided by its C heritage It s important to realize that while C and C share a common lineage they have diverged in a number of ways in the last couple of decades be aware that our focus here is squarely on C not C We ll start with some of the baseline concepts first and ignore a lot of the higher level abstractions but will quickly realize that writing clear C programs requires avoiding the manual error prone techniques as often as possible so we ll gradually learn techniques to automate them or render them unnecessary Evaluation of your work Evaluation criteria Each of your projects will be graded on a 3 point scale with the points split albeit unevenly into two categories correctness and robustness i e does the program work and quality and design i e how well is the program written They are described in more detail below CriteriaValueDescriptionCorrectness and robustness2 points Summary Does the program do what it s supposed to do for any input that meets the project specifications When the program is given valid input does it generate the output specified Is the output spacing and case correct if these are specified When the program is given unusual or erroneous input and the project write up doesn t specifically forbid us from testing it is it handled gracefully Are all resources allocated by the program e g memory open files released before the program ends Quality and design1 points Summary Strive to write a clear well organized readable modifiable program Your program should be divided into logical parts each encapsulating a single task or idea Large functions or classes should be broken up into smaller ones that do simpler jobs Identifier names should be chosen to reflect their objective the names should be meaningful to the reader Comments should be included where necessary to introduce clarity for the reader though it should be noted that good modularity and well named identifiers make the commenting burden significantly lighter Any other rules and or limitations specified in the project write up should have been followed TOTAL3 points Code that does not compile If you submit a program that does not compile we will not be able to execute it and thus will not be able to evaluate its correctness It is your responsibility to turn in code that compiles and it s important that it compiles in the development environment specified for this course more about that below Though we will make an honest effort to assess its overall correctness and quality we can at our discretion assign a score as low as zero to a program that does not compile and you can assume that your score on such a program will not necessarily apporach the percentage of completeness and correctness you actually achieved as it is impossible for us to measure that without being able to run and test your program At the level of experience that is assumed of you you should be able to ensure that code compiles even in a partially completed program you should be able to work incrementally save copies when you reach stable state and so on You might also consider using a source control tool like Git which helps you to formalize this kind of incremental work though this is not required If you ve never used a source control tool before it would be worth the effort spent to learn about one given its flexibility and popularity in professional and open source circles Git is a very good choice If you prefer something else feel free to use it Git is installed on the ICS 45C VM but you can install other systems on to the VM pretty easily if you prefer something else Re evaluation of your work As projects are graded you will receive scores and feedback on each in an email from your TA If you believe that you ve been graded unfairly your first move is to contact your TA and discuss the issue with him or her directly as your TA is more familiar with the details of the grading of your work than I would be the first thing I usually do is to contact the TA anyway Most issues are resolved this way Note that we do not reconsider the rubric used to grade your work afterward but if it was applied unfairly or incorrectly we can consider an adjustment If after this you still believe that you haven t been treated fairly you are welcome to raise the issue with me and I can arbitrate though I should point out that it is relatively rare that I overrule a TA s judgment I ve communicated a fair amount with the TAs about grading ahead of time so they re generally acting on my instructions so I don t find very often that I think a TA has graded work unfairly Late work Things happen and ten week quarters can be unforgiving It s not unreasonable to expect that you may find it difficult to finish one of the projects on time even if you re on top of things most of the time I get emails often from students saying things like If I just had one more day to work on this I d get it done On the other hand being consistently behind is a recipe for struggle in this course we ll be moving quickly and it will be progressively harder to catch up the farther behind you get The best balance between these two realities is that everyone is allowed to have a tough time with a project once this quarter with no penalty maybe you underestimated the difficulty of an assignment maybe you have three midterms and a paper due the same day maybe you have a sudden outside commitment that can t be avoided However we generally require to keep up with the due dates as assigned and we do generally assign a penalty for work submitted late Submitting late work Aside from the one time late submission described below late work is accepted according to the following policy You may submit late work subject to a penalty of 1 of your final score per hour beyond the deadline Full or partial hours are counted So for example a project submitted at 3 15am the morning after an 11 59pm deadline would be subject to a 4 penalty because it was submitted 3 1 4 hours late i e three full hours plus a partial one In that example if your score on the project would have been 27 3 ordinarily it will be reduced by 4 and become 25 92 3 instead The one time late submission To accommodate the occasional unforeseen issue we do also allow a one time late submission Each student is permitted to submit any one project up to 48 hours late with no penalty with no questions asked about why and no prior notification required For the purposes of clarification here are some additional details about how this policy works You are not required to notify us in advance in fact in all honesty we d prefer that you didn t There are a lot of students in this course so that would represent a lot of extra work for us We ll be looking for submissions beyond the deadline of each project so yours won t be lost in the shuffle There is a ten minute grace period after the due date allowing you time to get your files submitted to Checkmate If you submitted your files at 12 8am for an 11 59pm due date you re fine Best not to play with fire though if you re already done before 11 59pm at 12 11am you ll have used up your one time extension No exceptions If any one file is submitted beyond the ten minute grace period the entire project is considered late and falls under the late work policy If you submit more than one project late this quarter we will automatically determine the best possible outcome for you so that you get the maximum benefit from this policy For example Suppose you submit Project 1 five hours late and your score would have been 1 3 Suppose you submit Project 2 two hours late and your score would have been 3 3 before taking lateness into account The late penalty on Project 1 would be 5 of 1 points or 5 points The late penalty on Project 2 would be 2 of 3 points or 6 points Given these numbers we will apply the one time exception to Project 2 since it will provide you the most benefit 6 points instead of 5 In general this procedure is automatic and does not require negotiation or notification we will apply this consistently to everyone The goal is that this should accommodate the unforeseen issues that might otherwise prevent you from finishing a project on time while freeing course staff to focus on other things What to do if you re chronically late Out of the ordinary circumstances sometimes warrant exceptions to this policy if you are faced with a problem that is preventing you from getting your work done on time either on a single assignment or chronically please contact me and we can talk about how best to approach the problem It s important to contact me sooner rather than later earlier in the quarter there are a lot more things I can do to help than there are in the tenth week or after the final course grades are determined Development environment Unlike programming languages such as Java or Python which make it a point to be more or less independent of the platform i e the hardware the operating system etc that they run on C is decidedly platform dependent This is especially true in the recent years as two new versions of the C Standard called C 11 and C 14 have been completed but not all compiler implementers have implemented all of the new features of the language yet and library support is even more hit or miss And even amongst the features that all compilers share there are differences all the way down to details such as the maximum value you can store in a variable of type int that make it important for us to agree on a single development environment a particular compiler running on a particular operating system Because not every one of you will be running the same operating system on your own machine and to avoid the problem of having each of you install and configure the necessary software yourselves the officially supported development environment for ICS 45C is provided in the form of a virtual machine a complete environment that includes an operating system compiler debugger text editors and so on we ll call this the ICS 45C VM Rather than installing software you ll download the ICS 45C VM and run it as an application on your computer but log into it as though it was a separate computer This is explained in more detail in Project which describes how to download it and set it up for use What if I don t want to use the ICS 45C VM Everything we do this quarter will be standard C 14 Aside from incompatibilities between compilers both those arising from new features that are implemented by some compilers and not others as well as platform dependencies I would expect you to be in good shape using something else a large percentage of the time though you ll find that you hit bumps in the road sometimes and it may not be obvious when you do You may write programs that work in your environment but don t work in the provided environment this is a realistic possibility in C especially when we re working with newer language features that aren t implemented in every compiler Be aware that we will be grading your work using the ICS 45C VM so at minimum you should always test your projects in the ICS 45C VM before submitting your work Submitting work that compiles on your favorite compiler but not in the ICS 45C VM is viewed the same as any other work that does not compile at all as when you work for or with someone else professionally you don t always get to choose your favorite environment to work and have to adapt to what is appropriate to the situation Additionally be aware that you re on your own to get software other than the ICS 45C VM set up and configured we can t realistically support everyone s separate home installation whereas the ICS 45C VM gives us a single system to support Also and especially if you ve never used Linux before or spent a lot of time on a command line you should consider the practical usefulness of learning new skills that will no doubt prove to be valuable as you pursue professional and academic options further down the line Trying out something new while having the safety net of a large course staff to help you is a lot better than struggling with it on your own Even if only for that reason I d strongly encourage you to use the ICS 45C VM for all of your work even if it seems like a difficult transition at first Linux and command lines are an important part of real world computing and you would be wise to gain some experience with them Submitting your projects When you complete each project you must submit it to us electronically to a web based system called Checkmate Follow this link for a detailed description of how to submit your projects via Checkmate Understand that we will only accept projects submitted using the procedure described there we do not accept printed copies of your projects nor do we accept them via email under any circumstances You are responsible for submitting the version of your project that you want graded We will grade the most recent submission made before the deadline Accidentally submitting the wrong version will not be considered grounds for a regrade Academic honesty The policy As ICS 45C or CSE 45C students you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole Please take a few minutes to read the policies which can be found at this link All of your lab work is expected to be completed solely by you Worker in larger groups and or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted Note that high level discussion of course material for better understanding is permitted and encouraged but when it comes time to sit down and write code that is expected to be done by you and you alone All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions even when there are superficial differences Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in or even refer to code written by a friend of yours who took the course already Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else s work Academic honesty is a two way street Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted anymore than turning in someone else s code Resist the temptation to give code to your friends for reference Based on my experience I can say that your friends may very well betray you and turn it in anyway Naturally the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors registering for computing minors joining the ICS Honors Program and graduating from a computing major with honors The lesson Okay so the moral of the story is that it s wise to avoid cheating I believe that it s relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it why come to UCI if you re not planning to get something out of the coursework So why do people cheat every quarter in every course The answers vary but here s the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I ve had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years I fell behind and couldn t figure out how to catch up Things happen and ten week quarters are unforgiving You might get sick you might have issues crop up in your family you might have an off campus job that s demanding too much of your time you might be trying to decide whether you re on the path you want to be on Any of those things and many others can make it hard to keep up You fall a little behind you fall a little further behind and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless You re under pressure temptation gets the better of you If you feel like you re beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control the best thing to do is to talk to us sooner rather than later We re here to help we understand But the reality of taking large sized courses at a large sized institution is that we re not going to know you re in need unless you tell us If things are happening in your life tell us you don t have to be specific if you re not comfortable with it Before the fact there s often a way to work things out After the fact it s usually too late Late work policy updated and clarified by Alex Thornton Fall 2

class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Introduction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This quarter, much of your focus will be on the programming projects found here.  Being a course in C++ programming, all of these projects will be written entirely in C++; they are designed to expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques that are important in C++, and to prepare you for later coursework in ICS, such as ICS 46.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not assume that any of you will have previous C++ experience, though I do expect that all of you have at least a year or so of introductory programming experience in some language other than C++.  For a lot of you, that will have been our first-year sequence in Python; others will have taken our previous first-year sequence in Java, or introductory courses in other places in any of a variety of programming languages.  In general, if you have some experience programming in <i>something</i> &mdash; equivalent in depth to what you might have learned in our first-year courses &mdash; you'll be fine, provided that you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn something new, especially something that might look and feel quite different from what you're accustomed to.  Your most important focus when learning a new programming language is forming an understanding of the appropriate idioms the new language provides, as opposed to attempting a line-for-line translation from the language you prefer to the language you're learning; different programming languages encourage you to think differently about programming problems, and you might find C++ to be a big departure from what you've seen before, but big departures are how you grow your knowledge and ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that C++ programming requires a level of care and attention to detail that exceeds what you may have experienced in languages you've used previously, requiring a dual focus on both higher-level abstractions and lower-level implementation details that many languages hide and/or handle automatically.  Focusing on the small details of the code you write is more important than it is in many other languages.  Debugging can be more of an adventure, given that program crashes will not necessarily be accompanied with the clarity of diagnostics to which you've become accustomed.  For these reasons, it's important to start your work <i>early</i>, encounter problems <i>early</i>, and get questions asked and answered <i>early</i>.  Many of the most perplexing debugging problems I've ever faced in my professional career were in C++ programs, and having enough time to get these kinds of issues resolved may well be the difference between finishing your work or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While prior C++ (or C) experience is neither required nor assumed, it doesn't hurt; however, if you have prior experience, especially in C, you may find that some of the practices you've learned in the past are not acceptable in this course.  We're focused not just on writing programs that generate the correct output, but at least as importantly on techniques that modularize programs, manage and hide complexity, and generally make the best use of what C++ has to offer, above and beyond what is provided by its C heritage.  (It's important to realize that, while C and C++ share a common lineage, they have diverged in a number of ways in the last couple of decades; be aware that our focus here is squarely on C++, not C.)  We'll start with some of the baseline concepts first &mdash; and ignore a lot of the higher-level abstractions &mdash; but will quickly realize that writing clear C++ programs requires avoiding the manual, error-prone techniques as often as possible, so we'll gradually learn techniques to automate them or render them unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Evaluation of your work</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Evaluation criteria</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of your projects will be graded on a 30-point scale, with the points split (albeit unevenly) into two categories: <i>correctness and robustness</i> (i.e., does the program work?) and <i>quality and design</i> (i.e., how well is the program written?).

Though we will make an honest effort to assess its overall correctness and quality, we can, at our discretion, assign a score as low as zero to a program that does not compile, and you can assume that your score on such a program will not necessarily apporach the percentage of completeness and correctness you actually achieved, as it is impossible for us to measure that without being able to run and test your program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the level of experience that is assumed of you, you should be able to ensure that code compiles, even in a partially-completed program; you should be able to work incrementally, save copies when you reach stable state, and so on.

It's not unreasonable to expect that you may find it difficult to finish one of the projects on time, even if you're on top of things most of the time.  I get emails often from students, saying things like <i>If I just had one more day to work on this, I'd get it done!</i>  On the other hand, being consistently behind is a recipe for struggle in this course; we'll be moving quickly, and it will be progressively harder to catch up the farther behind you get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best balance between these two realities is that everyone is allowed to have a tough time with a project once this quarter with no penalty &mdash; maybe you underestimated the difficulty of an assignment, maybe you have three midterms and a paper due the same day, maybe you have a sudden outside commitment that can't be avoided.  However, we generally require to keep up with the due dates as assigned, and we do generally assign a penalty for work submitted late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Submitting late work</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the \"one-time\" late submission, described below, late work is accepted according to the following policy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><i>You may submit late work, subject to a penalty of 1% of your final score <b>per hour</b> beyond the deadline.</i></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Full or partial hours are counted.  So, for example, a project submitted at 3:15am the morning after an 11:59pm deadline would be subject to a 4% penalty, because it was submitted 3-1/4 hours late (i.e., three full hours plus a partial one).  In that example, if your score on the project would have been 27/30 ordinarily, it will be reduced by 4% and become 25.92/30 instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The \"one-time\" late submission</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To accommodate the occasional unforeseen issue, we do also allow a \"one-time\" late submission:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><i>Each student is permitted to submit any one project up to 48 hours late with no penalty, with no questions asked about why and <b>no prior notification required</b>.</i></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purposes of clarification, here are some additional details about how this policy works.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>You are not required to notify us in advance &mdash; in fact, in all honesty, we'd prefer that you didn't.  (There are a lot of students in this course, so that would represent a lot of extra work for us.)  We'll be looking for submissions beyond the deadline of each project, so yours won't be lost in the shuffle.</li>\r\n  <li>There is a ten-minute grace period after the due date, allowing you time to get your files submitted to Checkmate.  If you submitted your files at 12:08am for an 11:59pm due date, you're fine.  Best not to play with fire, though, if you're already done before 11:59pm; at 12:11am, you'll have used up your one-time extension.  <i>No exceptions!</i></li>\r\n  <li>If any one file is submitted beyond the ten-minute grace period, the entire project is considered late, and falls under the late work policy.</li>\r\n  <li>If you submit more than one project late this quarter, we will automatically determine the best possible outcome for you, so that you get the maximum benefit from this policy.  For example:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Suppose you submit Project 1 five hours late and your score would have been 10/30.</li>\r\n      <li>Suppose you submit Project 2 two hours late and your score would have been 30/30 before taking lateness into account.</li>\r\n      <li>The late penalty on Project 1 would be 5% of 10 points, or 0.5 points.</li>\r\n      <li>The late penalty on Project 2 would be 2% of 30 points, or 0.6 points.</li>\r\n      <li>Given these numbers, we will apply the \"one-time\" exception to Project 2, since it will provide you the most benefit (0.6 points instead of 0.5).</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, this procedure is automatic and does not require negotiation or notification; we will apply this consistently to everyone.  The goal is that this should accommodate the unforeseen issues that might otherwise prevent you from finishing a project on time, while freeing course staff to focus on other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">What to do if you're chronically late</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out-of-the-ordinary circumstances sometimes warrant exceptions to this policy; if you are faced with a problem that is preventing you from getting your work done on time, either on a single assignment or chronically, please contact me and we can talk about how best to approach the problem.  It's important to contact me sooner rather than later; earlier in the quarter, there are a lot more things I can do to help than there are in the tenth week or after the final course grades are determined.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Development environment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike programming languages such as Java or Python, which make it a point to be (more or less) independent of the platform (i.e., the hardware, the operating system, etc.) that they run on, C++ is decidedly <i>platform-dependent</i>.  This is especially true in the recent years, as two new versions of the C++ Standard, called C++11 and C++14, have been completed, but not all compiler implementers have implemented all of the new features of the language yet (and library support is even more hit-or-miss).  And even amongst the features that all compilers share, there are differences &mdash; all the way down to details such as the maximum value you can store in a variable of type <b>int</b>! &mdash; that make it important for us to agree on a single development environment: a particular compiler running on a particular operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because not every one of you will be running the same operating system on your own machine, and to avoid the problem of having each of you install and configure the necessary software yourselves, the officially-supported development environment for ICS 45C is provided in the form of a <i>virtual machine</i>, a complete environment that includes an operating system, compiler, debugger, text editors, and so on; we'll call this the <i>ICS 45C VM</i>.  Rather than installing software, you'll download the ICS 45C VM and run it as an application on your computer, but log into it as though it was a separate computer.  This is explained in more detail in <a href=\"Project0\">Project #0</a>, which describes how to download it and set it up for use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">What if I don't want to use the ICS 45C VM?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything we do this quarter will be standard C++14.  Aside from incompatibilities between compilers &mdash; both those arising from new features that are implemented by some compilers and not others, as well as platform dependencies &mdash; I would expect you to be in good shape using something else a large percentage of the time, though you'll find that you hit bumps in the road sometimes, and it may not be obvious when you do.  You may write programs that work in your environment but don't work in the provided environment; this is a realistic possibility in C++, especially when we're working with newer language features that aren't implemented in every compiler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware that we will be grading your work using the ICS 45C VM, so, at minimum, you should <i>always</i> test your projects in the ICS 45C VM before submitting your work.  Submitting work that compiles on your favorite compiler but not in the ICS 45C VM is viewed the same as any other work that does not compile at all; as when you work for (or with) someone else professionally, you don't always get to choose your favorite environment to work, and have to adapt to what is appropriate to the situation.  Additionally, be aware that you're on your own to get software other than the ICS 45C VM set up and configured; we can't realistically support everyone's separate home installation, whereas the ICS 45C VM gives us a single system to support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also (and especially if you've never used Linux before or spent a lot of time on a command line), you should consider the practical usefulness of learning new skills that will no doubt prove to be valuable as you pursue professional and academic options further down the line.  Trying out something new while having the safety net of a large course staff to help you is a lot better than struggling with it on your own.  Even if only for that reason, I'd strongly encourage you to use the ICS 45C VM for all of your work, even if it seems like a difficult transition at first.  Linux and command lines are an important part of real-world computing, and you would be wise to gain some experience with them.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Submitting your projects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you complete each project, you must submit it to us electronically to a web-based system called Checkmate.  Follow <a href=\"SubmittingProjects.html\">this link</a> for a detailed description of how to submit your projects via Checkmate.  Understand that we will only accept projects submitted using the procedure described there; we <i>do not</i> accept printed copies of your projects, nor do we accept them via email <i>under any circumstances</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are responsible for submitting the version of your project that you want graded.  We will grade the most recent submission made before the deadline.  Accidentally submitting the wrong version will not be considered grounds for a regrade.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Academic honesty</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ICS 45C or CSE 45C students, you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole.  Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of your lab work is expected to be completed <i>solely by you</i>.  Worker in larger groups and/or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted.  Note that \"high-level discussion of course material for better understanding\" is permitted and encouraged, but when it comes time to sit down and write code, that is expected to be done by you and you alone.  All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system.  This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions, even when there are superficial differences.  (Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter, so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in, or even refer to, code written by a friend of yours who took the course already.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you, you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else's work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Academic honesty is a two-way street.  Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted anymore than turning in someone else's code.  Resist the temptation to give code to your friends \"for reference.\"  Based on my experience, I can say that your \"friends\" may very well betray you and turn it in, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts.  Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy.  They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade.  Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The lesson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so the moral of the story is that it's wise to avoid cheating.  I believe that it's relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it; why come to UCI if you're not planning to get something out of the coursework?  So why do people cheat every quarter in every course?  The answers vary, but here's the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I've had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years: <i>I fell behind and couldn't figure out how to catch up</i>.  Things happen and ten-week quarters are unforgiving.  You might get sick, you might have issues crop up in your family, you might have an off-campus job that's demanding too much of your time, you might be trying to decide whether you're on the path you want to be on... Any of those things (and many others) can make it hard to keep up.  You fall a little behind, you fall a little further behind, and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless.  You're under pressure, temptation gets the better of you...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel like you're beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control, the best thing to do is to talk to us <i>sooner rather than later</i>.  We're here to help; we understand.  But the reality of taking large-sized courses at a large-sized institution is that we're not going to know you're in need unless you tell us.  If things are happening in your life, tell us; you don't have to be specific if you're not comfortable with it.  Before the fact, there's often a way to work things out.  After the fact, it's usually too late.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"history\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\r\n  <li>Late work policy updated and clarified by Alex Thornton, Fall 2014</li>\r\n  <li>Originally written by Alex Thornton, Fall 2013, with heavy influence in some sections from the Project Guide from the most recent iteration of ICS 65</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 1383.0}
