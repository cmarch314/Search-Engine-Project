friends Both Sudha and I grew up here so we have lots of family and friends here This is where we met and got married We both went to schools and colleges here and went through all the things that young people used to do in this city So there are lots of memories here Nagpur is growing like most other cities in India Lot of new construction going on everywhere The city has grown in every direction Something unique about Nagpur is its cleanliness and quality of roads compared to other cities in India About 4 years ago the city was cleaned and beautified It started looking like a new city Unlike most other places that do not maintain their roads and cleanliness well Nagpur has maintained it It is an example that Indian cities don t have to be messy and filthy Even with its growth it is maintaining the quality That is very impressive Though Nagpur is growing it is far from a high tech city I am staying in one of the most expensive hotels Centre Point but there is no Internet facility here Suzi had to send some mail and the material was on her USB drive and she could not do it despite visiting two cybercaf s I am involved in a IT outsourcing company Lambent Technology here that is the most prominent high tech company I got involved because I wanted to see such activities in Nagpur Shashi and his team has done great job in building this as a local success But at the national level Lambent has a long way to go I run into many people here who want to do things in Nagpur and make it a great place Yesterday I was contacted by Prasad Dhurjati to discuss formation of an ambitious biotech research university here It is truly a small world possible smaller in places like Nagpur Prasad was discussing his plans with a group and said he wished Ramesh Jain were in town to bounce off ideas and somebody who overheard him said He is and I can track down a telephone number for him and he hid I was really surprised when contacted because I could not imagine that somebody will get my telephone number a new one that I got for Sudha within hours of my getting the number It is the biggest city in central India and a big trading center Now a big Airline Hub is likely to come here which is starting with a cargo hub This is already resulting in attracting some important national players here Some International flights have already started landing here So this place may be in for growth By Ramesh December 28 2 5 Technical Thoughts 43 Comments Systems in IndiaProduct company in Nagpur 43 thoughts on Nagpur Abhijit Belapurkar December 28 2 5 at 9 55 pm Dear Dr Jain I have been a reader of your blog for some time now Your reminiscing about Nagpur brought back fond memories of the place My grandparents used to live there and we used to go there every summer for a long fun filled vacation My parents live there now and everytime I visit Nagpur I am struck just as you were by how well it has managed to sustain its clean city looks my father told me the city has been winning awards for being the cleanest city in India etc I have long wondered why Nagpur doesn t seem to interest any of the large Indian players Infy Wipro etc as a potential dev center It has a fairly good airport well as good as Pune at least FWIW and its central location makes it very accessible by rail Good climate IMO at least schools VRCE I guess it s been labeled an NIT now etc etc What s not to like Quite the mystery to me I am looking over http www lambenttek com even as I write this Ramesh Post authorDecember 29 2 5 at 9 19 pm Rumors are that Satyam has bought more than 1 acres of land to build their operations in Nagpur Initially most major players focused on a few cities and Nagpur missed on that It is likely however that in the next wave that seems to be starting it may be a major player paresh nautiyal October 24 2 6 at 12 57 am Sir reading your blog fascinated and encouraged me by seeing achivements of fellow nagpurians though nagpur needs people like you at this crutial stage where it can come of age big time regards paresh Sunil November 1 2 6 at 4 16 am Dear Sir Interesting 2 read yr observation abt Nagpur Every city has its own advantages and shortcomings which goes on changing with the time Nagpur is also not exception As far as future of this city is concerned advantages are far more than shortcomings but will need some time i e 3 4 years to slowly realise the potential of this city And I am sure as it has changed from 1996 to 2 6 similarly it will be 2 different city by 2 16 rgd Sunil Jateen May 2 2 7 at 3 7 am Well Nagpur has finally arrieved Here are soem facts Wipro purchased 117 acres in Nagpur HCL purchased 17 acres in Nagpur 1 carore investment Satyam 1 acres Infosys Rumours that they are coming since all major players have come TCS planned R D centre in Nagpur Ascendas 9 carore in IT infrastructure Singapore based group Dell 7 acres DLF 154 acres Shapoorji Pallonji 1 acres New cricket stadium of VCA at

Shembekar May 24 2 7 at 3 37 am Lambent is not the only big IT co in Nagpur 1 Persistent Systems Pune has one of its dev center in the Parsodi IT park It is going to shift in an independednt building of its own in the IT park 2 Info spectrum India Pvt Ltd is grwoing up fast It has joint hands with avexus inc USA for avaiation software development They are laso shifting in their own state of the art building very soon 3 premier Technology group PTG also shifting to theri own building in IT park 4 There are other companies like Infocepts Zeon soutions etc who are growing up fast Prasanna Shembekar Energy Avenues The executive search 94228 7548 yogita June 5 2 7 at 1 47 am Hi Though not born in Nagpur am staying here since 6 years Have seen a lot of progress myself in this span But the sadest part is no talent of this city wants to stay here and build competitive companies in the city itself Everybody runs away for the cream Who will make the cream of this city tastier and attractive for others to venture I myself am not happy with the kind of proffessional opportunities here When it comes to money no one is ready to pay good for a good talented work keeping my fingers crossed some day always keep the HOPE Jateen June 6 2 7 at 1 44 am I agree with you Yogita But it will take some time for people to understand the full potential of Nagpur Further the companies have invested but they are yet to start their operations from Nagpur So once they start people will definitely come and also it will make companies there more professional about money they offer But it will take atleast 1 5 to 2 yrs Once any big name like Wipro Satyam or HCL start their operations things will change very fast and that will bring more comapnies which are yet sceptical or waiting to start their operations from Nagpur Ramesh Post authorJune 6 2 7 at 3 22 pm Cultural and social changes always are slow and given our Indian setting they are usually slower Things are really on a strong positive trajectory in Nagpur as in India but lately seem to be faster than on average in India It is clear that you are at the right place at the right time and the right thing is to participate in it and be patient Victoria June 7 2 7 at 1 14 am Well sounds like you are having a great time in Nagpur Looks like the place is the center for a lot investment activity Jateen June 11 2 7 at 11 56 pm Radisson is coming up with Hotel at Wardha Road which will be ready by December 2 9 Here is the link for this information http www asiatraveltips com news 7 126 RadissonHotelNagpur shtml Parag June 15 2 7 at 9 12 am Floks Nagpur s time has finally arrived Jateen June 21 2 7 at 7 am Now its the turn of Mantri s turn to come to Nagpur Mantri to invest Rs 1 6 cr in city Amol June 26 2 7 at 1 28 am Good response Nagpur is most happning city in central India big players are coming to nagpur will definately change the face of city more and more corporates are investing in nagpur Not only names in IT companies given above one of the company CsTech Since Year 1998 first company with web solutions domain hosting web development web designing everybody depends upon mumbai delhi based company for this service this compnay provides same quality services in nagpur not only few name given above but this company serving 2 clients across the globe Europa July 4 2 7 at 1 18 pm I am so glad to read such positive response from Nagpur I for one have decided to come back to the my home city after a decade I remember taking in lung fulls of air every time i landed in nagpur Its heartening to note that there are good opportunities coming up and I am hoping for a decent job here Would anyone know some placement agencies From europaandio gmail com Jateen July 12 2 7 at 11 18 pm Cargo Hub Delayed The Vidarbha politicians are doign it again CArgo hub has been delayed A section of farmers are not ready to give their lands at govt prices Govt specially Vidarbha politicians are not keen to solve this issue MADC has not been handed over the AirPort by AAI So we are doing it again This last chance of development will be wasted if people do nt act fast this project may be moved to Western Maharashtra cities like Pune or Nashik which i seriously think is the main plot Shivsena which is vocal about Eksandh Maharashtra which does nt care a damn about suicide of Vidarbha farmers has jumped to sabotag this project Shrinidhi July 21 2 7 at 12 22 am With the amount of investment that has already been poured in by both public MIHAN private players in development work being carried out on site it s now unlikely that the process can be reversed However political will of local politicians having national level stature like Mr Praful Patel representing this area needs to be forcefully sustained all the way Shrinidhi Nandedkar Architect jateen July 26 2 7 at 8 33 am Political will is very important It can crerate rivers in deserts Unfortunately Vidarbha politicians never have any will than earning money by opening Engineering and Medical colleges Also they were forced to think about Nagpur bcoz it is prominent city in central India alongwith Indore and also bcoz Mumbai and Pune are getting overcrowded The best thing is that they do nt looked towards cities like Nashik Kolhapur and other western Maharashtra cities which always got money and prominence over Nagpur Further as major cities getting costly being in central india gives wider reach for companies Also SEZ here and city with very good infrastructure has attracted many I always thought that cities like Nagpur Indore and Bhopal can create a traingle to attract investment in central india which is totally untapped region as far as industries are concerned Hope this investment environment to continues soheb August 1 2 7 at 4 38 am hi sir im soheb from nagpur im mlm nagpur pls contacte no 986 12 818 rahul August 23 2 7 at 11 22 am Dear Mr Jain I am looking forward for a business opportunity in the coming days wd seek your advice abour exim business hope you wil help me with same Regards Rahul Sharma Prashant P September 5 2 7 at 2 53 am Well I am glad to see am not the only one who cares for Nagpur so much When ever I go on the internet my wife will pass a comment not again as the first thing after hooking onto my laptop I will key in Nagput on Google and read some news about Nagpur and tell her the great guys going Nagpur It makes me feel glad that I belong to city which is organically while still keeping the values and tradition I ve been working on to return back to Nagpur since past 6 years and glad to see myself moving back with family next year to expedite my activity with company that I established in 2 3 Way back in 1999 when I left Nagpur I knew that I cannot stay away longer from this beautiful city and has always dream of making big out of this our Hometown we all fellow Nagpurion can really make it a great place in many ways such as 1 Spending money in all good things in the city that we otherwise would have done out of this city 2 Encourage all innovative business owner and guide them of what best they can do within their current limit based on our own global experiences 3 Encourage young entrepreneurs with the expert guidance that we have gained out of working around the globe And many more such indicative contribution can be made even before we personally get involved to make NAGPUR a happening place to be linked with Jateen September 7 2 7 at 6 6 am I am at Pune but sad to see that many people that settled here which are originally from Nagpur does nt think much for the city There is a perception that Nagpur will never develop which to a great extent is also bcoz lot of promises were made by our politicians earlier but never fulfilled Nagpur was ignored humiliated by moving the money of its share to other cities never got status of Second Capital in reality its only on paper but no one bothered Ngpur will develop if our collective urge is strong to develop it So many people like me left Nagpur bcoz there were no higher end jobs We ourselve are guity not tos et up or start industries there Hope Cargo and SEZ will change that as investment continue to pour in People now beginned to understand the benefits of beign at centre of India Ajay Rathore October 4 2 7 at 2 43 am Yes you are right Jateen Politician here are wants to eat butter on dead body They are not hungry about the progress but wants to earn popularity for no work only Take example of Medical University previously it was supposed to be in Nagpur but now it is in Nashik There was supposed to be a railway coach factory in orange city but its not there Generations are changing but the status of political progress is not Everything is in hands of political leader MPs MLAs of city are not struggling to the desired level Anybody comes and slaps it e g Train services like Maharashtra express and now Vidarbha express are stolen away from city lots of examples You note down one thing that Cargo and Mihan are not going to operation in atleast next 2 years Thats the reason real Nagpurian are not interested in fake promises shown by local politicians Jateen December 15 2 7 at 1 12 am Well Ajay you are right b Cargo Hub is unlikely to complete or succeed b There are strong political forces which are blockign Nagpur Cargo Hub b Nagpur airport has nt been handed over to MADC b Now we heard that 4 k investment will be coming up on Mumbai Pune Highway I bet with anyone this project will complete much faster that Nagpur Cargo Hub As far as Nagpur Cargo Hub is concerned i fear that within some months time it will be shifted out Nagpur as there is not enougth pressure for this project God Save My City Dr Vivek Polshettiwar February 8 2 8 at 3 53 pm There is no good research center in Vidharba and opening of DRDO center will be great achivement I worked with DRDO for 3 years and I know thier labs are richest in terms of facilty and projects and the students of vidharbha will definately get benefited Infact if there is any DRDO opening in Nagpur no of scientist like me in USA will return to India We all Vidharbhians should fight for the betterment of our region otherwise we will losse everything what we deserve youtube February 11 2 8 at 6 56 pm reading your blog fascinated and encouraged me

last three days.  These have been busy days among family and friends.  Both Sudha and I grew up here so we have lots of family and friends here.  This is where we met and got married.  We both went to schools and colleges here and went through all the things that young people used to do in this city.  So there are lots of memories here.</p>\n<p>Nagpur is growing like most other cities in India.  Lot of new construction going on everywhere.  The city has grown in every direction.  Something unique about Nagpur is its cleanliness and quality of roads compared to other cities in India.  About 4 years ago, the city was cleaned and beautified.  It started looking like a new city.  Unlike most other places that do not maintain their roads and cleanliness well, Nagpur has maintained it.  It is an example that Indian cities don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be messy and filthy.  Even with its growth, it is maintaining the quality.  That is very impressive.  </p>\n<p>Though Nagpur is growing, it is far from a high-tech city.  I am staying in one of the most expensive hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Centre Point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there is no Internet facility here.  Suzi had to send some mail and the material was on her USB drive and she could not do it despite visiting two cybercaf\u00c3\u00a9s.  I am involved in a IT outsourcing company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lambent Technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c here that is the most prominent high-tech company.  I got involved because I wanted to see such activities in Nagpur.  Shashi and his team has done great job in building this as a local success.  But at the national level, Lambent has a long way to go.</p>\n<p>I run into many people here who want to do things in Nagpur and make it a great place.  Yesterday I was contacted by Prasad Dhurjati to discuss formation of an ambitious biotech research university here.  It is truly a small world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possible smaller in places like Nagpur.  Prasad was discussing his plans with a group and said he wished Ramesh Jain were in town to bounce-off ideas and somebody who overheard him said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is and I can track down a telephone number for him\u00e2\u20ac? and he hid.  I was really surprised when contacted because I could not imagine that somebody will get my telephone number (a new one that I got for Sudha) within hours of my getting the number.</p>\n<p>It is the biggest city in central India and a big trading center.  Now, a big Airline Hub is likely to come here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is starting with a cargo-hub.  This is already resulting in attracting some important national players here.  Some International flights have already started landing here.  So this place may be in for growth.</p>\n  \t\t\t</div>\r\n  \t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta-bar clearfix\">\t        \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\r\n    \t\t\t\t<span class=\"by-author\">By <a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/author/ramesh/\">Ramesh</a></span> |\r\n    \t\t\t\t<span class=\"date\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/\" title=\"4:37 am\">December 28, 2005</a></span> |\r\n    \t\t\t\t             \t\t<span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/category/technical-thoughts/\" rel=\"category tag\">Technical Thoughts</a></span> |\r\n             \t \r\n    \t\t\t\t             \t\t<span class=\"comments\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/#comments\" title=\"Comment on Nagpur\">43 Comments</a></span> |\r\n             \t \t\t          \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\r\n    \t\t</div>\r\n\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"default-wp-page clearfix\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"previous\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/systems-in-india/\" rel=\"prev\"><span class=\"meta-nav\">&larr;</span> Systems in India</a></li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"next\"><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/product-company-in-nagpur/\" rel=\"next\">Product company in Nagpur <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;</span></a></li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\r\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments-area\">\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t<h1 class=\"comments-title\">\r\n\t\t\t43 thoughts on &ldquo;<span>Nagpur</span>&rdquo;\t\t</h1>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ol class=\"commentlist\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-378\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-378\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f13f421f8a53eb16e7fbaa9f0aa7e65f?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Abhijit Belapurkar </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/comment-page-1/#comment-378\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2005-12-28T21:55:46+00:00\">December 28, 2005 at 9:55 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Dear Dr. Jain,</p>\n<p>I have been a reader of your blog for some time now. Your reminiscing about Nagpur brought back fond memories of the place. My grandparents used to live there and we used to go there every summer for a long, fun-filled vacation. </p>\n<p>My parents live there now, and everytime I visit Nagpur, I am struck, just as you were, by how well it has managed to sustain its clean-city looks (my father told me the city has been winning awards for being the cleanest city in India etc.)</p>\n<p>I have long wondered why Nagpur doesn&#8217;t seem to interest any of the large Indian players (Infy, Wipro etc.) as a potential dev center.  It has a fairly good airport (well, as good as Pune at least, FWIW) and its central location makes it very accessible by rail. Good climate (IMO, at least), schools, VRCE (I guess it&#8217;s been labeled an NIT now) etc. etc&#8230;. What&#8217;s not to like?

When it comes to money no one is ready to pay good for a good talented work. keeping my fingers crossed&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.some day&#8230;.. always keep the HOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1034\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1034\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/854d8c4929bc72c0a483f282cd555be0?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Jateen </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/comment-page-1/#comment-1034\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-06-06T10:44:27+00:00\">June 6, 2007 at 10:44 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>I agree with you Yogita.But it will take some time for people to understand the full potential of Nagpur.Further the companies have invested but they are yet to start their operations from Nagpur.

Also SEZ  here and city with very good infrastructure has attracted many. I always thought that cities like Nagpur, Indore and Bhopal can create a traingle  to attract investment in central india  which is totally untapped region as far as industries are concerned&#8230;Hope this investment environment to continues&#8230;.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1101\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1101\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3041b481cdbdcb5bf82227fa7a77cd73?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.yahoo.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>soheb</a> </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/comment-page-1/#comment-1101\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-08-01T04:38:01+00:00\">August 1, 2007 at 4:38 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>hi sir im<br />\nsoheb<br />\nfrom<br />\nnagpur<br />\nim mlm<br />\nnagpur<br />\npls contacte no 9860120818</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1136\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1136\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9447ad35c179f10726c65cdcde826c4?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">rahul </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/comment-page-1/#comment-1136\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-08-23T11:22:10+00:00\">August 23, 2007 at 11:22 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Dear Mr Jain,</p>\n<p>I am looking forward for a business opportunity in the coming days wd seek your advice abour exim business, hope you wil help me with same.</p>\n<p>Regards<br />\nRahul Sharma</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1168\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1168\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4219d67901e9252336b5b0c166136192?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.pranam.co.in' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Prashant P</a> </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/comment-page-1/#comment-1168\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-09-05T02:53:38+00:00\">September 5, 2007 at 2:53 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Well, I am glad to see am not the only one who cares for Nagpur so much.

Politician here are wants to eat butter on dead body. They are not hungry about the progress but wants to earn popularity for no work only. Take example of Medical University, previously it was supposed to be in Nagpur, but now it is in Nashik. There was supposed to be a railway coach factory in orange city, but its not there. Generations are changing but the status of political progress is not. Everything is in hands of political leader. MPs, MLAs of city are not struggling to the desired level. Anybody comes and slaps it. (e.g. Train services like Maharashtra express and now Vidarbha express are stolen away from city&#8230;. lots of examples ). You note down one thing that Cargo and Mihan are not going to operation in atleast next 20 years. Thats the reason real Nagpurian are not interested in fake promises shown by local politicians.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\r\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\r\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1313\">\r\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1313\" class=\"comment\">\r\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/854d8c4929bc72c0a483f282cd555be0?s=44&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D44&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Jateen </cite><a href=\"http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/nagpur/comment-page-1/#comment-1313\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-12-15T01:12:18+00:00\">December 15, 2007 at 1:12 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Well Ajay you are right!!!
