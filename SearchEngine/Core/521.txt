original paper along with pseudocode for the algorithm can be found here The description is quite nice and contains all the information needed to implement the algorithm The following directory contains two images Your task for this assignment is to Fill in the hole in fill png The hole is defined as pixels that have intensity Pad the image extend png by 11 pixels on each side It is currently 53x49 pixels and you will need to add pixels until it is 75x71 pixels downloads Programming 25 points Write the following 4 functions each in their own file with the following prototypes to

indices GetUnFilledNeighbors Image 5 pts matches errs FindMatches Template Image 1 pts Result FillImage Image WindowSize FillImage takes an input a grayscale image and fills in the values using Efros Leung Image a grayscale image with some missing pixels set to Windowsize The size of the window used for synthesis Result a grayscale image with all pixels filled in 1 points This function does all of the work It will call both GetUnFilledNeighbors and FindMatches in its body It will return the Image where all zero valued pixels have been filled with a synthesized pixel using Efros Leung s texture synthesis algorithm The content of the function follows the pseudocode linked above Loosely it loops over the set of unknown pixels which are adjacent to known pixel values For each unknown pixel in this set it finds the set of all matching pixel neighborhoods from the original Image It then randomly picks a matching neighbor to fill in the current unknown pixel function indices GetUnFilledNeighbors Image 5 pts GetUnFilledNeighbors Image grayscale image with some missing pixels set to indices The set of indices of unfilled pixels which are neighbors with a filled pixel 5 points This function looks for unfilled pixels which are next to at least one filled in pixel This can be computed efficiently using morphological dilate operation see here Let mask be a binary image where 1 denotes a filled in pixel imdilate mask ones 3 mask produces a binary image of unfilled pixels which are neighbors with a filled pixel One can find the indices of the non zero pixels using the find command I suggest using help for more information on these functions function match err FindMatch Template Image This function takes the patch Template and finds similar looking patches from Image Image grayscale image Template small grayscale image of size WindowSize by WindowSize match A vector of pixel values that match well with the center of Template err A vector of errs for each pixel value 1 points This function searches Image for image patches that match well with Template Note that template will always contain at least one unfilled pixel the center Use a Guassian weighted sum of squared difference SSD score to measure the match between the Template and a patch in the image You can use GaussMask fspecial gaussian size sigma to create a Gaussian mask Make sure that you don t use the unfilled pixels to score the match of the Template and a patch from the image Matlab Tips ind2sub is a handy command that generates the x y location corresonding to an index It will be useful to iterate over the list of indices returned by GetUnFilledNeighbors rand is the command for generating a random number This will be useful for randomly selected a matching patch One can multiply all the entries of two matrics A and B with A B This may prove useful for calculating the Guassian weighted SSD score Plot the image as you fill the pixels in like a movie This will be useful for debugging and also looks pretty cool Use imshow Image drawnow to plot the image and force Matlab to update the figure window Place this command within the main loop of FillImage m to generate a sequence of images Debug your code using a small WindowSize since this makes the algorithm faster Writeup 1 points Use both images for the writeup 5 points Show the results on expand png varying the
