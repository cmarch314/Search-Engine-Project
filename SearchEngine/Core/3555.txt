But it looks like n=5 is impossible even for non-integer \nlattices in R^d: the intersection of the lattice with the plane containing \nthe pentagon would have to itself be a planar lattice, but no planar \nlattice can contain the vertices of a regular pentagon, for if one had \nvertices abcde (say, in clockwise order) then (a+d-e) (b+e-a) (c+a-b) \n(d+b-c) (e+c-d) would be the vertices of a smaller pentagon, ad infinitum.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n", "id": 3555.0}
