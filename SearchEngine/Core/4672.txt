Work experience Teaching Awards Research Projects COAST Services September 2 12 December 2 14 Collaborators Richard N Taylor The goal of this project is to enable the different participating parties in a domain to access data and computation capabilities they need however within the boundaries imposed by the service provider The premise is that due to privacy or work division organizations holding domain information may wish to provide differential and controlled access to this information according their individual privacy and operational policies On the other hand data consumers should be permitted to customize the service to fit their own needs within the authority granted to them We provide a solution based on the COAST style s architectural principles on computational exchange and formal policies to simultaneously provide customized and policy based differential access to personal health information Our solution is exhibited in COASTmed an electronic health record system prototype that provides personalized and customizable services to a range of users Work on this project has been published in the ICSE Companion 2 14 and on the Proceedings of FHIES SEHC 2 14 It has also been published in the Doctoral Dissertation entitled COAST Services Achieving Service Customization and Policy Based Differential Access in Personal Information Systems Access Control to Organizational Services June 2 14 September 2 14 Collaborators Justin Erenkrantz As an intern at Bloomberg L P we worked on a research project which focused on alternative more dynamic architectures and implementations of role and attribute based access control to intra and inter organizational services The prototype we produced shows how rights described as formal policies can provide a more scalable and secure solution compared to traditional access control implementations User oriented privacy preserving techniques for personalized online information services June 2 12 September 2 12 Collaborators Allan M Schiffman Jeff Shrager Privacy is a primary concern when using online services mostly when accessing personal medical information for which disclosing critical private data is required During my summer internship at CommerceNet I conducted research on knowledge based privacy preserving techniques that protect the user from disclosing unnecessary information private in nature and which could lead to user re identification but still obtaining high service accuracy The premise is that personalized online data services often request additional information for secondary purposes outside the scope of the user s service Work on this project has been published in the PST 2 13 Conference Proceedings Computational e commerce December 2 11 May 2 12 Collaborators Richard N Taylor Fundamental components of e commerce namely negotiation contracts and business workflow have been largely researched in isolation resulting in divergent technologies that pose integration challenges We investigate the intersection of these e commerce phases and propose a computation based model for the integration and dynamic co adaptation of negotiation contracts and workflow Work on this project has been published in the EC Web 2 12 conference in Vienna and in the E Commerce and Web Technologies journal Integrative e commerce architectures September 2 11 May 2 12 Collaborators Richard N Taylor This project is concerned with the qualitative evaluation of e commerce architectures and on the integration of e commerce technologies that enable representing commercial contracts negotiating these contracts and that finally guide the inter dependent workflow of decentralized parties We conducted a survey of technologies that integrate negotiation contracts and business workflow concerns The evaluation is based on criteria such as the approach towards the integration of these e commerce phases automation dynamic adaptation decentralization arity of the interaction
