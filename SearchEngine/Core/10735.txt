c ordered by Figure 1 The integers totally ordered by a chain Figure 3 Incomparable items forming an antichain Figure 4 Part of the java util inheritance structure Let P be a set and be a partial order on P Then P and form a partially ordered set If the order is total so that no two elements of P are incomparable then the ordered set is a totally ordered set Totally ordered sets are the ones people are first familiar with See Figure 1 for an example A totally ordered set is also termed a chain If the order is partial so that P has two or more incomparable elements then the ordered set is a partially ordered set See Figure 2 for an example At the other extreme if no two elements are comparable unless they are equal then the ordered set is an antichain See Figure 3 On any set is an order this is termed the discrete order on the set Any set ordered by forms an antichain It is common for people to refer briefly though inaccurately to an ordered set as an order to a totally ordered set as a total order and to a partially ordered set as a partial order It is usually clear by context whether order refers literally to an order an order relation or by synecdoche to an ordered set Examples The integers with form an ordered set see Figure 1 is a total order on the integers so this ordered set is a chain Any powerset with forms an ordered set see Figure 2 This is a partially ordered set because not all subsets are related by for example a b r A set of unrelated items ordered by is the discrete order on that set and forms an antichain see Figure 3 The classes in java util with the subclass relation form an ordered set see Figure 4 This set is partially ordered because not all classes in the set are related by the subclass relations for example Vector and HashSet are not related and are thus incomparable Vector HashSet A set of binary strings with the prefix relation forms an ordered set see Figure 5 This is set is partially ordered because not all strings are related by the prefix relation for example 1 1 The non empty conjunctions of any of the propositions p q and r ordered by implication form an ordered set see Figure 6 In this set p q implies q but p q neither implies nor is implied by q r so p q and q r are incomparable p q q r The positive integers N with the divisibility relation form an ordered set The divisibility relation relates m to n if m divides n written m n Thus 2 6 and 3 6 but not 4 6 i e 4 and 6 are incomparable written 4 6 because 4 does not divide 6 And for any n N 1 n and n n A part of this ordered set is shown in Figure 7 Figure 5 The binary strings no longer than 3 ordered by the prefix relation Figure 6 The conjunctions of any of p q and r ordered by implication Figure 7 The positive integers to 15 ordered by the divisibility relation Duality Figure 8 The dual of the ordered set in Figure 7 Each ordered set P corresponds to another ordered set P the dual of P defined by y x in P iff x y in P Each statement about P corresponds to a dual statement about P is obtained by replacing each occurrence of in by and each occurrence of in by is true about P if and only if is true about P Generalizing it can be shown that if a statement is true about all ordered sets then its dual statement is also true This assertion is the Duality Principle Pairs of dual concepts that are defined in terms of and such as upper bound and lower bound below are also exchanged in dual statements Example Let Q be the ordered set shown in Figure 7 in which is the integer divides relation with the divisor lower than the dividend Then the ordered set of the positive integers to 15 ordered by the converse of divides now with the divisor considered higher than the dividend is the dual Q of Q The converse of 1 relates two integers if one divides the other but unlike it classifies the numerically smaller integer as the higher one by this relation so that for this order 2 1 for example Q is shown in Figure 8 In Q 4 8 so we know without looking at Figure 8 that in Q the dual statement 4 8 holds in the relation for that ordered set Extrema Let S be an ordered set u S is said to be maximal in S iff there is no v S such that u v A set may have any number of maximal elements including zero If u is S s only maximal element then u is the maximum of S The maximum element u if it exists is also called the top of S and is denoted by Dually t S is said to be minimal in S iff there is no s S such that s t A set may have any number of minimal elements including zero If t is S s only minimal element then t is the minimum of S The minimum element t if it exists is also called the bottom of S and is denoted by Examples p q r is a maximal element of the set in Figure 6 Since it is the only maximal element it is the maximum or top The set in Figure 6 has three minimal elements p q and r It has no minimum because it has three minimal elements The set of all integers has no maximal or minimal elements Figure 1 It has no maximum because it has no maximal elements similarly it has no minimum Bounds Upper bounds and LUBs Figure 5 again The binary strings no longer than 3 ordered by the prefix relation with prefix low Let S be an ordered set and let E S y S is an upper bound of E iff x y for every x E E may have no upper bound one upper bound or many Note that y need not be an element of E in order to be an upper bound of E We write Eu to denote the set of all upper bounds of E Eu may be empty a singleton or have many members If Eu is non empty and has a minimum element u then u is called the least upper bound LUB of E written E The LUB of E is also called the supremum or join of E In the common case where E consists of exactly two elements s and t we can also write s t pronounced the least upper bound of s and t or s join t Examples using the ordered set of Figure 5 as S Consider E 1 E has several upper bounds in S 1 itself 1 and 11 so EU 1 1 11 EU has a minimum element under the prefix relation and that minimum is 1 so E 1 has a LUB of 1 in S Consider E 1 There is no element of S that is greater than both and 1 E thus has no upper bound in S and EU is empty EU has no minimum element under the prefix relation because it has no elements at all so E has no LUB in S Lower bounds and GLBs The dual concept for upper bound is lower bound and analogous definitions apply z S is a lower bound of E iff z x for every x E Note that z need not be an element of E in order to be a lower bound of E We write El to denote the set of all lower bounds of E If El is non empty and has a maximum element v then v is called the greatest lower bound GLB of E written E The GLB of E is also called the infimum or meet of E In the common case where E consists of exactly two elements s and t we can also write s t pronounced the greatest lower bound of s and t or s meet t Examples Figure 5 1 is Figure 3 scrambled eggs Jane Eyre has no GLB because it has no lower bound at all Existence of LUBs and GLBs A LUB GLB can fail to exist for either of two reasons There may be no upper lower bound at all Eu El may be empty for example the binary strings in Figure 5 and 1 There may be upper lower bounds but no least upper bound greatest lower bound There may be two or more minimal upper bounds maximal lower bounds that are not comparable so that neither can be least greatest for example the divisibility ordering in Figure 7 and 2 3 or There may be an infinite descending ascending chain of upper lower bounds so that none is minimal maximal for example as in the case of the reals with LUB and GLB synonyms and symbols The table below gives the several synonyms and symbols related to greatest lower bound and least upper bound NameAbbrev SynonymsOperatorGoes with least upper bound LUB supremum join top greatest lower boundGLBinfimum meet bottom Figure 9 The ordered set of Figure 6 lifted Lifting It is often useful for an ordered set to have a bottom but not all ordered sets have one for example the set in Figure 6 In this case we can produce a new ordered set with a bottom by adding a new least element to the original ordered set This process is called lifting and the result of lifting an ordered set P can be called P lifted written P Example The non empty conjunctions of any of p q and r ordered by implication see Figure 6 has no bottom element We can lift this set by adding a new element which is implied by all other elements Here may be thought of as representing the conjunction of propositions The lifted set is diagrammed in Figure 9 In terms of the knowledge expressed by each conjunction we may say that a conjunction is an assertion that we know each of its conjuncts is true thus for example p r is an assertion that we know p is true and we know r is true Then is an empty assertion one that does not assert that we know that any of p q or r are true Diagrams We have been using diagrams of ordered sets without defining what they mean relying on the reader s intuition It is time to confirm that intuition by defining what the diagrams mean First we must consider the concept of covering For x y set P ordered by we say x is covered by y written xy if x y and for any z P x z y implies x z This means that there is no element of P between x and y Equivalently we say y covers x A diagram or Hasse diagram of an ordered set is a graph in which each node corresponds to an element of the set each edge corresponds to a covering relation between the nodes it connects and if xy then the node for x is drawn in a lower position than the node for y Thus we see that in interpreting diagrams it does not matter whether one node is above or below another unless there is a monotonic path between them and that if there is a monotonic path from y through one or more nodes down to x there is no separate edge directly from y to x Examples in Figure 9 p q covers p because no other node is between them We may also write p is covered by p q or pp q The figure indicates that p q r implies q Even though there is no line directly from p q r to q we know this because there is a monotonically descending path from p q r to q There are non monotonic paths from p q to q r for example down to q and back up but this doesn t mean that p q implies q r because none of the paths are monotonically descending In fact p q q r Other examples In Figure 7 5 is below 9 but this doesn t mean that 5 9 because there is no monotonic path between them In fact 5 9 Isomorphisms on ordered sets The ordering of two sets may be the same even if the two sets are different Two ordered sets P and Q are order isomorphic written P Q if there is a mapping from P onto Q such that x y in P if and only if x y in Q Then is called an order isomorphism on the two sets In discussing ordered sets we often simply say P and Q are isomorphic or is an isomorphism It can be shown that two ordered sets are order isomorphic if and only if they can be drawn with identical diagrams Figure 9 again The ordered set of Figure 6 lifted Figure 2 again a b c ordered by Example The powerset of a b c ordered by the subset relation Figure 2 and the conjunctions of any of a b and c ordered by implication and lifted by the addition of Figure 9 are isomorphic The isomorphism between them is given in the table below x P x Q a b c a b c a b a b a c a c b c b c a a b b c c From this isomorphism we can see that because a b c b c we know that a b c implies b c or written in terms of Q a b c implies b c Constructing an ordered set from another ordered set Figure 6 again Q Conjunctions ordered by implication Figure 3 again P Incomparable items forming an antichain The disjoint union of two disjoint ordered sets P and Q written PQ is the union of P and Q with P s elements ordered as in P and Q s elements ordered as in Q and each element of P incomparable with each element of Q The diagram of PQ consists of P s diagram beside Q s diagram with no connection between them The linear sum of two disjoint ordered sets P and Q written P Q is the union of P and Q with P s elements ordered as in P and Q s elements ordered as in Q and x y for each x P and y Q The diagram of P Q consists of Q s diagram above P s diagram with an edge between each minimal element of Q and each maximal element of P Figure 1 Disjoint union PQ of Figures 3 P and 6 Q Figure 12 Linear sum Q P of Figs 6 Q and 3 P Figure 11 Linear sum P Q of Figs 3 P and 6 Q Examples using the ordered sets P from Figure 3 and Q from Figure 6 Figure 1 shows the disjoint union of P and Q written PQ In the disjoint union every elements from one set is incomparable to all elements in the other but each set retains its own ordering Figure 11 shows the linear sum of P and Q written P Q In the linear sum each set retains its own ordering but additionally each maximal element of the first set is covered by each minimal element of the second set The first set is an antichain so all its elements are trivially maximal The second set has three minimal elements and an edge is drawn down from each of the three minimal elements of Q to each of the five maximal elements of P Figure 12 shows the linear sum of Q and P written Q P In the linear sum each set retains its own ordering but additionally each maximal element of the first set is covered by each minimal element of the second set The first set has one maximal element which is thus a maximum The second set is an antichain so all its elements are trivially minimal and an edge is drawn down from each of the five minimal elements of P to the single maximal element of Q Down sets and up sets Figure 13 Down set 3 of ordered set of Figure 8 Figure 14 Up set 6 of ordered set of Figure 8 A subset Q of ordered set P with order is a down set of P if whenever x Q y P and y x then y Q Informally Q contains one or more maximal elements and every member of P that is below any member of Q Dually a subset Q of ordered set P with order is an up set of P if whenever x Q y P and y x then y Q Let R be an arbitrary subset of ordered set P with order Then the smallest down set containing R denoted R and pronounced down R is the set of all x P for which there is a y R such that x y Dually the smallest up set containing R denoted R and pronounced up R is the set of all x P for which there is a y R such that x y If R is a singleton set r then we may write r in place of r or R or dually r in place of r or R Such down sets up sets are termed principal down sets up sets of P Examples using the ordered set P shown in Figure 8 Q 3 6 9 12 15 is a down set of P Figure 13 To test this pick any element x of Q and any element y of P then if x y y Q For example pick 6 from Q Every element that 6 divides is in Q in this case the element 12 The same will be true of any element you pick from Q Q 3 6 9 12 15 is in fact a smallest down set and even a principal down set of P it is 3 It appears that only in infinite ordered sets is it possible that a down set is not also a smallest and principle down set Q 1 2 3 6 is an up set of P Figure 14 To test this pick any element x of Q and any element y of P then if y x y Q For example pick 6 from Q Every element that 6 divides is in Q in this case the elements 1 2 and 3 The same will be true of any element you pick from Q Q 1 2 3 6 is in fact a smallest up set and even a principal up set of P it is 6

(for example,\nthe set in Figure 6).&nbsp;\nIn this case,\nwe can produce a new ordered set with a bottom\nby adding a (new) least element to the original ordered set.&nbsp;\nThis process is called <dfn>lifting</dfn>,\nand the result of lifting an ordered set\n<span class='m'>P</span> can be called \"<span class='m'>P</span> lifted\",\nwritten P<sub>&perp;</sub>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nExample:&nbsp;\nThe non-empty conjunctions of any of\n<span class='m'>p</span>, <span class='m'>q</span>, and <span class='m'>r</span>,\nordered by implication (see <a href='#Figure6'>Figure 6</a>),\nhas no bottom element.&nbsp;\nWe can lift this set\nby adding a new element, &perp;,\nwhich is implied by all other elements.&nbsp;\nHere, &perp; may be thought of as representing\nthe conjunction of 0 propositions.&nbsp;\nThe lifted set is diagrammed in Figure 9.&nbsp;\nIn terms of the knowledge expressed by each conjunction,\nwe may say that\na conjunction is an assertion\nthat we know each of its conjuncts is true;\nthus, for example,\n<span class='m'>p</span>&and;<span class='m'>r</span> is an assertion that we know\n<span class='m'>p</span> is true and we know <span class='m'>r</span> is true.&nbsp;\nThen &perp; is an empty assertion,\none that does not assert that we know that any of\n<span class='m'>p</span>, <span class='m'>q</span>, or <span class='m'>r</span>\nare true.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<h1>Diagrams</h1>\n\n<p>\nWe have been using diagrams of ordered sets without defining what they mean,\nrelying on the reader's intuition.&nbsp;\nIt is time to confirm that intuition by defining what the diagrams mean.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p id='cover' title='cover'>\nFirst we must consider the concept of covering.&nbsp;\nFor <span class='m'>x</span>,<span class='m'>y</span> <span class='M'>&isin;</span>\nset <span class='m'>P</span> ordered by &le;,\nwe say <span class='m'>x</span> <dfn>is covered by</dfn> <span class='m'>y</span>\n(written\n<span class='m'>x</span><img src='img/coveredBy.png' alt='covered by'\nstyle='vertical-align:-2px;'/><span class='m'>y</span>)\nif <span class='m'>x</span>&lt;<span class='m'>y</span>\nand for any <span class='m'>z</span><span class='M'>&isin;</span><span class='m'>P</span>,\n<span class='m'>x</span>&le;<span class='m'>z</span>&lt;<span class='m'>y</span>\nimplies <span class='m'>x</span>=<span class='m'>z</span>.&nbsp;\nThis means that there is no element of <span class='m'>P</span> \"between\"\n<span class='m'>x</span> and <span class='m'>y</span>.&nbsp;\nEquivalently,\nwe say\n<span class='m'>y</span> <dfn>covers</dfn> <span class='m'>x</span>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA <dfn>diagram</dfn> (or  <dfn id='HasseDiagram' title='HasseDiagram'>Hasse diagram</dfn>) of an ordered set\nis a graph in which\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> each node corresponds to an element of the set,\n  </li>\n  <li> each edge corresponds to a covering relation between the nodes it connects,\n    and\n  </li>\n  <li> if\n    x<img src='img/coveredBy.png' alt='covered by' style='vertical-align:-2px;'/>y,\n    then the node for x is drawn in a lower position than the node for y.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nThus we see that\nin interpreting diagrams,\nit does not matter whether one node is above or below another\nunless there is a monotonic path between them;\nand that if there is a monotonic path from y through one or more nodes down to x,\nthere is no separate edge directly from y to x.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>Examples in Figure 9:\n</p>\n<ul class='egList'>\n  <li> <span

class='m'>q</span>&and;<span class='m'>r</span>\n    to <span class='m'>q</span>,\n    we know this because there is a monotonically-descending path from\n    <span class='m'>p</span>&and;<span class='m'>q</span>&and;<span class='m'>r</span>\n    to <span class='m'>q</span>.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li> There are non-monotonic paths from\n    <span class='m'>p</span>&and;<span class='m'>q</span> to\n    <span class='m'>q</span>&and;<span class='m'>r</span>\n    (for example, down to <span class='m'>q</span> and back up),\n    but this doesn't mean that <span class='m'>p</span>&and;<span class='m'>q</span>\n    implies <span class='m'>q</span>&and;<span class='m'>r</span>,\n    because none of the paths are monotonically descending.&nbsp;\n    In fact,\n    <span class='m'>p</span>&and;<span class='m'>q</span>&nbsp;||&nbsp;<span class='m'>q</span>&and;<span class='m'>r</span>.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other examples:\n</p>\n<ul class='egList'>\n  <li> In Figure 7, 5 is below 9\n    but this doesn't mean that 5&nbsp;|&nbsp;9\n    because there is no monotonic path between them.&nbsp;\n    In fact, 5&nbsp;||&nbsp;9.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h1>Isomorphisms on ordered sets</h1>\n\n<p id='isomorphic' title='isomorphic'>\nThe ordering of two sets may be the same\neven if the two sets are different.&nbsp;\nTwo ordered sets
