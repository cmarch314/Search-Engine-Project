{"text": "How to use X Score General synopsis for running X Score Parameters for setting input files Parameters for setting output files Parameters for setting scoring functions Parameters for setting chemical rules The shortcut to run X Score 1 General synopsis for running X Score The basic function of X Score is to compute the binding score of a given ligand molecule or multiple ligand molecules to a target protein All of the parameters needed to run X Score are assembled in an input parameter file click here to view an example You are supposed to edit this file to meet your own purpose To run X Score simply use this file as input xscore input parameter file The very first parameter in the input parameter file is FUNCTION which should be set as SCORE This tells the program to perform X Score computation You are not supposed to change this Other parameters specified in the input file will be explained below You can find an example input file under the bin and the c directory Note that all of the lines started with a sign in the input file will be considered as a comment line and is neglected by the program 2 Parameters for setting input files The first few parameters in the parameter file defines the input structural files X Score needs the three dimensional structure of the given protein ligand complex to calculate its binding constant The structure could be either experimentally determined or modeled by a docking program Since most today s molecular docking programs keep the protein structure rigid while docking the ligand molecules for the sake of efficient computation X Score requires the protein and the ligand molecules to be stored in two separate files The protein is required to be stored in a PDB file and the ligand molecules should be stored in a Mol2 file The parameter RECEPTOR PDB FILE specifies the path and the name of the PDB file that stores the protein molecule To prepare this PDB file 1 Remove any ligand molecule or other organic cofactors 2 If a metal ion resides in the binding site and is believed to be important for ligand binding keep it as part of the protein X Score considers this kind of metal ions explicitly in computation According to PDB convention a metal ion should be described by a line started by HETATM 3 For water molecules you may keep them in the PDB file also in the HETATM section However X Score will not consider them in computation 4 Remember to add hydrogen atoms X Score only needs polar hydrogen atoms on the protein in computation But adding all of the hydrogen atoms polar and non polar will not hurt Started from version 1 2 an additional utility FixPDB has been implemented in X Score to help users to prepare the input PDB file correctly Once you have finished the basic editing work described in the previous paragraph please use this utility to further process your PDB file Detailed description of the FixPDB utility is given on the next page The parameter LIGAND MOL2 FILE specifies the path and the name of the Mol2 file that stores the structures of the ligand molecules to be scored One thing should be kept in mind is the ligand molecules must be pre docked into the binding pocket of the target protein X Score will not do docking for you it only calculates the binding scores of given protein ligand complexes Also please make sure that the docked ligand molecules are saved in the same coordinate system as the protein molecule Since the Mol2 format is defined by Tripos naturally we recommend SYBYL for preparing all Mol2 files Other molecular modeling software may support the Mol2 format as well There are also some programs such as Babel which are designed for converting different formats However our experience is that such conversion is not always flawless To prepare the ligand molecules correctly 1 Please try your best to correctly set the atom types and bond types according to the Tripos conventions 2 All hydrogen atoms polar and non polar need to be added to the ligand molecules 3 Atomic charges are not necessary for X Score computation 4 If there are multiple ligand molecules all of them should be packed one after one in one file This is often referred as a multiple Mol2 file Since handling a very large file will probably slow down your computer significantly we do not recommend to pack too many molecules in one file A generally acceptable ceiling is 1 molecules typically several hundred MB in size If you have to process more molecules you may want to break them into several Mol2 files and run X Score respectively for each of them Started from version 1 2 an additional utility FixMol2 has been implemented in X Score to help users to prepare their Mol2 files correctly Once you have finished the basic editing work described in the previous paragraph please use this utility to further process your Mol2 files Detailed description of the FixMol2 utility is given on the next page An additional parameter added in version 1 2 is REFERENCE MOL2 FILE It specifies a ligand molecule bound to the protein This molecule will be used as a reference to define the binding pocket All of the residues within 1 angstrom from any part of this molecule are defined as pocket residues and will be considered in scoring If you already know any experimental complex structure of the protein you are studying using the ligand observed in that structure as this reference molecule is a good idea Or you can dock a proper molecule into the binding pocket on the protein and make sure it occupies all the important parts of the binding pocket Note that REFERENCE MOL2 FILE is optional If you do not want to set a reference molecule you may set this parameter as none or comment out this line by putting a sign as the first letter on that line In such cases X Score will use the first molecule saved in the LIGAND MOL2 FILE for defining binding pocket Of course the downside of this approach is that it may not define the binding pocket as precisely as the one using a proper reference molecule Another parameter is COFACTOR MOL2 FILE Sometimes there is an organic cofactor bound together with the ligand molecule inside the binding pocket such as CoA NADH and etc and you may want to keep it at its place when computing binding affinities of the ligand molecules In X Score you are allowed to supply such a cofactor molecule as part of the protein Since this kind of cofactors are usually not formed by any standard building blocks the PDB format is not proper for them For instead you can save the cofactor molecule in Mol2 format and specify its path and name with the COFACTOR MOL2 FILE parameter in the input file Please follow the instructions mentioned above to prepare this Mol2 file correctly Also make sure that this cofactor molecule shares the same coordinate system as the protein and the ligand molecules COFACTOR MOL2 FILE is also optional You may set it as none or comment out that line if you do not want to supply a cofactor molecule Finally we would like to point out that although there is no evidence that it cannot X Score was not originally calibrated to compute the binding affinity of a given ligand when a cofactor molecule exists Applying X Score to such cases is up to your own choice 3 Parameters for setting output files The next few parameters defines the output files that stores the results of X Score computation The basic output is defined by the OUTPUT TABLE FILE parameter which specifies a file tabulating the results of each scored ligand molecule click here to view an example The first line of this table is a title line Every following line contains the information of one ligand molecule The meaning of each column is The 1st column rank of the ligand All the ligand molecules are ranked in a decreasing order by their average binding affinities The 2nd column molecular formula The 3rd column molecular weight The 4th column LogP value The 5th column binding affinity given by HPScore in pKd units The 6th column binding affinity given by HMScore in pKd units The 7th column binding affinity given by HSScore in pKd units The 8th column average binding affinity in pKd units from all of the enabled scoring functions The last column name of the molecule as extracted from the Mol2 file This table is a standard space parsed text file you can use any spreadsheet program such as Excel to load this table Note that the format of this table has changed a little bit from the previous versions of X Score X Score also allows you to extract the best ranked ligand molecules and save each of them in a separate Mol2 file for further analysis The next two parameters in the input file are designed for this purpose NUMBER OF HITS the number of top hits you would like to extract from the LIGAND MOL2 FILE Each molecule will be output to a separate Mol2 file named after its ranking e g No1 mol2 No2 mol2 and etc If you do not want to extract any hits simply leave this parameter as zero HITS DIRECTORY specify a directory to dump the top hits If you are a user of SYBYL we suggest you to add the suffix mdb to the name of the directory e g hits mdb In this way the directory will be recognized by SYBYL as a molecular database and can be loaded directly into a SYBYL spreadsheet A newly added option in version 1 2 is OUTPUT LOG FILE which lists detailed scoring information for all of the top ligand molecules that have been selected and extracted click here to view an example For each molecule it 1 gives general properties such as name formula and molecular weight 2 lists in a table the contribution of each atom to each term in each scoring function and the binding scores dissected onto each atom and 3 gives the overall binding scores of the molecule and scoring functions enabled in scoring This log file greatly helps the users to interpret the structure affinity relationships of the scored molecules Note that OUTPUT LOG FILE is also optional If you set OUTPUT LOG FILE as none or simply comment out that line X Score will not create this file Another parameter for interpreting results is SHOW ATOM BIND SCORE It may be set to YES or NO If it is set to YES the program will write atomic binding scores as atomic partial charges in the Mol2 file for each of the top ligand molecules that have been selected and extracted Thus you can view them directly in a graphics software such as Sybyl by displaying atomic charges This method offers a more vivid way for inspecting the structure affinity relationships of the scored molecules Illustration of Atomic Binding Score in pKd units 4 Parameters for setting scoring functions As we have mentioned in the Introduction section there are three scoring functions implemented in X Score i e HPScore HMScore and HSScore You can find three switches in the input file i e APPLY HPSCORE APPLY HMSCORE and APPLY HSSCORE You may set any of them as YES or NO to enable the scoring function you like in computation If more than one scoring function are enabled X Score will adopt the consensus scoring strategy and rank all of the ligand molecules according to their average binding scores If all of the three scoring functions are switched on typically X Score can process 1 molecules per hour on an SGI Octane2 R12 36 MHz workstation All of the three scoring functions were calibrated with a large set of protein ligand complexes with known binding constants In X Score there are a default set of coefficients weight factors for each term in each scoring function which were derived from regression Started from version 1 2 the users are allowed to set those weight factors themselves For the HPScore function the weight factors for van der Waals interaction VDW hydrogen bonding HB hydrophobic interaction HP and frozen rotor RT are set by HPSCORE CVDW HPSCORE CHB HPSCORE CHP and HPSCORE CRT respectively HPSCORE C is a regression constant Similarly for the HMScore function the five weight factors are set by HMSCORE CVDW HMSCORE CHB HMSCORE CHM HMSCORE CRT and HMSCORE C while for the HSSCore function the five weight factors are set by HSSCORE CVDW HSSCORE CHB HSSCORE CHS HSSCORE CRT and HSSCORE C These newly added parameters give the users the greatest flexibility in applying X Score The users are now able to emphasize or underscore certain types of interactions between the protein and the ligand molecules which may lead to better structure affinity correlation of the ligand molecules under study For example you may knock out certain terms by setting their weight factors to zero Note that 1 all of the coefficient should be in pKd units 2 Positive coefficients indicate favorable contributions to the overall binding affinity while negative coefficients indicate unfavorable contributions 3 If you do not want to set any of the above parameters by yourself please comment out those lines by putting a as the first letter In this case you may not set them to or none because it is misleading If you do not set coefficients by yourself X Score will use the default values 5 Parameters for setting chemical rules One of the major applications of X Score is virtual library screening Beside ranking all of the candidate molecules according to their binding scores X Score allows the users to pre screening the given molecules with some molecular properties including molecular weight octanol water partition coefficient logP and number of H bond donor and acceptor atoms This is also well known as Lipinski rules for drug likeness judgment in the area of drug discovery Many studies have suggested that by applying such chemical rules false positives observed in virtual screening can be effectively reduced There are seven parameters in the input file to set such chemical rules APPLY CHEMICAL RULES Whether or not to apply chemical rules to pre screen the ligands It can be set to YES or NO MAXIMAL MOLECULAR WEIGH upper limit of the allowed molecular weight MINIMAL MOLECULAR WEIGHT lower limit of the allowed molecular weight MAXIMAL LOGP upper limit of the allowed octanol water partition coefficient LogP MINIMAL LOGP lower limit of the allowed octanol water partition coefficient LogP MAXIMAL HB ATOM upper limit of the allowed total number of H bonding donor and acceptor atoms MINIMAL HB ATOM lower limit of the allowed total number of H bonding donor and acceptor atoms A general purposed set of these chemical rules could be molecular weight between 2 to 6 LogP between 1 and 6 Number of H bonding atoms below 8 Here the logP values are calculated by using the XLOGP2 algorithm Note that if you have chosen YES for APPLY CHEMICAL RULES molecules that violate any of the chemical rules above will be skipped in binding score computation and receive a score of zero 6 The shortcut to run X Score The standard way for running X Score which has been described above is suitable for scoring multiple ligand molecules against a given target protein This is typically seen in a virtual library screening application Sometimes the user just wants to score one or some ligand molecule against its target protein and get a quick feedback of its binding score X Score provides a shortcut for this purpose the synopsis is a little different from the previous versions of X Score a flag of score is required now xscore score the protein PDB file the ligand Mol2 file If a cofactor molecule exists xscore score the protein PDB file the cofactor Mol2 file the ligand Mol2 file In such cases the following parameters are automatically set by the program as APPLY HPSCORE YES APPLY HMSCORE YES APPLY HSSCORE YES APPLY CHEMICAL RULES NO The results will be printed on the screen The input ligand Mol2 file may contain single or multiple molecules Upon the completeness of computation a log file named as xscore log will be created under your working directory recording detailed scoring information of each scored molecule Content Introduction Download Installation Usage Utilities Trouble

The \r\nstructure could be either experimentally determined or modeled by a docking \r\nprogram. Since most today's molecular docking programs  keep the protein \r\nstructure rigid \r\nwhile docking the ligand molecules, for the sake of efficient computation, X-Score requires the protein and the \r\nligand molecules\r\nto be stored in two separate files. </font>The protein is required to be stored \r\nin a PDB file, and the ligand molecules should be stored \r\nin a Mol2 \r\nfile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#000000\">The parameter </font><font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">RECEPTOR_PDB_FILE</font><font color=\"#000000\"> specifies the \r\npath and the name of the PDB file that stores the protein \r\nmolecule. To prepare this PDB file: (1) Remove any ligand molecule or other \r\norganic cofactors. (2) If a metal ion resides in the binding site and is \r\nbelieved to be important for ligand binding, keep it as part of the protein. \r\nX-Score considers this kind of metal ions explicitly in computation. According \r\nto PDB convention, a metal ion should be described by a line started by &quot;HETATM&quot;. (3) \r\nFor water molecules, you may keep them in the PDB file \r\n(also in the HETATM section). However, X-Score will not consider them in \r\ncomputation. (4) Remember to add hydrogen atoms. X-Score only needs polar \r\nhydrogen atoms on the protein in computation. But adding all of the hydrogen \r\natoms (polar and non-polar) will not hurt. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Started from version 1.2, an additional utility, &quot;<font color=\"#0000FF\">FixPDB</font>&quot;, \r\nhas been implemented in X-Score to help users to prepare the input PDB file \r\ncorrectly.

One thing</font> should be kept in mind is: the ligand \r\nmolecules must be pre-docked into the binding pocket of the target protein. X-Score \r\nwill not do docking for you --- it only calculates the \r\nbinding scores of given protein-ligand complexes. Also, please make sure that the \r\ndocked ligand molecules are saved in the same coordinate system as the protein \r\nmolecule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#000000\">Since the Mol2 format is defined by \r\nTripos, naturally we recommend SYBYL for \r\npreparing all Mol2 files. Other molecular modeling software may support the Mol2 \r\nformat as well. There are also some programs, such as Babel, which are  designed for converting different formats. However, our experience is that such \r\n \r\nconversion is not always flawless. To prepare the ligand molecules \r\ncorrectly: (1) Please try your best to correctly set the atom types and bond types \r\naccording to the Tripos conventions. (2) All hydrogen atoms (polar and \r\nnon-polar) need to be added to \r\nthe ligand molecules. (3) Atomic charges are not necessary for X-Score \r\ncomputation. (4) If there are multiple ligand \r\nmolecules, all of them should be packed one \r\nafter one in one file. This is often referred as a &quot;multiple&quot; Mol2 file. Since \r\nhandling a very large file will probably slow down your computer significantly, \r\nwe do not recommend to pack too many molecules in one file. A generally \r\nacceptable ceiling is 100,000 molecules (typically several hundred MB in size). \r\nIf you have to process more molecules, you may want to break them into several \r\nMol2 files and run X-Score respectively for each of them .</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Started from version 1.2, an additional utility, &quot;<font color=\"#0000FF\">FixMol2</font>&quot;, \r\nhas been implemented in X-Score to help users to prepare their Mol2 files \r\ncorrectly. Once you have finished the basic editing work described in the \r\nprevious paragraph, please use this utility to further process your Mol2 files.\r\n<a href=\"utility.html#subject_3\">Detailed description of the FixMol2 utility is \r\ngiven on the next page. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">An additional parameter added in version 1.2 is\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">REFERENCE_MOL2_FILE</font>. It specifies a \r\nligand molecule bound to the protein. This molecule will be used as a reference \r\nto define the binding pocket. All of the residues within 10 angstrom \r\nfrom any part of this molecule are defined as pocket residues and will be \r\nconsidered in scoring. If you already know any experimental complex structure of \r\nthe protein you are studying, using the ligand observed in that structure as \r\nthis reference molecule is a good idea. Or you can dock a proper molecule into \r\nthe binding pocket on the protein, and make sure it occupies all the important \r\nparts of the binding pocket. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Note that REFERENCE_MOL2_FILE is optional. If you do not want \r\nto set a reference molecule, you may set this parameter as &quot;none&quot; or comment \r\nout this line by putting a &quot;#&quot; sign as the first \r\nletter on that line. In such cases, X-Score will use the first molecule saved in \r\nthe LIGAND_MOL2_FILE<font color=\"#000000\"> for defining binding pocket. Of course the \r\ndownside of this approach is that it may not define the binding pocket as \r\nprecisely as the one using a proper reference molecule.</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Another parameter is\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">COFACTOR_MOL2_FILE</font>. Sometimes there is an organic cofactor \r\nbound together with the \r\nligand molecule inside the binding pocket, such as CoA, NADH, and etc., and you \r\nmay want to keep it at its place when computing binding affinities of the ligand molecules. \r\nIn X-Score. you are allowed to supply such a cofactor molecule as part of the \r\nprotein. Since \r\nthis kind of cofactors are usually not formed by \r\nany standard building blocks, the PDB format is not proper for them. \r\nFor instead, you can save the cofactor molecule in Mol2 format and specify its \r\npath and name with the COFACTOR_MOL2_FILE parameter in the input file. \r\nPlease follow the instructions mentioned above to prepare this Mol2 file \r\ncorrectly. Also, make sure that this cofactor molecule shares the same coordinate \r\nsystem as the protein and the ligand molecules. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">COFACTOR_MOL2_FILE is also optional. You may set it as &quot;none&quot; \r\nor comment out that line if you do not want to supply a cofactor molecule. \r\nFinally, we would like to point out that, although there is no evidence that it \r\ncannot, X-Score was not originally calibrated to compute the binding affinity of \r\na given ligand when a cofactor molecule exists. Applying X-Score to such cases \r\nis up to your own choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font size=\"3\"><strong><a name=\"subject_3\">3.

If you set \r\nOUTPUT_LOG_FILE as &quot;none&quot; or simply comment out that line, X-Score will not \r\ncreate this file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Another parameter for interpreting  results is\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">SHOW_ATOM_BIND_SCORE</font>. It \r\nmay be set to &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;. \r\nIf it is set to &quot;YES&quot;, the program will write atomic binding scores as \r\natomic partial charges in the Mol2 file for each of the top ligand molecules \r\nthat have been selected and extracted. Thus you can view them directly in a \r\ngraphics software, such as Sybyl, by displaying atomic charges. This method \r\noffers a more vivid way for inspecting the structure-affinity relationships of \r\nthe scored molecules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"abs.gif\" width=\"559\" height=\"362\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#000080\">Illustration of Atomic Binding Score (in \r\n<i>pKd</i> units)</font></p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<strong><a name=\"subject_4\">4. Parameters for setting scoring functions</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#000000\">As we have mentioned\r\nin the <em>Introduction</em> section, there are three scoring functions \r\nimplemented in X-Score, i.e. HPScore, HMScore, and HSScore. You can find three \r\nswitches in the input file, i.e. </font><font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_HPSCORE</font><font color=\"#000000\">, </font><font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_HMSCORE</font><font color=\"#000000\">, and </font><font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_HSSCORE</font><font color=\"#000000\">. You may set any of them as &quot;</font>YES<font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">&quot; or &quot;</font>NO<font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">&quot; to enable the scoring function you like in computation. If more than one \r\nscoring function are enabled, X-Score will adopt the consensus scoring strategy \r\nand rank all of the ligand molecules according to their average binding scores. \r\nIf all of the three scoring functions are switched on, typically X-Score can \r\nprocess ~10,000 molecules per hour on an SGI Octane2/R12000/360MHz\r\nworkstation.</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">All of the three scoring functions were calibrated with a \r\nlarge set of protein-ligand complexes with known binding constants. In X-Score, \r\nthere are a default set of coefficients (weight factors) for each term in each \r\nscoring function, which were derived from regression. Started from version 1.2, the users are allowed to set those \r\nweight factors themselves. For the HPScore function, the weight factors for van der \r\nWaals interaction (VDW), hydrogen bonding (HB), hydrophobic interaction (HP), \r\nand frozen rotor (RT) are set by <font color=\"#0000FF\">HPSCORE_CVDW</font>,\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">HPSCORE_CHB</font>, <font color=\"#0000FF\">HPSCORE_CHP</font>, \r\nand <font color=\"#0000FF\">HPSCORE_CRT</font>, respectively.\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">HPSCORE_C0</font> is a regression constant. Similarly, for \r\nthe HMScore function, the five weight factors are set by<font color=\"#0000FF\"> \r\nHMSCORE_CVDW</font>, <font color=\"#0000FF\">HMSCORE_CHB,</font>\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">HMSCORE_CHM</font>, <font color=\"#0000FF\">HMSCORE_CRT</font>, \r\nand <font color=\"#0000FF\">HMSCORE_C0</font>; while for the HSSCore function, the \r\nfive weight factors are set by <font color=\"#0000FF\">HSSCORE_CVDW</font>,\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">HSSCORE_CHB</font>, <font color=\"#0000FF\">HSSCORE_CHS</font>,\r\n<font color=\"#0000FF\">HSSCORE_CRT</font>, and <font color=\"#0000FF\">HSSCORE_C0</font>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">These newly added parameters give the users the greatest \r\nflexibility in applying X-Score. The users are now able to emphasize or \r\nunderscore certain types of interactions between the protein and the ligand \r\nmolecules, which may lead to better structure-affinity correlation of the ligand \r\nmolecules under study. For example, you may &quot;knock out&quot; certain terms by \r\nsetting their weight factors to zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Note that: (1) all of the coefficient should be in <i>pKd</i> \r\nunits. (2) Positive coefficients indicate favorable contributions to the overall \r\nbinding affinity; while negative coefficients indicate unfavorable \r\ncontributions. (3) If you do not want to set any of the above parameters by \r\nyourself, please comment out those lines by putting a &quot;#&quot; as the first letter. In this \r\ncase, you may not set them to &quot;0&quot; or &quot;none&quot; because it is misleading. If you do \r\nnot set coefficients by yourself, X-Score will use the default values.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><a name=\"subject_5\">5. Parameters for setting \r\nchemical rules</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">One of the major applications of X-Score is virtual library \r\nscreening. Beside ranking all of the candidate molecules according to their \r\nbinding scores, X-Score allows the users to pre-screening the given molecules with \r\nsome molecular properties, including molecular weight, octanol-water partition \r\ncoefficient (logP), and number of H-bond donor and acceptor atoms. <font color=\"#000000\">This is also well known as &quot;Lipinski rules&quot;\r\nfor drug-likeness judgment in the area of drug discovery. Many studies have suggested that, by applying such chemical \r\nrules, false positives observed in virtual screening can be effectively reduced. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#000000\">There are seven parameters in the input \r\nfile to set such chemical rules:</font></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_CHEMICAL_RULES</font><font color=\"#000000\">:\r\nWhether or not to apply chemical rules to pre-screen the ligands. It can be set \r\n  to &quot;</font>YES<font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">&quot; or &quot;</font>NO<font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">&quot;</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">MAXIMAL_MOLECULAR_WEIGH</font><font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">: upper limit of the allowed molecular weight;</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">MINIMAL_MOLECULAR_WEIGHT</font><font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">: lower limit of the allowed molecular weight;</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">MAXIMAL_LOGP</font><font color=\"#000000\">: \r\nupper limit of the allowed octanol/water partition coefficient (LogP);</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">MINIMAL_LOGP</font><font color=\"#000000\">: \r\nlower limit of the allowed octanol/water partition coefficient (LogP);</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">MAXIMAL_HB_ATOM</font><font color=\"#000000\">:\r\nupper limit of the allowed total number of H-bonding donor and acceptor atoms;</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">MINIMAL_HB_ATOM</font><font color=\"#000000\">:\r\nlower limit of the allowed total number of H-bonding donor and acceptor atoms;</font></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">A general-purposed\r\nset of these chemical rules could be: molecular weight between\r\n200 to 600; LogP between 1 and 6; Number of H-bonding atoms below 8. Here, the logP values are\r\ncalculated by using the<a href=\"refs.html\"> </a></font>\r\n<a href=\"refs.html#refs_4\">XLOGP2 algorithm<font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">. </font></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Note that if <font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">you have chosen &quot;YES&quot; for </font><align=\"justify\"></align=\"justify\">\r\n  APPLY_CHEMICAL_RULES<font\r\ncolor=\"#000000\">,  molecules that violate any of the \r\nchemical rules above will be skipped in binding score computation  and \r\nreceive a score of zero. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><a name=\"subject_6\">6. The shortcut to run X-Score</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">The standard way for running X-Score, which has been \r\ndescribed above, is suitable for scoring multiple ligand molecules against a \r\ngiven target protein. This is typically seen in a virtual library screening \r\napplication. Sometimes the user just wants to score one (or some)  ligand \r\nmolecule \r\nagainst its target protein and get a quick feedback of its binding score. X-Score provides a shortcut for this \r\npurpose (the synopsis is a little different from the previous versions of \r\nX-Score: a flag of &quot;-score&quot; is required now):</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>xscore&nbsp; -score</b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nthe_protein_PDB_file</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>the_ligand_Mol2_file</i></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">If a cofactor molecule exists:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>xscore &nbsp;-score </b><i>&nbsp;the_protein_PDB_file</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>\r\nthe_cofactor_Mol2_file&nbsp; the_ligand_Mol2_file</i></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">In such cases, the following parameters are automatically set \r\nby the program as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_HPSCORE</font><font color=\"#000000\"> \r\n= YES</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_HMSCORE</font><font color=\"#000000\"> = YES</font></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_HSSCORE</font> = YES</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <p align=\"left\"><align=\"justify\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">APPLY_CHEMICAL_RULES</font> = NO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">The results will be printed on the screen. The input ligand \r\nMol2 file may contain single or multiple molecules. Upon the completeness of \r\ncomputation, a log file, named as &quot;xscore.log&quot;, will be created under your \r\nworking directory  recording detailed scoring information of each scored \r\nmolecule.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"3\" align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"><a href=\"index.html\">[Content]</a></font><font\r\nsize=\"3\"> </font><a href=\"intro.html\"><font size=\"3\">[Introduction]</font></a><font\r\nsize=\"3\"> </font><a href=\"download.html\"><font size=\"3\">[Download]</font></a><font\r\nsize=\"3\"> <a href=\"install.html\">[Installation]</a> [Usage]\r\n<a href=\"utility.html\">[Utilities]</a> <a href=\"trouble.html\">[Trouble\r\nShooting]</a> <a href=\"refs.html\">[References]</a></font></p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "id": 37029.0}
