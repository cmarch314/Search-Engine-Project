The ICS grid contains groups of both public and research distributed computing clusters These clusters are unified by the Sun Grid Engine SGE where jobs are submitted scheduled and dispatched according to available resources Jobs may embed requests for certain types of resources or these can be requested at time of submission Your job will be queued and dispatched when the appropriate resources are available Research clusters are owned by various faculty members and have dedicated nodes to run their computing jobs Trying to submit jobs directly to these clusters will result in jobs being rejected or access being denied unless appropriate permissions are previously granted The ICS grid also has public clusters for general use These have wall clock limits so that the general public may have a turn on the grid Below is a listing of the public queues Public QueueOSRuntime LimitSlots12hour qCentOS 6 RHEL 6 x86 6412 hours4815day qCentOS 6 RHEL 6 x86 6415 days48 For a list of all queues you can query SGE qconf sql To get details on a particular queue such as time nodes access etc qconf sq 12hour q How do I request an account All ICS accounts can access the public queues Contact helpdesk in order to get access to research queues How do I access my account Linux Solaris MacOS To access the grid simply login via ssh since these systems have ssh installed by default ssh Y icsusername openlab ics uci edu Windows On Windows use the free PuTTY application or one of these alternatives Telnet access is NOT available If you use ssh without the Y or X option you will not be able to view X11 graphics I am logged in now what Once you are logged in you have access to a shell for which you can access ICS computing resources such as our software stack along with the grid In order to access these you must know a few commands before you begin module load sge Let s go over the command above The module command allows you to load specific software applications out of the software stack In this case the application is SGE This will setup essential environment variables in order to run the commands provided by sge You may edit your shell rc files to automatically load sge if that is your primary use or even if you find it convenient so you do not have to run it at every login There are no additional resources taken up if you decide not to use it even with the module loaded as the command will only modify your environment variables For more on modules and our software stack please visit our module page I loaded SGE what commands can I run For starters the first command to get accustomed to is qstat If you run qstat alone you will see nothing for the first time because by default it displays the status for submitted jobs To get a full listing run qstat f Once you submit a job you will be given a job id to track the detail of job completion qstat j job id This command will give you better detail as to why your job is sitting in the queue waiting to be dispatched Resources may be busy so you will have to wait and sit tight If your job sits in the queue for too long especially in our 12 hour or 15 day long public queues please email helpdesk to assist you in looking at the queues more thoroughly You can also delete a job using its id number qdel job id Now let s submit your first job The simple method is to not request any particular resource constraints such as memory platform or SGE queues qsub auto sge 6 2u5 examples jobs sleeper sh This simple script once dispatched will run on an SGE selected host and sleep for a given number of seconds This exciting script is used to test that the basic SGE scheduling is working It is a good idea to test and run it at times when your custom scripts and or applications refuse to run You can test particular SGE queues by specifying a queue request during submission as follows qsub q 12hour q auto sge 6 2u5 examples jobs sleeper sh There are various requests that can be made You can read about them in the man pages The usage page is a valuable resource for your routine tasks of using the grid more effectively For example you may use job arrays for scenarios that require running several identical jobs which will work on different datasets You would submit a job array of an appropriate size to do that Otherwise we would bombard the scheduler with hundreds of thousands of jobs This could result in bringing down the scheduler and you explaining to your colleagues that you single handedly brought SGE down as they are on a deadline How do I get files scripts to and from my account For systems managed by Computing Support you will find that your UNIX home directory has already been mounted via NFS All of our nodes on the grid automount your home directories as well as our software stack mentioned above via the use of modules If this is your case then you are already off on the right foot and have it easy when it comes to transporting files to and from your ICS account for use on the grid For systems not managed by ICS the easiest way of transporting files is using secure copy i e scp Besides the command line scp utility bundled with all Linux Solaris and Mac hosts there are GUI clients for MacOS and Windows and of course Linux If you have large collections of files or large individual files that change only partially you might be interested in using rsync as well For Windows users we recommend the free WinSCP application which gives you a graphical interface for SCP SFTP and FTP Machines within the Windows UCI ICS domain will already have their H drive mounted so you can just drag and drop directly to your home directory For Mac OS X users we recommend the free though oddly named Cyberduck application which provides graphical file browsing via FTP SCP SFTP WebDAV and even Amazon S3 Macs also have access to your UNIX home directory so you can easily drag and drop files For Linux and Solaris users we recommend utilizing the built in capabilities of KDE s Swiss army knife browser Konqueror or twin panel file manager Krusader Both support the secure file browser kio plugin called fish Advanced users should read the document How to Move Data which discusses in detail how to transfer large amounts of data over the network Again if you have a Linux or Solaris install from ICS you will have your home directory mounted and accessible from your desktop How do I use the grid There are basically two good uses for SGE The Sun Grid Engine scheduler controls all the access to the grid s computing nodes All jobs must use the qsub or qrsh commands which submit jobs to the grid in an orderly fashion There are policies in place to prevent a single user from dominating the machine by flooding the queue with jobs particularly a 12 hour and 14 day wallclock limit for longer jobs on our public queues THIS SYSTEM IS NOT FOOLPROOF Please be courteous and run as few simultaneous jobs as possible particularly if you notice that there is a lot of usage with the qstat command You can check the status of the batch queue backlog using the qstat and qhost commands For more information see the section on Monitoring and Controlling Jobs from the wiki Send email to helpdesk ics uci edu if you have complaints about your job turnaround or if you need special scheduling considerations to meet a project deadline Batch submission Use the qsub command to submit a job script to the grid A job script consists of UNIX directives comments and executable statements It is important to remember that all the commands in the job script execute serially on the node that runs your script TIP When your script begins execution the working directory is your home directory Use the cwd option with qsub to use the current working directory wherever you currently are Output and error will be directed wherever you happen to be allowing for a cleaner environment Otherwise stdout and stderr go to your home directory SGE provides an abundant number of examples for you to start out with You can find them located at SGE ROOT examples or just Google SGE examples and you will have plenty of references There are several things to look out for when using batch submissions Submitting a large set of jobs This has the affect of saturating the scheduler to a crawl and at times making it inaccessible to you and everyone else on the grid The best solution is to use job arrays If you chain jobs remember to check the status of the previous job before spawning another qsub This will prevent the system from flooding the scheduler with failed jobs Remember that for your convenience we automounted your home directory along with our software stack Please be aware that if you flood the scheduler with jobs that mount a software stack or access data from your home directory your scripts will fail trying to look up a file or directory If you encounter this please make sure to make create more robust scripts by adding random timers or give the lookup some time to return your mounts Interactive The submission of interactive jobs instead of batch jobs is useful in situations where a job requires your direct input to influence the job results Such situations are typical for X Windows applications or for tasks in which your interpretation of immediate results is required to steer further processing You can create interactive jobs in three ways qlogin An rlogin like session that is started on a host selected by the Grid Engine software qrsh The equivalent of the standard UNIX rsh facility A command is executed remotely on a host selected by the Grid Engine system If no command is specified a remote rlogin session is started on a remote host qsh An xterm that is displayed from the machine that is running the job The display is set corresponding to your specification or to the setting of the DISPLAY environment variable If the DISPLAY variable is not set and if no display destination is defined the Grid Engine system directs the xterm to the screen of the X server on the host from which the job was submitted The default handling of interactive jobs differs from the handling of batch jobs Interactive jobs are not queued if the jobs cannot be executed when they are submitted When a job is not queued immediately the user is notified that the cluster is currently too busy You can change this default behavior with the now no option to qsh qlogin and qrsh If you use this option interactive jobs are queued like batch jobs When you use the now yes option batch jobs that are submitted with qsub can also be handled like interactive jobs Such batch jobs are either dispatched for running immediately or they are rejected Where can I get more information on grid computing The best resource is always the user documentation Your peers are the next best source since they may already have experience using the grid for what may be the very purpose you might need Where do I report problems Please contact helpdesk if you have problems accessing the grid or if there is a failure beyond normal script logic failures We are here to make sure that the grid is operational and that you have access so that you can make full use of the grid When emailing please articulate what problem s you are experiencing what scripts you are trying to run and how you are submitting them to the grid Please copy paste any relevant error messages This will help us troubleshoot the problem in a timely fashion Copyright Inquiries UCI Directory Intranet icswebmaster Updated April 14 2 14", "_id":

Macs also have access to your UNIX home directory, so you can easily drag and drop files.</p>\n<p>For Linux and Solaris users, we recommend utilizing the built-in capabilities of KDE's Swiss-army-knife browser Konqueror or twin-panel file manager Krusader. Both support the secure file browser kio-plugin called fish. Advanced users should read the document <a href=\"http://moo.nac.uci.edu/%7ehjm/HOWTO_move_data.html\" title=\"How to Move Data\">How to Move Data</a>, which discusses in detail how to transfer large amounts of data over the network. Again if you have a Linux or Solaris install from ICS, you will have your home directory mounted and accessible from your desktop.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>How do I use the grid?</h3>\n<p>There are basically two good uses for SGE. The Sun Grid Engine scheduler controls all the access to the grid's computing nodes. All jobs must use the qsub or qrsh commands, which submit jobs to the grid in an orderly fashion. There are policies in place to prevent a single user from dominating the machine by flooding the queue with jobs, particularly a 12-hour and 14-day wallclock limit&#160;for longer jobs on our public queues. THIS SYSTEM IS NOT FOOLPROOF. Please be courteous and run as few simultaneous jobs as possible, particularly if you notice that there is a lot of usage (with the qstat command).</p>\n<p>You can check the status of the batch queue backlog using the qstat and qhost commands. For more information see the section on Monitoring and Controlling Jobs from the wiki.</p>\n<p>Send email to helpdesk@ics.uci.edu if you have complaints about your job turnaround or if you need special scheduling considerations to meet a project deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Batch submission</strong></p>\n<p>Use the qsub command to submit a job script to the grid. A job script consists of UNIX directives, comments, and executable statements. It is important to remember that all the commands in the job script execute serially on the node that runs your script.</p>\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong>&#160;When your script begins execution the working directory is your home directory. Use the -cwd option with qsub to use the current working directory (wherever you currently are). Output and error will be directed wherever you happen to be, allowing for a cleaner environment. Otherwise stdout and stderr go to your home directory.</p>\n<p>SGE provides an abundant number of examples for you to start out with. You can find them located at $SGE_ROOT/examples, or just Google \"SGE examples\" and you will have plenty of references.</p>\n<p>There are several things to look out for when using batch submissions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submitting a large set of jobs. This has the affect of saturating the scheduler to a crawl and at times making it inaccessible to you and&#160;everyone else on the grid. The best solution is to use job arrays.</li>\n<li>If you chain jobs, remember to check the status of the previous job before spawning another qsub. This will prevent the system from flooding the scheduler with failed jobs.</li>\n<li>Remember that for your convenience we automounted your home directory along with our software stack. Please be aware that if you flood the scheduler with jobs that mount a software stack or access data from your home directory, your scripts will fail trying to look up a file or directory. If you encounter this, please make sure to make create more robust scripts by adding random timers or give the lookup some time to return your mounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Interactive</strong></p>\n<p>The submission of interactive jobs instead of batch jobs is useful in situations where a job requires your direct input to influence the job results. Such situations are typical for X Windows applications or for tasks in which your interpretation of immediate results is required to steer further processing.</p>\n<p>You can create interactive jobs in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>qlogin &#8211; An rlogin-like session that is started on a host selected by the Grid Engine software.</li>\n<li>qrsh &#8211; The equivalent of the standard UNIX rsh facility. A command is executed remotely on a host selected by the Grid Engine system. If no command is specified, a remote rlogin session is started on a remote host.</li>\n<li>qsh &#8211; An xterm that is displayed from the machine that is running the job. The display is set corresponding to your specification or to the setting of the DISPLAY environment variable. If the DISPLAY variable is not set, and if no display destination is defined, the Grid Engine system directs the xterm to the 0.0 screen of the X server on the host from which the job was submitted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The default handling of interactive jobs differs from the handling of batch jobs. Interactive jobs are not queued if the jobs cannot be executed when they are submitted. When a job is not queued immediately, the user is notified that the cluster is currently too busy.</p>\n<p>You can change this default behavior with the -now no option to qsh, qlogin, and qrsh. If you use this option, interactive jobs are queued like batch jobs. When you use the -now yes option, batch jobs that are submitted with qsub can also be handled like interactive jobs. Such batch jobs are either dispatched for running immediately, or they are rejected.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Where can I get more information on grid computing?</h3>\n<p>The best resource is always the <a href=\"http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/manuals.html\" title=\"Man Pages\">user documentation</a>. Your peers are the next best source since they may already have experience using the grid for what may be the very purpose you might need.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Where do I report problems?</h3>\n<p>Please contact <a href=\"../contact/helpdesk.php\">helpdesk</a> if you have problems accessing the grid or if there is a failure beyond normal script logic failures. We are here to make sure that the grid is operational and that you have access so that you can make full use of the grid. When emailing please articulate what problem(s) you are experiencing, what scripts you are trying to run, and how you are submitting them to the grid. Please copy/paste any relevant error messages. This will help us troubleshoot the problem in a timely fashion.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a> |\n   \n   <!-- <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/sitemap.php\">Site Map</a> | -->\n \n  <a href=\"mailto: i%63%73%77%65%62m%61s%74%65r@%69c%73%2e%75c%69%2eedu\">icswebmaster</a> |\nUpdated: \nApril 14 2014</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 7613.0}
