and I\r\n  am happy to improve my code based on your observations -nothing is perfect).\r\nA good programmer typically makes elegant use of the required language\r\n  features, resulting in smaller, more elegant code.\r\n<p>\r\nAll downloadable projects are listed alphabetically; you can also search this\r\n  page for keywords.\r\nAll are zip files, so unzip them first.\r\nMost project files require the\r\n  Download: <a href=\"../common/online.html\">standard course library</a>\r\n  which contains a variety of useful modules.\r\nIf you followed the Eclipse installation instructions, you should have already\r\n  created the <b>courselib</b> folder in your workspace and populated it with\r\n  these modules.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/collatz.zip\">Collatz Conjecture</a><br>\r\nThe Collatz conjecture states: starting with any positive number, repeat the\r\n  process \"If it is even, halve it; if it is odd, multiply it by three and\r\n  add one\" and eventually the remaining value reduces to one.\r\nNo one has been able to prove this conjecture, but a short script allows us\r\n  to investigate it (and others have examined billions of different values\r\n  and found no counterexamples).\r\nIt is interesting to observe the number of cycles required to reduce the\r\n  starting number to 1, looking for a pattern.\r\nThis script is highlighted in the\r\n  <a href=\"../common/debugger/debugger.pdf\">debugger handout</a>.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/craps.zip\">\r\n  Craps Statistics</a><br>\r\nThis script prompts the user for the number of craps games to play (craps\r\n  is a dice game whose rules are explained in the block comment at the top\r\n  of this script).\r\nIt then simulates that many games of craps, printing the number (and percentage)\r\n  of wins, losses, dice throws (and average dice throws per game), elapsed\r\n  time, and game playing speed.\r\nThis script is used inthe problem set for the\r\n  <a href=\"../common/debugger/debugger.pdf\">debugger handout</a>.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/retester.zip\">\r\n  Regular Expression Tester</a><br>\r\nThis script is a complicated driver for testing methods in the <b>re</b>\r\n  (Regular Expression) module.\r\nThere are boths simple and complex features dealing with entering patterns\r\n  and testing for matches, searches, finds, substitutes (with replacements),\r\n  and splits.\r\nRegular Expressions are tersely illustrated in a\r\n  <a href=\"lectures/re.txt\">lecture</a>.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDownload: <a href=\"programs/sid_uid.zip\">\r\n  Translate Student ID -> Unique/Spreadsheet ID</a><br>\r\nThis script translates a UCI student's ID (must be an integer) into\r\n  the ID appearing on the grading spreadsheet for that student.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 3117.0}
