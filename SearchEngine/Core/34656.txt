The Resource\n&gt;&gt; element is one such syntax.\n&gt;\n&gt;Separate out the problem of\n&gt;  a) construct a URL for a previous version of a resource\n&gt;     given the current version of a resource and information\n&gt;     about the server's versioning system\n&gt;  b) determining from two URLs what their version relationship\n&gt;     might be.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think it's reasonable to use URL-decoration for (a) and not for (b).\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe it's OK if the only way you can accomplish (b) is to retrieve\n&gt;attributes of the actual resources, and not their URLs.\n\nFair enough. ?version=xxx seems reasonable for (a)\n\nDan\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0027.html\">David J.
