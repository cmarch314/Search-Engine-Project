The focii of this project are<br />\n    1) HCI design<br />\n    2) rapid prototyping<br />\n    3) remixing web services</p>\n  <p><br />\n  As long as your tool compiles, or is called from Javascript to Javascript, then it's okay. OpenLazlo compiled to Javascript, Yahoo UI, Google Web Toolkit, JQuery, Prototype, ext, are all fair game.  It's also okay to use server side support for your webpage, although ruby on rails is about as far as I want you to go in that direction. (Again, flash is too far)</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Here is a nice article on Dr. Dobb's about a professional web team that evaluated some of these technologies.

It should work something like this:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>You pick four target sizes (like 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, and 4 cm square) </li>\n    <li>Write a program that draws them and let's you click on them.</li>\n    <li>Calculate the time from when the   shape appears to the time when the user clicks on it.\n      <ol>\n          <li>Record the information as (&lt;input device&gt;,&lt;time&gt;, &lt;distance&gt;, &lt;width&gt;)</li>\n        <li>Record the information from a bunch of user trials. 2 device, 4 </li>\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Enter those pairs into an Excel spreadsheet   (You can use Matlab or something else if you want) </li>\n        <li>Graph them as an XY scatter plot, with Time as the y axis and (D/W +1) as the x axis. </li>\n        <li>Make a &quot;best-fit&quot; linear model which captures the data. (In Excel this is &quot;add trendline&quot;)</li>\n        <li>Take the equation of the linear model (y = ax + b) and map them to the Fitt's law equation to figure out the constants.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>Complete the analysis</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>So the point is that you can't capture those constants in a program. You have to collect data and then figure out the constants which best match your data. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p><span class=\"style5\">4/4/2007</span></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><span class=\"style5\">For part one of assignment one, are we suposed to take a digital picture (digital photo) of ourselves by ourselves (like at home and not at the lab during class)? It was sort of unclear based on the assignment sheet and what you mentioned in class. </span>I would like a digital photo with your name on it so that I can recognize who you are more easily.  I don't really care where the photo is taken as long as it is recent and clear. The lab time (on 4/5) is primarily for the Human Research Tutorial, not for taking photos (although if you can figure out a way to take a picture at the lab, that's fine).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p><span class=\"style5\">3/30/2007</span></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><span class=\"style5\">Do I have to have the prerequisites for this course in order to take it? </span>: Yes </p>\n</div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ntry {\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-15170336-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n} catch(err) {}</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 32745.0}
