picnic table is square with four legs and I need to find a place on the hill where it will be stable with the top horizontal Is there necessarily such a position What assumptions can we make about the size of the table with respect to the minumum radius of curvature of the hill For example if the hill is very pointy and the table is pretty big then it seems like it would be hard to have the legs on the ground Instead the point of the hill would stick into the underside of the table hardly a stable situation Gene Stark The correct assumptions are that the legs are arbitrarily long but of the same length that the hill is given by a continuous non negative function defined inside a compact convex disk D and that the table is to be placed on the hill in the sense that its center lies over D Then

the points of the annulus as in if p x y is inside the Jordan curve out if p x y is outside the Jordan curve and on if it is on the curve Obviously what we want to find is a b for which a b and a b are both classified on Then for smooth curves the points near one boundary of the annulus are all classified in the points near the other boundary are all classified out and the points classified in and out are both open sets Without loss of generality let s say that the out points are along the outer boundary of the annulus Let S be the connected component of the points classified out near this boundary of the annulus and consider the set S union S This is a connected open set topologically a multiple punctured disk Consider the component of its boundary that contains the origin Some of the boundary points are cluster points of S in particular the point realizing the infimum of absolute values of points in S is such a boundary point and similarly some of the boundary points are cluster points of S So there must be a boundary point a b that is a cluster point of both S and S Note that a b must be strictly interior to the annulus since all points near the other boundary are in Since it is a cluster point of the out points but not an out point itself since it is on the boundary of an open set it must be an on point and similarly a b is also an on point QED It looks like the proof generalizes a little to curves such that at each point the left and right derivatives make an obtuse angle But it doesn t work for all Jordan curves for instance the equilateral triangle has both in

side of the wanted square i e one or the longest side of the wanted square is 2 p 2 q or more simply p q Note that at this point we are searching a square but not necessarily rectangular square The radius of a circle A which goes through the 2 edges or the corners of the wanted square with side 2 p is p squareroot 2 The centre of a circle A is somewhere perpendicular to the middle point of the sliding chord In other word the sliding side of the wanted square is tangent of the new circle B which touches the middle point of the wanted square Circle A and circle B has the same centre If we now let a circle B with radius p q roll inside the drawn smooth closed convex curve C 2 that was the result as the centre point of the wanted square traced out we have the third smooth closed convex curve C 3 for all the centre points of the circle with radius p squareroot 2 because it is at the perpendicular distance of radius p from curve C 2 Curve C 3 draws therefore all the centre points of circle A and circle B Certainly the circle A exists if p 2 is smaller than the longest diameter of closed curve C 1 and it touches at least two corners of the wanted square i e the ends of the sliding chord which was a side of the wanted square The circle B with radius p touches the middle point of the side of the wanted square i e curve C 2 with centre on C 3 Now if the circle A with the centre point on curve C 3 cuts the original smooth closed convex curve C 1 in 4 points we have found a square but not necessarily a rectangular square Anyway by choosing a certain length or p for the sliding chord it would be apparent that the centre of the circle A is found and also a kind of square is found Apparently if circle A with radius p sqrt 2 rolls on the outside of the smooth convex curve C 3 it is possible to draw a new smooth convex curve C 4 that is at the radius distance p sqrt 2 from the curve C 3 Iff now the curves C 1 and C 4 have four common point a square is found but not necessarily a rectangular square The common points of the curves C 4 and C 2 may help but the proof that the solution is a rectangular square is not so easy The above mentioned story how to find the centre of the circle A is not a proof I think it would be hopefully a method to find the proof for some p and for some curve C 1 The method and the proof that the wanted square is rectangular square is far away At least you may received a tip for further studies hopefully Tapio Original poster continues Now if the new closed curve has a perpendicular section with itself i e a knot point then there is a single

I made it up, but I don't\nexpect it to be original; I haven't read previous proofs of similar results.\n\nConsider the set of ordered pairs (x,y) of unequal points on the curve.\nTopologically, the ordered pairs form a torus, but the restriction that\nthey be unequal turns this into an open annulus.  We can embed this\nannulus geometrically as the set {(a,b): 1 &lt; a^2+b^2 &lt; 2} in such a way\nthat that swapping x and y corresponds to a 180degree rotation of the\nannulus: -(a,b) = (-a,-b)\n\nFor each such pair (x,y) let point p(x,y) denote the corner clockwise\nfrom x on a square having diagonal xy.  Classify the points of the\nannulus as \"in\" if p(x,y) is inside the Jordan curve, \"out\" if p(x,y) is\noutside the Jordan curve, and \"on\" if it is on the curve.  Obviously,\nwhat we want to find is (a,b) for which (a,b) and -(a,b) are both\nclassified \"on\".\n\nThen (for smooth curves) the points near one boundary of the annulus are\nall classified \"in\", the points near the other boundary are all\nclassified \"out\", and the points classified \"in\" and \"out\" are both open\nsets. Without loss of generality let's say that the \"out\" points are\nalong the outer boundary of the annulus.  Let S be the connected\ncomponent of the points classified \"out\" near this boundary of the\nannulus, and consider the set (S union -S).  This is a connected open\nset, topologically a multiple-punctured disk.  Consider the component of\nits boundary that contains the origin.  Some of the boundary points are\ncluster points of S (in particular, the point realizing the infimum of\nabsolute values of points in S is such a boundary point) and similarly\nsome of the boundary points are cluster points of -S.  So there must be\na boundary point (a,b) that is a cluster point of both S and -S.  Note\nthat (a,b) must be strictly interior to the annulus since all points\nnear the other boundary are \"in\".  Since it is a cluster point of the\n\"out\" points, but not an \"out\" point itself (since it is on the boundary\nof an open set) it must be an \"on\" point, and similarly -(a,b) is also\nan \"on\" point, QED.\n\nIt looks like the proof generalizes a little, to curves such that, at\neach point, the left and right derivatives make an obtuse angle.  But it\ndoesn't work for all Jordan curves; for instance the equilateral\ntriangle has both \"in\" and \"out\" points near both boundaries of the\nannulus.  In this particular case, there are only a constant number of\nmisclassified points, presumably easily enough handled, but one could\nimagine more monstrous examples in which the \"in\" and \"out\" points are\ndense on both boundaries.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           \"Tapio Hurme\" &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:hurmecom@dlc.fi\">hurmecom@dlc.fi</A>&gt;\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 2 Jul 1999 21:11:09 +0300\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: The Hardest Geometry Problem in the World\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nDavid's poster was inspiring.\n\nMaybe Holditch's theorem would help - this is just an idea:\n\"Take a smooth, closed convex curve and let a chord of constant lenght slide\naround it.

Therefore the centre of the circle draws the new closed\n|curve inside the original closed convex curve.The area between the two\n|curves is now pi*p^2 = pi*q^2.\n\nWell -of course the sliding chord would be the side of the wanted square,\ni.e. one (or the longest side) of the wanted square is 2*p=2*q or more\nsimply p+q. (Note that at this point we are searching a square but not\nnecessarily rectangular square.) The radius of a circle (A), which goes\nthrough the 2 edges or the corners of the wanted square with side 2*p, is\np*squareroot(2).\n\nThe centre of a circle (A) is \"somewhere\" perpendicular to the middle point\nof the sliding chord. In other word - the sliding side of the wanted square\nis tangent of the new circle (B), which touches the middle point of the\nwanted square. Circle (A) and circle (B) has the same centre.\n\nIf we now let a circle (B) with radius p=q roll inside the drawn smooth,\nclosed convex curve (C-2) that was the result as the centre point of the\nwanted square traced out, we have the third smooth, closed convex curve\n(C-3) for all the centre points of the circle with radius p*squareroot(2)\nbecause it is at the perpendicular distance of radius p from curve (C-2).\nCurve (C-3) draws therefore all the centre points of circle (A) and circle\n(B).\n.\nCertainly the circle (A) exists, if p/2 is smaller than the longest diameter\nof closed curve C-1, and it touches at least two corners of the wanted\nsquare, i.e. the ends of the sliding chord, which was a side of the wanted\nsquare.  The circle (B) with radius p touches the middle point of the side\nof the wanted square, i.e. curve (C-2) with centre on C-3.\n\nNow if the circle (A), with the centre point on curve C-3, cuts the original\nsmooth, closed convex curve C-1 in 4 points we have found a square, but not\nnecessarily a rectangular square.\nAnyway,  by choosing a certain length or p for the sliding chord, it would\nbe apparent that the centre of the circle (A) is found and also a kind of\nsquare is found.\n\nApparently, if circle (A) with radius p*sqrt(2) rolls on the outside of the\nsmooth convex curve C-3, it is possible to draw a new smooth convex curve\nC-4 that is at the radius distance (p*sqrt(2)) from the curve C-3. Iff now\nthe curves C-1 and C-4 have four common point, a square is found, but not\nnecessarily a rectangular square. The common points of the curves C-4 and\nC-2 may help, but the proof that the solution is a rectangular square is not\nso easy.\n\nThe above mentioned \"story\" how to find the centre of the circle (A) is not\na proof. I think it would be hopefully a method to find the proof for some p\nand for some curve C-1.\nThe method and the proof that the wanted square is rectangular square is far\naway.\n\nAt least - you may received a tip for further studies - hopefully.\n\nTapio\n\nOriginal poster continues:\n|Now,  if the new closed curve has a perpendicular section (with itself) ,\n|i.e. a knot-point, then there is a single point for the wanted square.\n|Therefore - If it is possible to proof that such a point exists as a\n|function of p or q, then the problem is proofed (?).\n|\n|Hopefully....\n|\n|Tapio\n|\n|David Eppstein wrote in message &lt;7lgd3g$ci5@euclid.ics.uci.edu&gt;...\n||Bob Silverman &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:bobs@rsa.com\">bobs@rsa.com</A>&gt; writes:\n||&gt; BTW, does anyone know if any progress has been made on the following\n||&gt; problem: On every Jordan curve there exists 4 points lying on the\n||&gt; vertices of a square.\n||\n||Last I heard it was still open, although some cases (e.g. sufficiently\n||smooth curves) have been solved.
