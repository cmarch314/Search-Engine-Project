The main virtue of this representation is\r\nits sensitivity to the structure of the model, which can translate into exponential\r\ntime savings for search algorithms. In this paper we introduce an AND/OR search\r\nalgorithm that explores a context-minimal AND/OR search graph in a best-first\r\nmanner for solving 0/1 Integer Linear Programs (0/1 ILP). We also extend to the\r\n0/1 ILP domain the depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search with caching\r\nalgorithm which was recently proposed by [1] for solving optimization tasks in\r\ngraphical models. The effectiveness of the best-first AND/OR search approach\r\ncompared to the depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search is demonstrated\r\non a variety of benchmarks for 0/1 ILPs, including instances from the MIPLIB\r\nlibrary, real-world combinatorial auctions, random uncapacitated warehouse location\r\nproblems and MAX-SAT instances.\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r140.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8479.0}
