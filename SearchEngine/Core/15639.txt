At each stage of an electron multiplier, each\n    electron, upon striking the plate, generates a Poisson distributed\n    number of electrons for the next stage. Suppose that the mean of the\n    Poisson distribution is 1.2 electrons, and assume that the process\n    runs for 20 generations.<br>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Simulate the electron multiplier process several times,\n        plotting each realization on the same plot. What is the general\n        trend for this process?</li>\n      <li>Simulate the process 1000 times and calculate the proportion\n        of those 1000 realizations that went extinct. What probability\n        is this proportion estimating?<br>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <h3>What to turn into EEE Dropbox</h3>\n    <p>Each student pair should turn in two files to EEE Dropbox:<br>\n    </p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>An R script file (extension .R) containing your R code (and\n        comments): <a href=\"Hancock-ExampleLabCode.R\">Hancock-ExampleLabCode.R</a><br>\n      </li>\n      <li>A Word (or pdf or equivalent) document containing R output and\n        answers to the lab assignment questions: <a\n          href=\"Hancock-ExampleLab.doc\">Hancock-ExampleLab.doc</a><br>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>The Word document should be all-encompassing -- everything that\n      we need to grade the assignment should be included.
