1994 SIAM J Computing 28 2 652 673 1998 This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting two terminals in a graph allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage dominated by a single source shortest path computation The paths it finds are the k shortest in the graph where k is a parameter given as input to the algorithm The k shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems network routing hypothesis generation in computational linguistics and sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in bioinformatics Although there have been many papers on the k shortest paths problem before and after this one it has become frequently cited in those application areas Additionally it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could be solved a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time bounds of this paper Subsequent work has focused instead on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative formulations of the

that planar graphs have bounded local treewidth we characterize the other minor closed families with this property Specifically minor closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
