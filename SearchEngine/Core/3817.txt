This data structure is a randomized, balanced\nvariant of a quadtree data structure. In particular, it defines\na hierarchical decomposition of space into cells, which\nare based on hyperrectangles of bounded aspect ratio, each\nof constant combinatorial complexity. It can be viewed as a\nmultidimensional generalization of the treap data structure\nof Seidel and Aragon. When inserted, points are assigned\nrandom priorities, and the tree is restructured through rotations\nas if the points had been inserted in priority order.\nIn any fixed dimension <i>d</i>, we show it is possible to store a\nset of <i>n</i> points in a quadtreap of space O(<i>n</i>). The height\n<i>h</i> of\nthe tree is O(log <i>n</i>) with high probability. It supports point\ninsertion in time O(<i>h</i>). It supports point deletion in worstcase\ntime O(<i>h</i><sup>2</sup>) and expected-case time O(<i>h</i>), averaged over\nthe points of the tree. It can answer &epsilon;-approximate spherical\nrange counting queries over groups and approximate nearest\nneighbor queries in time O(<i>h</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1/&epsilon;)<sup><i>d</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>).</p>\n\n<p>(Based on a paper by David Mount and Eunhui Park at SoCG 2010.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3817.0}
