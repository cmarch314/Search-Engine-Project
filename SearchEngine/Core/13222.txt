Theor Comp Sci 86 2 243 266 1991 Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges From such an

intersection of several convex polyhedra By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets represented by polyhedra this leads to algorithms for a dynamic linear program in which updates change the set of constraints The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed by Agarwal and Matou ek but this paper also includes polylog time results for semi online problems and uses them to
