Overlapping curves are boundaries of deformed disks with multiple overlaps In this project we first find the deformation pattern of the disk called the immersion which produces a self overlapping curve Next we propose a novel algorithm for morphing between two self overlapping curves such that each intermediate curve is also self overlapping Our morphing algorithm is based on an aesthetically good triangulation of the interior of a self overlapping curve This triangulation algorithm is based on our immersion algorithm 2D Nesting Problem The 2D Nesting problem is a famous problem in Computational Geometry where the objective is to fit multiple shapes into a fixed region We look to approach this problem using a new method called the convex hull hierarchy iCVideo Interactive Collaborative Video The REAQTIVE paradigm aims to make optimal use of an ensemble of limited resource low quality projection enabled multimedia devices to produce a higher quality viewing experience than is not possible with a single such device A group of users partaking in a multimedia session such as watching a video or sharing a multimedia presentation can aggregate a group of low cost quality devices that are designed and assembled to work NeuroViz A Visual Navigation System for Querying Large Stem Cell Image Data Cellular biology deals with studying the behavior of cells Current time lapse imaging microscopes help us capture the progress of experiments at intervals that allow for understanding of the dynamic and kinematic behavior of the cells On the other hand these devices generate such massive amounts of data 25 GB of data per experiment that manual sieving of data to identify interesting patterns becomes virtually impossible Content Adaptive User Controllable Capture and Display Very soon users would seek greater control over the resources available in a display or a camera Such resources include color resolution spatial resolution spectral resolution and so on For example they would want to target resolution at the most important object in the scene during capture or display Or they would want to change the spectral sensitivity of the primaries based on the scene illumination condition e g CMY for dark scenes RGB for bright scenes and 6 primary for colorful scenes Ubiquitous Displays Imagine a world in which people can use their handheld mobile devices to project and transfer content Everyone can join the collaboration by simply bringing their mobile devices close to each other People can grab data from each others devices with simple hand gestures Now imagine a large display created by tiling multiple displays where multiple users can interact with a large dynamically changing data set in a collocated collaborative setting and the displays will take care of the data transfer and handling functions in a way that is transparent to the users Data Management Access and Compression for Interactive 3D Rendering Current graphics and visualization systems have to be built such that they can handle gigantic data sets like those from large scientific simulations including nuclear and power simulations and geometric data sets such as digital models of defense and commercial equipments like aircrafts ships and power plants Such large data sets cannot fit into the main memory of the machines or rendered interactively in current graphics systems Tiled Projection Based Display Walls Multiple projectors can be tiled to build displays of mammoth scale and high resolution in a cost effective manner However since the image comes from multiple displays they need to registered in color and geometry to make the display look like one large seamless display We design automatic camera based methods that can achieve accurate registration across a large number of projectors in a scalable manner Appearance Editing In this system we superimposes multiple projections onto an object of arbitrary shape and color to produce high resolution appearance changes Our system produces appearances at a resolution higher than what is possible with a single projector and can change appearances at near interactive rates We achieved several appearance edits including specular lighting subsurface scattering inter reflections and color texture and geometry changes on objects with different shapes and colors Perception Based Image Processing Study of contrast sensitivity of the human eye shows that our suprathreshold contrast sensitivity follows the Weber Law and hence increases proportionally with the increase in the mean local luminance In this project we effectively apply this fact to design a contrast enhancement method for images that improves the local image contrast by controlling the local image gradient with a single parameter Triangle Stripification Triangle strips have been widely used for efficient rendering It is NP complete to test whether a given triangulated model can be represented as a single triangle strip so many heuristics have been proposed to partition models into few long strips In this paper we present a new algorithm for creating a single triangle loop or strip from a triangulated model Non Photo Realistic Rendering We present simple rendering techniques implemented using traditional graphics hardware to achieve the effects of charcoal drawing The effects include characteristics of charcoal drawings like broad grainy strokes and smooth tonal variations that are achieved by smudging the charcoal by hand Further we also generate the closure effect that is used by artists at times to avoid hard silhouette edges All these effects are achieved using contrast enhancement operators on textures and or colors of the 3D model Donald Bren School of Information and
