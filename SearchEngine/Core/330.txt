People capture \n     photos in a variety of different events like parties, trips, weddings or even conferences. \n     We have been building the CueNet framework, a context discovery framework to use EXIF \n     metadata of personal photos, and information about the owner of the photos, to discover \n     who might be participating in this event, and therefore can be present in the photo. In \n     this demonstration, we present Picatrix: an event based photo browsing web interface. \n     Users can select a photo, and see a live visualization of how our context discovery \n     algorithm, seeded with the initial information, discovers context from different data \n     sources, and uses it to tag the faces in the given photo.\n     </p>\n     \n     <h3> Visualize Discovery of Candidates for Sample Photos: </h3>\n     <table align=center cellpadding=\"10\">\n     <tr align=center>\n       <td>\n         <a href='simple/' target=\"_blank\">\n         <img src='simple/images/data/icmr-keynote-2-show.jpg' width=370px>\n         </a>\n       </td>\n       <td>\n         <a href='complex/' target=\"_blank\">\n         <img src='complex/images/data/vldb-show-all.jpg'>\n         </a>\n       </td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr align=center>\n       <td>\n         Click <a href='simple/' target=\"_blank\">here</a>\n         to see a simple scenario (1 data source).\n       </td>\n       <td>\n         Click <a href='complex/' target=\"_blank\">here</a> \n         to see a complex scenario, requiring more <br> than one data source (2-5 sources).\n       </td>\n     </tr>\n     </table>\n     \n     <p>\n     <h3>Video explaining the visulizations</h3>\n     Please click on the youtube video below to see the demo of our system (please play the video \n     at 720p resolution for best performance).
