{"text": "Signs of a good presentation speaking clearly and projecting your voice eye contact with the audience having something interesting to talk about talk about engaging your audience pull you in and get you interested in articulate and be clear good speakers put pauses in appropriate places make sure you ve thought about it and it s organized and it doesn t jump all over the place thinking on the fly is important even when people ask a question use of visual presentations especially tom s movie about the lawnmower Look at the audience instead of looking at your notes it s good to have notes too in case you forget connect with the audience by opening with an interesting statement or joke throw in a compliment to the teacher keep it succinct and thought about what I said before getting in front of the class described the background of the system briefly described what the system does described the changes he wanted to make skip redundant and already known information and get to specific information the visual presentation managed to emphasize eye contact and showing a video takes the focus from the speaker make eye contact with audience have interesting material and be interested in your own material so the audience will be more interested be sure of yourself and don t second guess yourself or apologize be prepared beforehand and have notes so questions won t catch you off guard prepare for the presentation in front of friends with a watch make sure you know your time limits and what your audience knows and doesn t know made decent eye contact eye contact shows confidence and that you re not reading from a script have an interesting opening if you don t grab your audience at the beginning you get lost refer back to points others have made keep the audience in mind so they are appropriate in terms of content and background listen to other presentations carefully make good eye contact spoke clearly and loud enough have an idea of what he was going to say follow the time limit emphasize the program name title of talk if you miss this your audience will get lost thereafter good job with the audience and described the system good job with eye contact structure the talk and let the audience know what points you re going to get to get the material at the right level for the audience too simple and you ll insult bore your audience and too complex and you ll lose your audience smiling will reduce the intimidation of eye contact only use hand gestures if they re related to the topic of the presentation most people got it within the alloted time spoke loud enough for everyone to hear everyone got their point across even if they were nervous talked about the stuff we needed to talk about I e system name and changes planned it helped when the presenters were interested in their topic if they aren t bored I m not bored it helped when people spoke slowly and clearly and were brief with their introduction and got to the point with their planned changes it helped that they really knew what was wrong with the system and went on to discuss the proposed changes organized with topics I could understand it very well when the voice was loud and clear some of them were clear and loud some used humor some knew exactly how to present their system and went on to cover the changes in a minute some people were well prepared and knew what their system was about and what changes they wanted to make if the audience had used the system before they already understood what they were talking about people tried to write their names neatly on the board so I could recognize who the speaker was it was good when people involved the audience and used props to get the audience to feel more involved and get them to care most people were very clear and spoke loudly enough for me to hear in the back most of them were interesting programs that need to be changed some people were very prepared the session was very interesting in that I learned about what people do at the end of every session the audience clapped which makes people feel better practice the speech a lot Things to watch out for when giving presentations talking too quickly fidget rambling don t bore the audience talking too quickly was a little nervous trying to get through the material on time presentation is too short and not well prepared didn t cover all the points since others had covered them earlier didn t use hand gestures and they help when presenting don t say um a lot it shows you don t know what you re talking about you don t want to be overly animated but you ve got to show you care about it to make your audience care about it supplement your oral presentation with visual aids especially if you ve got an accent could not elaborate the background and comparison between his system and others could not complete all of the change proposals and he had an accent spoke too quickly didn t make eye contact wasn t aware the presentation was yesterday go off topic and add unnecessary info and jargon use too many clich s and colloquialisms avoid saying um don t talk too fast and start rambling sped through the topic too quickly and felt pressure due to the time limit didn t make any notes or prepare well enough for the topic make sure you know the time limit on the presentation so you don t end up with too much content for the amount of time spoke too much about a topic he knew too well and the audience did as well didn t get to demonstrate what he had in mind avoid saying um don t be nervous didn t look at the audience as much paced somewhat didn t have an interesting opening statement spoke in monotone spoke too deeply about one topic and forgot what he was going to say next the company was making some of the changes he was going to propose already so he had to modify his talk hard to tell time especially with the clock out of periphery people rushed through it and got nervous didn t make eye contact or zoned out didn t elaborate enough and you were clueless about what they were talking about writing the names of each speaker was too slow and made people rush especially towards the end so we missed the content of each speech it was repetitive that there were projects that were closely related I don t have eye contact with the audience didn t control the time well I was too nervous because of the time limit there wasn t much of a response from the audience some of the presentations were interrupted by alex with the time warnings some of the systems proposed I didn t understand they lost me some went way over some went off topic as the time ran out in class people started talking before they got to the front of the room some folks gave just a few features and went into great detail while others listed each of the features on a very high level some people were rushing through the presentation some people didn t go into detail about their system and thus the audience couldn t understand what they were talking about it was bad when people wrote their names near another s as it created confusion some people were well prepared and others were making it up off the cuff people gave too much detail rather than getting to the point alex s interruptions with the time warning killed the flow of some of the presentations it was a one minute presentation so there wasn t much time to talk about your individual project you can t tell a lot about the product in one minute basically just the stuff you emailed to alex", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cjensen/teaching/139/PresentationHints.html",
