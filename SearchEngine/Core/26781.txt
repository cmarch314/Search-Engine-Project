This session discusses the\n need for active meta data management and a distributed repository\n architecture that spans DCOM/CORBA to address the needs of enterprise\n wide meta data management.  Meta objects and meta models (OMG UML and\n MOF) are at the core of new standards being adopted by OMG.  Industry\n product development efforts at IBM, Unisys and Microsoft are finally\n coming to fruition and being deployed by customers.  This session will\n cover:\n \n<p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Repository concepts and need for dynamic and extensible meta data\n management\n<li>Evolution of repository architectures from monolithic to extensible\n distributed object repositories\n<li>An architecture for a CORBA/DCOM based repository for the\n enterprise\n<li>OMG efforts in repositories, components  and information models\n (UML, MOF, BOF, CORBA Component Model...) \n<li>Representative object repository products (IBM, Microsoft,\n Unisys...)\n<li>Examples of object repository use in development tools integration,\n data warehousing and business objects\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\nTune in for the latest scoop from recent OMG meetings on the status of\n these evolving standards and industry products.\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography:</strong> <p>\n\nSridhar Iyengar, a Unisys Fellow leads the \ntechnology strategy for object technology products in Unisys.  Sridhar's \ncurrent focus includes the integration of object frameworks, components, \ndatabase, repository, internet and distributed object technology products for \nUnisys.  He is the chief architect of  Unisys Universal Repository (UREP)  \nan extensible distributed object repository.  Sridhar represents Unisys at \nthe OMG where he co-chairs the Object Analysis & Design Task Force (OA&DTF) \nwhich standardized the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Meta Object \nFacility(MOF) standards. He has a masters degree in computer science and is a \nfrequent presenter in industry conferences on topics of repositories, \ndatabases, component software and distributed object technology.\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html\">Directions</a> to meeting are available.\n\n<p>\n\nNext Meeting: <p>\n\nDate: Friday, March 27, 1998<br>\nTopic: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/flyers/98/mar98.html\">\nSoftware Systems Metrics</a><br>\nSpeakers: Rita Costello Creel and Sharon K.
