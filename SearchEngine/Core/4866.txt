In this talk, I will summarize\nresearch pursued under the BU CloudCommons project \n(<a href=\"http://csr.bu.edu/cc\">http://csr.bu.edu/cc</a>)\naimed at addressing these issues, focusing on novel approaches seeking to\nbuild trust in the economic utility of IaaS marketplaces. I will start by\npresenting a periodic model for expressive specification of elastic cloud\nsupply and demand that allows provably-safe transformation of SLAs from one\nform to another. Next, I will show that such expressive SLAs facilitate the\nemergence of an efficient, trustworthy marketplace, by presenting three\ngame-theoretic mechanisms for cloud resource management. The first mechanism\nenables rational tenants to collocate their workloads to minimize the\nindividual costs they incur to secure the shared cloud resources necessary to\nsupport their application SLAs. The second mechanism enables rational parties\nto coordinate their use of a shared resource so as to maximize their\nindividual utilities by creating a marketplace for trading usage rights. The\nthird mechanism uses dynamic pricing to ensure efficient utilization of\nproviders' resources, while guaranteeing rational fairness to all customers.\nTime permitting, I will conclude with an overview the Massachusetts Open Cloud\n(<a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/moc\">http://www.bu.edu/moc</a>)\n\u2013 the first prototypical implementation of an Open\nCloud eXchange (OCX) that makes the adoption of these (and other) trustworthy\nmarketplace mechanisms possible in an operational setting.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4866.0}
