The typical uses are reading molecules from\nPDB or XYZ format files without explicit hydrogens.  This functionality is\ninvoked by <code>OEAssignImplicitHydrogens</code>, which must always be followed by\na call to <code>OEAssignFormalCharges</code>.  This valence model is unique in that\nit only partially updates hydrogen counts, assuming the unfilled valences\nwill be corrected by OpenEye's charge valence model above.  In MDL's model\nfor example, a neutral sodium atom is assumed to have one implicit hydrogen,\n<I>i.e.</I> sodium hydride instead of sodium metal.  In OpenEye's hydrogen\ncount valence model, a disconnected sodium atom is assumed to be a sodium\ncation, <code>[Na+]</code>.  When reading from PDB files, this is a very reasonable\nassumption.\n\n<P>\nNote that although the OpenEye hydrogen count valence model often sets charge\nand protonation states to physiological conditions, it is neither intended to\nbe a pKa nor ionization state predictor.  Instead, it is a normalization.  Much\nlike many registry system (and the MDL valence model) will convert\n<code>C(=O)[O-]</code> to <code>C(=O)O</code> for registration purposes, this valence\nmodel converts the opposite direction to <code>C(=O)[O-]</code>.\n\n<P>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>Carbon is always assumed to be at least four valent, and therefore\nneutral.\n\n<P>\n</LI>\n<LI>Nitrogens that are conjugated (have double bonds, or have neighbors that\nhave double bonds, in their Kekul&#233; representations) are assumed at least\nthree valent and neutral, whilst all other nitrogens are assumed to be\n(minimum) four valent, with a +1 formal charge.\n\n<P>\n</LI>\n<LI>Oxygens are assumed to be at least two valent and neutral, unless they\nhave a single bond to an atom that is doubly bonded to oxygen, in which case\nits assumed to be one valent, with a -1 formal charge.\n\n<P>\n</LI>\n<LI>Sulfur is assumed to always be at least two valent.\n\n<P>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n\n<P>\nAll other elements are assumed to have no implicit hydrogens, and the formal\ncharge as specified by the OpenEye charge model.  This models all disconnected\nhalogens as halide anions, and when disconnected the metals listed above as\ncations.\n\n<P>\nThese rules are sufficient to reasonably protonate proteins read from PDB\nfiles.  However, as described above, these rules are not intended to be a\ncomprehensive rule-based pKa predictor.  Users interested in predicting\nphysiological ionization, and protonation/disassociation state enumeration\nshould contact OpenEye Scientific Software about our tools for exactly this\ntask.\n\n<P>\n\n<DIV CLASS=\"navigation\">\n<p><hr>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node240.html\"><img src=\"../icons/previous.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Previous Page\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node239.html\"><img src=\"../icons/up.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Up One Level\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node242.html\"><img src=\"../icons/next.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Next Page\"></A></td><td width=\"100%\" rowspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"center\" align=\"right\" height=\"56\" background=\"../icons/title_bkgd.gif\" colspan=4 class=\"navigation\">OEChem - C++ Theory Manual\n<BR>\nVersion 1.3.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_1.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"contents.html\"><img src=\"../icons/contents.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Contents\"></A></td>\n<td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_2.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"../icons/blank_4.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n</tr></table>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Previous:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node240.html\">28.2.1 The OpenEye Charge</A>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Up:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node239.html\">28.2 The OpenEye Valence</A>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Next:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node242.html\">29.
