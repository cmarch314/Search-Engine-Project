The heuristics are extracted from a parameterized \r\napproximation scheme called Mini-Bucket elimination that allows controlled trade-off\r\nbetween computation and accuracy. The heuristics are used to guide Branch-and-\r\nBound and Best-First search. Their performance is compared on two optimization\r\ntasks: the Max-CSP task defined on deterministic databases and the Most Probable \r\nExplanation task defined on probabilistic databases. Benchmarks were random\r\ndata sets as well as applications to coding and medical diagnosis problems. Our \r\nresults demonstrate that the heuristics generated are effective for both search schemes,\r\npermitting controlled trade-off between preprocessing (for heuristic generation) and\r\nsearch.\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r94.ps\"><b>PostScript</b></a> |\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r94.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8372.0}
