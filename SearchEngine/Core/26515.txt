12 noon Student Center Monarch Bay A B University of California Irvine There is a 15 charge for non sponsors Checks should be made payable to UC Regents This Charge is waived for students and the unemployed No reservations required Featured Speaker Watts S Humphrey SEI Fellow Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University watts sei cmu edu The Team Software Process TSP SM has been designed to help engineering teams more effectively develop software intensive products TSPSM has been used with pure software teams and with mixed teams of hardware and software engineers TSPSM has also been used for both new development and enhancement and with commercial and imbedded real time systems The languages used have included Java C Jovial C and special 4GLs TSPSM can be used with teams of from 2 to 2 engineers developing or enhancing software intensive systems Its objective is to assist the engineers in producing quality products on their planned schedules and within their estimated costs This talk describes TSP sSM objectives the logic behind the TSPSM process and the relationships among the TSPSM PSPSM and CMM A growing number of organizations have used the TSPSM and this talk will describe the experiences of several of them and provide some data on their results Finally the talk briefly reviews the TSPSM introduction strategy and some of the key issues involved in successfully introducing the TSPSM Biography Mr Humphrey is currently an SEI Fellow at the Software Engineering Institute SEI of Carnegie Mellon University He joined the SEI after his retirement from IBM in 1986 While at the SEI he established the Process Program led the initial development of the Capability Maturity ModelSM CMM framework for software for institutional growth and introduced the concepts of Software Process Assessment and Software Capability Evaluation The CMM is now used by software organizations throughout the world to guide their process improvement work It has become the standard used by the U S Department of Defense the British Ministry of Defense and many other government departments and industrial corporations to evaluate their own capabilities and those of their software suppliers His most recent work is on the Personal Software ProcessSM PSPSM and the Team Software Process SM TSPSM Prior to joining the SEI Mr Humphrey spent 27 years with IBM in various technical executive positions including the management of all IBM commercial software development This included the first 19 releases of OS 36 He was also IBMs Vice President of Technical Development responsible for the system architecture and software development for the IBM System 37 product line At one time while he was IBM director of Policy Development he was responsible for IBMs world wide hardware and software contracts and competitive practices Most recently he was IBM s Director of Programming Quality and Process Mr Humphrey holds graduate degrees in Physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology and Business Administration from the University of Chicago He is an SEI Fellow a member of the ACM an IEEE Fellow and a past member of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Board of Examiners He was awarded the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Software Engineering Award for 1993 and the SEI Leadership Award in 1997 His publications include many technical papers and six books His most recent books are Managing the Software Process 1989 A Discipline for Software Engineering 1995 Managing Technical People 1996 and Introduction to the Personal Software Process 1997 He holds five US Patents SM Capability Maturity Model Personal Software Process PSP Team Software Process and TSP are service marks of Carnegie Mellon University Registered in
