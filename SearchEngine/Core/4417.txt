ecosystem Sept 2 12 present The development of a software system is now ever more frequently a part of a larger development effort including multiple software systems that co exist in the same environment a software ecosystem Though most studies of the evolution of software have focused on a single software system there is much that we can learn from the analysis of a set of interrelated systems Topic modeling techniques show promise for mining the data stored in software repositories to understand the evolution of a system In my research I seek to explore how topic modeling

understand the evolution of software and will inform the design of tools that support software engineering activities such as feature location expertise identification and bug detection Google Software Research Intern June 2 12 Sept 2 12Worked as developer in the Google Analytics Management API project In charge of designing and implementing the write API for GA management entities Survey of Concern oriented development Sept 2 11 June 2 12 Concern oriented development has been of significant interest to the software engineering community since the early formulation of its importance by Dijkstra and Parnas Many different approaches have emerged since then and continue to emerge which support developers when they need to reason about and make changes to code in terms of the concerns that govern the system While initially much work focused on modularization of concerns relying on programmatic constructs to encapsulate concerns in modules new types of approaches have more recently emerged that address the problem from quite different directions and lead to quite different forms of support I have been working on a survey that is inclusive of the breadth of approaches to date Its main contributions are a set of definitions of concerns that precisely delineate the field an evaluation framework that characterizes a set of capabilities that any approach to concern oriented development ideally should offer an articulation of how four previously disparate categories of approaches closely relate and a set of nine observations that take stock of the field as it stands today and provide guidance as to where it should head in the future Google Software Research Intern June 2 11 Sept 2 11Worked with the TvAds group at the Google Irvine office Designed and built support infrastructure for a web based application Improved client side web caching mechanisms to deliver better performance Contextualized Coding Sept 2 1 June 2 11 The Contextualized coding project aims to improve development by providing richer contextual cues to developers mined from process support tools and code analysis The Code Orb is the first prototype view which shows developers fine grained information related to code volatility The Code Orb is implemented as a series of plug ins to the Eclipse IDE IBM research intern June 2 1 Sept 2 1 Worked in a development co op with the Ottawa software group in the Jazz Rational Team Concert RTC Versioning system group My development effort had as objective improving the integration of the versioning features of Jazz RTC with other versioning systems such as GIT and Subversion Concretely I implemented extensions to export and synchronize files maintained in Jazz RTC with Subversion Scalability and performance was a critical issue of this integration Frameworks Languages used Eclipse plug ins Java SVNKit Calico 2 9 2 1 Calico is a free hand rapid design tool for the initial creative and typically informal stages of software design Calico is designed to support the informal phases of design with features that are designed to amplify good creative design practices I worked as developer extending the functionalities of the tool and afterward I performed usability evaluations of some of the newer functionalities of the tool and drafting research results from these experiences Calico is a Java stand alone application Change Based PLAs and CM 2 8 2 9I was lead developer for a research project were we integrated change based SCM tool implemented in JEE technology and a Product Line Architecture definition environment The integration maps the product architecture defined in xADL EASEL and ArchStudio to a concrete implementation in Java and maintains the consistency of the implementation with its architectural definition in a change based SCM Frameworks Languages used Java code generation with Velocity Eclipse plug ins Management Game 2 7 2 9In June 2 7 we initiated a project to develop a support environment for the Management Game course taken by undergraduate students in the last semester of the Business Program at University of Los Andes My role in the project was as lead Software Architect in charge of defining and specifying the system global design technological platform and architectural restrictions Additionally I assisted the project leader in the implementation and testing phases of the project Frameworks Languages used JEE code generation with MDA EMF ATLs DSLs XML XSL Java Java Server Faces Hibernate Testing in a Global Environment 2 4 2 6This research project that had as main objective the definition of an appropriate testing and software defect correction process in a global software development environment and the development of process support tools and an integration platform that fulfills the requirements of an appropriate infrastructure for Internet scale integration My role was as designer and lead developer of an event based messaging infrastructure Frameworks Languages used J2EE Java code generation using XMI and XSL QualDev development Group 2 5 2 9I was the leader of a development group made up mainly of undergraduate students in a capstone project course This group is a software engineering laboratory where students learn how to use software processes methodologies and applications as tools to produce high quality software The group works as a laboratory to experiment with software processes and technologies The group develops tools in the broad domain of software development process support and some of these are successfully used in real contexts Frameworks Languages used J2EE JEE Java PHP JME XML Jena Velocity Hibernate Spoon JSF Struts amongst many others Nicolas Lopez Giraldo University of California

Its main contributions are a set of definitions of concerns that precisely delineate the field, an evaluation framework that characterizes a set of capabilities that any approach to concern-oriented development ideally should offer, an articulation of how four, previously disparate categories of approaches closely relate, and a set of nine observations that take stock of the field as it stands today and provide guidance as to where it should head in the future.\r\n\t\t\t\t</td></tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr><td align=\"right\"><b>Google Software Research Intern: June 2011 - Sept 2011</b></td><td>Worked with the TvAds group at the Google Irvine office.
