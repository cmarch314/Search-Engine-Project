Young and  Richard N. Taylor in\n<i>Proceedings of the Ninth International Software Process Workshop,</i>\nArlie, VA, October 1994. IEEE Computer Society Press.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThe Teamware process programming system is designed to support the\ncoordination and control of software engineering teams.  In a\ntraditional computer language the program is executed by the computer.\nIn contrast, in Teamware the process program is primarily exeucted by\nhumans.  The Teamware interpreter supports execution by keeping team\nmembers informed of their work assignments, by providing access to\ninformation on the context of individual work assignments, and by\ncoordinating transfer of artifacts and tools.  Providing a language\nfor specifying processes executed by humans rather than computers has\nprofound implications on language design.  This paper identifies key\nrequirements on languages and systems designed to specify and support\nhuman-executed processes.  It then discusses how Teamware addresses\nthese requirements.  The paper concludes with a brief discussion of\nvalidation exerciese performed on Teamware and with a short comparison\nto related research.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Jan 31 10:52:28 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 25907.0}
