Previously superpatterns had\nbeen considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this\nto sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that\nthe 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the\nknown bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation\nsubclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.\nWe apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets\nof points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex\nplanar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct\nuniversal sets of size approximately <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4,\nand we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded\npathwidth.\n<p>\n<li><b>Small superpatterns for dominance drawing</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbannist/\">M.
