This \nmodel is inspired by and particularly applicable to natural datasets such \nas images. We begin by providing the mathematical framework, where \nwe discuss complete and overcomplete models, and provide algorithms \nfor training these models from data. Using patches of natural scenes we \ndemonstrate that our approach represents a viable alternative to independent components analysis as an interpretive model of biological visual \nsystems. Although the two approaches are similar in flavor there are also \nimportant differences, particularly when the representations are overcomplete. By constraining the interactions within our model we are also able \nto study the topographic organization of Gabor-like receptive fields that \nare learned by our model. Finally, we discuss the relation of our new approach to previous work  in particular Gaussian Scale Mixture models, \nand variants of independent components analysis. \n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/OsinderoWH_NC_2005/OsinderoWH_NC_2005.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nSimon Osindero, Max Welling, and Geoffrey&nbsp;E.
