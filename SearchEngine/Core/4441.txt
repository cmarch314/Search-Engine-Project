Assuming 2 minutes for questions and 2 minutes for laptop switching, this brings us to 9-10 minutes per project.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n    The class project is meant to be a opportunity to explore a specific machine learning concept in depth, or an application-driven project focused on a particular real-world dataset. A typical project might be applying a technique from a research paper on one of the datasets linked to below.\n    The choice of projects can be very open-ended; ideally you can incorporate their own research. But your class project must be about new things you\nhave done this semester; you can't use results you have developed in previous semesters.  People can work individually or in teams of two.<br>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>Project grading</h2> Recall the project is worth half the class grade.<br>\n\nA project proposal is due on March 3rd. This is worth 10% of the project grade. The proposal should include a title, a pointer to the dataset, roughly 2 paragraphs describing the project idea, and a list of 1-3 relevant papers.\n\nYou must prepare a writeup in the format of a <a href=\"http://leon.bottou.com/nips/\">NIPS paper</a> (8 pages maximum in <a href=\"http://leon.bottou.com/nips/\">NIPS format</a>, including references; this page limit is strict), due <b>March 21rst at 1pm</b> in the \"Final Projects\" folder in the dropbox. The writeup is worth 60% of the project grade. A single writeup is required per project.\n\nYou will also be responsible for a 5 minute project presentation, also on March 21rst. This will count toward 30% of the project grade.\n\n<hr>\n<h2> Project ideas </h2>\nAgain, you are strongly encouraged to find a project aligned with their own research interests. But if you are looking for inspiration, there are numerous similar courses out there, with a plethora of interesting projects!<br>\n\n    <a href = \"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guestrin/Class/10701-F07/projects.html#image\"> CMU </a><br>\n\n    <a href = \"http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/projects2006.html\"> Stanford</a><br>\n    \n<a href = \"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs478/2002sp/project/options.html \"> Cornell</a><br>\n\n<a href = \"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~roweis/csc2515-2006/assign/project-ideas.txt\"> Toronto</a><br>\n\n<a href = \"http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.867-f04/projects.html\"> MIT</a><br>\n\n<hr>\n<h2> Research paper references </h2>\nGood places to look for papers:<br>\nThese include the major machine learning conferences such as <a href = \"http://www.nips.cc/\">NIPS</a> and ICML.
