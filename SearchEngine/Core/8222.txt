Contemporary\ncomputer vision research draws heavily from machine learning and serves as a\ntesting ground for new ML theories and algorithms. Computer vision in turn\nprovides a set of tools for many applications in multimedia information systems\nand HCI, as well as the natural sciences, e.g. biomedical imaging. Graduate\nstudents completing this course will be well prepared to comprehend current\nresearch in computer vision or apply state-of-the-art techniques to problems of\ninterest in their own field.\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\"> Prerequisites </span>\n<p> The following undergraduate courses or their equivalent: ICS 6D/Mathematics 6D, Mathematics 6G or 3A, Mathematics 2A-B, ICS 23.\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\"> Required course materials </span>\n<ul>\n<p></p><li> <em>Computer Vision, A Modern Approach</em> by Forsyth and Ponce.\n</ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\"> Recommended course materials </span>\n<ul>\n<p><li > <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/szeliski/Book/\">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a> by Szeliski.

In particular, no sharing of code. Please see the university policy on academic honesty. It is fine to use reference materials found online, but do not search for homework solutions. Rather, students are strongly encouraged to ask questions at both office hours and on the class discussion group. \n\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\">Acknowledgemnts</span> \n<p>I gladly acknowledge a host of other instructors for making their teaching materials available online.
