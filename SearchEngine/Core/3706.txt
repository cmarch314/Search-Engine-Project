This mode of operation\ncontrasts with \"on-line\" computation, in which inputs arrive\nincrementally as computation proceeds, and outputs are produced\nincrementally as well.  We will examine the problem of performing\narithmetic operations on-line. To do this we must first consider\nvarious input-output conventions and discuss alternative\ncomputational models.  The seemingly mundane problem of \"rounding\"\nbrings key issues into focus,\ngiving rise to new open questions as well as new results. \n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3706.0}
