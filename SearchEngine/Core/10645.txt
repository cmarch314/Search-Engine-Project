known as bounded local treewidth a functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth Previously known results imply that planar graphs have bounded local treewidth we characterize the other minor closed families with this property Specifically minor closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there exists an apex graph G that is not in F an apex

approximations to several NP hard optimization problems can be computed efficiently on these graphs extending previous results for planar graphs Some of these results were announced in the conference version of subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related problems but not included in the journal version Since its publication there have been many more works on local treewidth The class of

Specifically,\nminor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there\nexists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph\nthat can be made planar by removing a single vertex.\nThe minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have\nbounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus\ngraphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the\ntreewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As\na consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and\napproximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed\nefficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar\ngraphs.\n<p>Some of these results\nwere announced in the conference version of\n\"<a href=\"p-psgi.html\">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related\nproblems</a>\" but not included in the journal version. Since its\npublication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of\nproblems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local\ntreewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, \"<a\nhref=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504794.504798\">Deciding first-order\nproperties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>\", <i>J.

As a consequence, we can\ndetermine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be\nflattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of\nthe graph can be folded independently of the other faces.\n<p>\n<li><b><i>k</i>-best enumeration</b>.<br>\nD.
