If you know you are going to miss something important contact the instructor beforehand It s much easier to accommodate planned absences Students are responsible for all material taught in this course If you join the class later in the quarter you are expected to complete all missed work immediately Sick Policy If you find that you are unable to make it to a scheduled event class exam presentation etc due to sickness please get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class In the absence of such documentation please contact the staff as soon as you realize that you are going to miss a scheduled event Generally sicknesses will be treated on a case by case basis We will accommodate you as best as we can depending on the circumstances Respect This class will involve discussion of topics on which you and your classmates may have differences in opinion Please be respectful of others at all times Academic Honesty Please familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy The consequences of academic dishonesty are not worth the risks Students with Disabilities or Special Needs Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability religious observance or anything else should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs If appropriate contact the Disability Services Center at 949 824 7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion Technology in Class Please turn off all mobile phones pagers etc before the beginning of each class Please do not use notebook computers or any other technology during class for any purpose not directly relating to this class Web Page Readings and Assignments The web page for the class is subject to update Check it frequently and be sure to refresh reload the web pages when you browse them Please follow the assignments exactly If you need clarification ask before the assignment is due Correspondence We will send course announcements by email to the official course mailing list so you should check your email regularly Note that this mailing list goes to the email address that the registrar has for you your UCInetID If you prefer to read your Email on another account you should set your UCInetID account to forward your Email to

the subject line If you do not get a response to the email in 24 hours except weekends and your issue remains unresolved please resend your email or talk to me after class I recommend also CCing the EEE class mailing list on non personal issues so that the entire class benefits from the discussion Late Assignments Assignments that are one day late will have their grades reduced by one letter grade A to B etc Projects more than one day late will not be accepted Course Mechanics and Grading Grading Reading Summaries at Beginning of 2 3 Class Meetings 1 Leading Discussion 2 Attendance Participation in Other Discussions 2 Final Project 4 Summary References 5 Project Update 5 Video 1 Paper 2 Peer Reviewing 1 Readings Each week there will be several articles videos or other pieces of content assigned You should read view the items before coming to class on the day that they are listed You may need to be on campus or logged in via VPN to access some of these materials without paying for them http www nacs uci edu security vpn The required book for this class is Ubiquitous Computing Fundamentals UCF Reading Summaries Occasionally at the beginning of class you will be asked to write a one paragraph summary of one or more recent readings videos These reading summaries will not be announced There are no makeups for missed summaries without a doctor s note or other clear evidence of an excusable absence Leading Discussion You will be asked to work with one or two classmates to lead discussion or one or more readings at least once during this course Here are some tips on how to lead a discussion Your grade will be based on the following criteria 1 Articulates author s argument correctly and completely 2 Identifies nuances of author s argument 4 Poses thoughtful open ended questions or creative exercises to the class 5 Guides discussion to important points 6 Maintains control of the classroom Class Participation A large part of this course is based on discussion of the topics Your grade will be based in part on your attendance attention and participation in class discussions Final Project Working in teams of 1 4 students you will engage in a ubicomp project This project may focus on any topic of mutual interest to the members of the group It could involve implementing a novel ubicomp system evaluating an existing ubicomp system or some other project relevant to the course If you are uncertain of what kind of project to pursue I encourage you to think about resource tracking and other sustainability related topics as a possible domain for your project There will be two interim deliverables and two final deliverables The interim deliverables are a 1 page summary of your project idea accompanied by a list of 2 relevant references of which approximately half should be from the Ubicomp conference due before class on Week 4 One document submitted per team a 5 6 minute presentation about your progress to date due in class on either Week 6 or 7 Team makes presentation together Presentation date week 6 or 7 will be specified when teams are assigned Your final deliverables are a 1 3 minute video describing your project One video per team an academic paper appropriate for submission to the Ubicomp conference One paper per team If you are a team of 1 2 students you are expected to deliver a Ubicomp note up to 4 pages up to 1 page of references If you are a team of 3 4 students you are expected to deliver a Ubicomp full paper up to 1 pages up to 2 pages of references You are expected to cite an appropriate selection of the academic literature in your paper More detail may be found on the Ubicomp 2 14 web site Peer Reviewing The class will be performing a peer review process as part of the final project evaluation Each student will be asked to review the papers written by three other teams In addition students will be asked to review their own paper using the same criteria In writing your reviews please be rigorous and kind the goal is to help person make better work and want to work more Note These are guidelines intended to help students plan their work in this course However the instructor reserves the right to make changes to this syllabus over the course of the quarter Assignments and Readings must be completed BEFORE the class next to which they are listed Week Date Topic Assignments Readings 1 3 31 Introduction slides None work on final project 2 4 7 Foundations and History In this class meeting we will be doing several activities to help students team up for the final project If you have an idea for a project that you might like to pursue please email me a one paragraph summary of the project by Sunday at 8pm and come to class prepared to give a 1 2 minute description of it and talk with your classmates about it Please give some thought to how many people the project might take how flexible you are about the topic e g are you amenable to being teamed up with someone with a similar idea even if it means you both need to compromise a bit or would you rather work on your own what resources you might need etc In addition shortly after class you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your team preferences UCF Chapter 1M Weiser The computer for the twenty first century Scientific American 265 3 94 1 4 September 1991 G Bell and P Dourish Yesterday s tomorrows

If you have an idea for a project that you might like to pursue, please email me a one paragraph summary of the project by Sunday at 8pm, and come to class prepared to give a 1-2 minute description of it and talk with your classmates about it.<br /> Please give some thought to how many people the project might take, how flexible you are about the topic (e.g., are you amenable to being teamed up with someone with a similar idea, even if it means you both need to compromise a bit, or would you rather work on your own), what resources you might need, etc.  In addition, shortly after class, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your team preferences.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n                            <!-- reading -->\n                            <!-- Project -->\n                            <td style=\"height: 25px; width: 448px; font-size: 10pt;\">\n                        \t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>UCF, Chapter 1</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>M.&nbsp;Weiser. <a href=\"papers/Weiser-Computer21Century-SciAm.pdf\">The computer for the twenty-first century</a>.
