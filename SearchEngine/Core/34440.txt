I see some value in just continuing this\n&gt; &gt;tradition for versions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In fact, how about making a \"version\" just a special kind of\n&gt; &gt;query?\n&gt;\n&gt; Dan Connolly agreed, stating:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Fair enough. ?version=xxx seems reasonable for (a)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, there appears to be some agreement that employing the URL parameter\n&gt; or URL query field would be useful for specifying the version of an entity.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, it is not entirely clear to me what the tradeoffs are between\n&gt; using the URL parameter mechanism (e.g., \";version={version identifier}\")\n&gt; versus using the URL query mechanism (e.g., \"?version={version\n&gt; identifier}\").  Can any members of the list shed some light on the intent\n&gt; of these two mechanisms?  This information is unavailable in either the\n&gt; HTTP specification or RFC 1738 (Uniform Resource Locators).\n\n\nI also agree that the \"?version={version identifier}\" mechanism is a good\nchoice,\nfor practical reasons - regardless of the original intent of the spec ;-).\n(I also looked for a hard distinction between \"parameter\" and \"query\" in\nthe RFCs and found nothing\nconclusive - Dan, any thoughts on this?).\n\nWhile both \"?version={version identifier}\" and \";version={version\nidentifier}\" appear to be valid\nconstructs, forms submission capability might be a consideration here.\n\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" forms submission causes current forms\nsupporting user-agents to construct a\nURL using the query mechanism.\nThe query mechanism would therefore give us the added benefit of allowing\neither the user to specifiy the\nversion identifier via a form element *or* the author to \"hardcode\" the\nversion identifier into the URL within\nthe tag (anchor,img etc...).\nSo, I'd say the query mechanism looks slightly more preferable.\n\n- Scot\n\n--\n======================================================================\nScot Malloy                      E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:malloys@documentum.com\">malloys@documentum.com</a>\nDocumentum, Inc.
