The algorithm exploits \r\nthe structure of the constraint network and is most efficient for near-tree problem domains. \r\nBy analyzing the structure of the problem domain, the performance of such algorithms can be \r\nbounded in advance. We present empirical results comparing SAB with two model-based algorithms, \r\nMBD1 and MBD2, for the task of finding one or all minimal-cardinality diagnosis. MBD1 uses the \r\nsame computing strategy as algorithm GDE [9]. MBD2 adopts a breadth-first search strategy \r\nsimilar to the algorithm DIAGNOSE [24]. The main conclusion is that for nearly acyclic circuits, \r\nsuch as the N-bit adder, the performance of SAB being linear provides definite advantages as the \r\nsize of the circuit increases.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r27-diag-tree-decomp-circuits.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r27-diag-tree-decomp-circuits.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8580.0}
