We categorize existing algorithms by <b>how</b>, <b>where</b>, and <b>when</b> they estimate the metric tensor. We also extend the taxonomy along each axis. <b>How</b>: We introduce hybrid algorithms that use a combination of techniques to ameliorate over-fitting. <b>Where</b>: We present an exact polynomial time algorithm to integrate the metric tensor along the lines between the test and training points under the assumption that the metric tensor is piecewise constant. <b>When</b>: We propose an interpolation algorithm where the metric tensor is sampled at a number of references points during the offline phase. The reference points are then interpolated during the online classification phase. We also present a comprehensive evaluation on tasks in face recognition, object recognition, and digit recognition. </p>\n<br>\n<p> D. Ramanan, S.
