Novel infrastructure security services are\nneeded for\nthe successful operation of a coalition across multiple domains.\nCertificate\nmanagement is especially challenging in a dynamic real-time\nenvironment.\nAlso, scalability and integration across domains should be\nefficiently supported.\n\n<p>\nTraditional certificate management schemes use certificate\nrevocation\nlists maintained by certificate authorities. This approach requires\nthe entire\nsigned list to be transmitted to any user who requests certificate\nvalidation.\nWhile this approach is secure and is being deployed in practice, it\nrequires\nsubstantial (linear size) communication overhead and is not a\nscalable solution for dynamic coalitions.\n\n<p>\nExtending preliminary work on the subject, this project developed a\nnovel certificate revocation scheme in Java that supports fast\nlanguage and platform independent certificate verification \nand small communication overhead.\n\n\n<p>\n<h3>Papers </h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nM.
