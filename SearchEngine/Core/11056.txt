Higher dimensional generalizations in which the Voronoi cells form zonotopes are much harder one can find a basis of short vectors using the well known LLL algorithm but this doesn t necessarily find

This problem is closely related to some important\nnumber theory: Euclid's algorithm for integer GCD's, continued\nfractions, and good approximations of real numbers by rationals.\nHigher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form\nzonotopes) are much harder -- one can find a basis of\nshort vectors using the well-known LLL algorithm, but this doesn't\nnecessarily find\nthe vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according\nto Senechal's <I>Quasicrystals and Geometry</I>, although the set\nof Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not\nknown whether this set always contains a basis.)\n<P>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/csk/tile/voronoi.html\">Voronoi\ndiagrams and ornamental design</a>.\n<p>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.voronoigame.com/\">The Voronoi Game</a>.\nDescription, articles, references, and demonstration applet on\nproblems of competitive facility location, where two players place\nsites in hopes of being nearest to as much area as possible.\nSee also\n<a href=\"http://home.dti.net/crispy/Voronoi.html\">Crispy's\nVoronoi game applet</a>\nand <a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall04/G22.2965-001/voronoi.html\">Dennis\nShasha's Voronoi game page</a>.\n<p>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/wallpaper/seventeen.html\">Wallpaper groups</A>.
