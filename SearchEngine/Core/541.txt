The focus is often on collaboration to solve problems of mutual \ninterest. In some cases companies financially sponsor a specific research \nproject which is conducted at UCI. In some cases the focus is on transitioning \ntechnology to the company.  Other projects may focus on UCI usage of \ncorporate technology. Still others are directed at site visits for information \nexchange, consulting, or arranging summer internships for students. \n\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n<HR>\n<h2> Schedule of Events, Flyers, Mailing Lists </h2>\n\nThe IRUS \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/schedule.html\">schedule of events</A>\nincludes flyers for SPIN, BART, symposia, and other\nspecial events. \n<p>\nFlyers are also available directly via the IRUS\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/mailing_lists.html\">\nelectronic and postal mailing lists.</A>\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to the IRUS home page</A>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n\n", "id": 541.0}
