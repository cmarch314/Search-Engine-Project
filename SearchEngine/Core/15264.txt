These packings are useful in a number of applications\nincluding\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-cpack.html\">mesh\ngeneration</A> and conformal mapping.\n\n<P>One drawback of circle packings, though, is that they seem to be very\nrigid: it is hard to change a small portion of a circle packing while\nleaving the rest of it alone.  This is in contrast to some other\ngeometric structures such as <I>quadtrees</I>, which are formed by\nrepeatedly subdividing squares into quarters:\n<P>\n<CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"qt.gif\" WIDTH=467 HEIGHT=467 ALT=\"\">\n</CENTER>\n<P>\nAn advantage of the way quadtrees are constructed is that we can vary\nthe local density: in some regions we can have very small squares, while\nother regions can be covered by very large squares.  This is even\npossible while allowing relatively smooth gradations between adjacent squares\n(for instance only allowing a square to be adjacent to others between\nhalf and twice its size).\n<P>\nWhat I would like to discover is a similarly flexible structure for\ncircle packings.  Is there a way of constructing circle packings\nsuch that (1) each circle is tangent only to others within a constant\nfactor of its size, and (2) if are given a sufficiently smoothly varying\n\"local density function\" f(x,y), the circle containing a point (x,y) has size\nproportional to f(x,y)?\n<P>\nIt is possible to define circle packings that vary smoothly in one direction:\n<P>\n<CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"cpack.gif\" WIDTH=484 HEIGHT=417 ALT=\"\">\n</CENTER>\n<P>\nSo e.g. if f(x,y) depends only on y, but not on x, the problem can be solved.\nWhat about more general local density functions?\n<P>\nWhile mathematicians have studied circle packings for some time,\nthey have not been paid much attention by computational geometry,\nand one can also ask many other interesting questions about them.\nFor instance, if we are given a finite collection of circles,\nhow quickly can we determine whether they can be extended to a circle packing?\nIs this question even decidable?\n\n<P>See my web essay \"<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/tangencies/\">Tangencies</A>\"\nfor some basic techniques of constructing certain patterns of circle\ntangencies, that may be helpful in solving these problems.\n<P>\n<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/tangencies/\"><IMG\nSRC=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/tangencies/ringel.gif\" WIDTH=373 HEIGHT=330\nBORDER=0 ALT=\"Five-chromatic tangent circles\"></A></DIV>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 15264.0}
