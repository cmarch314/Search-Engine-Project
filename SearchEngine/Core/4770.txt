It\r\nfeatures a fully integrated flexible processing workflow comprising\r\nboth well-known and novel data analysis tools, including SNP\r\nclustering, erroneous data filtering, exact and approximate LOD\r\ncalculations, and maximum-likelihood haplotyping. The system draws\r\nits power from thousands of CPUs, performing data analysis tasks\r\norders of magnitude faster than a single computer. By providing\r\nan intuitive interface to sophisticated state-of-the-art analysis tools\r\ncoupled with high computing capacity, Superlink-Online SNP helps\r\ngeneticists unleash the potential of SNP data for detecting disease\r\ngenes.<br>\r\n\r\n<b>Results:</b> Computations performed by Superlink-Online SNP are\r\nautomatically parallelized using novel paradigms, and executed on\r\nunlimited number of private or public CPUs. One novel service\r\nis large-scale approximate Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC)\r\nanalysis. The accuracy of the results is reliably estimated by running\r\nthe same computation on multiple CPUs and evaluating the Gelman-\r\nRubin Score to set aside unreliable results. Another service within\r\nthe workflow is a novel parallelized exact algorithm for inferring\r\nmaximum-likelihood haplotyping. The reported system enables\r\ngenetic analyses that were previously infeasible. We demonstrate the\r\nsystem capabilities via a study of a large complex pedigree affected\r\nwith metabolic syndrome.<br>\r\n\r\n<b>Availability:</b> Superlink-Online SNP is freely available for researchers\r\nat http://cbl-hap.cs.technion.ac.il/superlink-snp .
