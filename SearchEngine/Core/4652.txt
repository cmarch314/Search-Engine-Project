{"text": "Informatics 42 Department of Informatics UC Irvine Winter 2 5 INFORMATICS CORE COURSE II COURSE REFERENCE Instructor David G Kay 4 6B Computer Science kay uci edu Teaching assistant Jeff Ridenour jridenou ics uci edu Course goals As the middle course in the first year sequence this course continues to focus on software design from a variety of approaches to modeling problems to the alternatives and tradeoffs of data structure design and implementation to analyzing the performance of those data structures and the associated algorithms We could call these three themes design How do we represent our problem so we can solve it with software implementation How do we decide which of the many alternatives would be best for building this solution and communication How can we characterize our solution especially its efficiency in consuming machine resources under various conditions in a way that other informaticians will understand Prerequisite concepts This course expects Informatics 41 as a prerequisite Meeting place and times Lecture meets six hours each week Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 to 12 2 in SSTR 1 1 and also from 2 to 3 2 in ELH 11 Discussion and lab section meets Monday Wednesday and Friday from 2 to 3 5 in CS 192 Most of your lab work will be done in pairs so you should plan to attend the scheduled lab times to work with your partner Office hours You are welcome to drop by my office at any time If I m there and not immersed in something else I ll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours during which course related matters will have first priority Wednesdays from 11 3 to 12 2 and Thursdays from 12 45 to 1 15 Of course emergencies may come up but I will try to give advance notice of any change I ll also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week The quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail as described below Questions and announcements You can usually get a response to your course related questions within a few hours a bit less frequently on the weekends by sending electronic mail to the ID i42 uci edu This goes to both of us and whoever reads it first can respond If you need to reach one of us individually use our individual IDs listed above We may also send course announcements by Email to the official course mailing list so you should check your Email regularly Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar has for you your UCInet ID If you prefer to read your Email on another account you should see http phwww cwis uci edu cgi bin phupdate to update your UCInet account to forward Email to your preferred account Don t let this slide if you miss official announcements your grade could suffer This course s web page at http e3 uci edu 5w 37 which you can reach more mnemonically from the instructor s home page http www ics uci edu kay official course Email is archived at http e3 uci edu 5w w3m3 37 and a course Note Board for student to student discussions is available when you log on to eee uci edu We don t use a news group for this course Textbook Data Structures and Algorithms in Java third edition by Goodrich and Tamassia This text has a web site at http java datastructures net It contains a variety of useful information but not the complete text of the book Labs and lab hours Of course you will need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday Wednesday Friday lab hours Students in Informatics 42 may use any of the school s instructional computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the lab exclusively See http www ics uci edu lab for lab hours and other information Note in particular that all ICS labs are closed on university holidays Please remember that programming tasks always take longer to complete than you think they will no matter how much experience you have You must account for this as you plan your time we cannot accept busy schedules or time mismanagement as an excuse for late or incomplete assignments Programming language For most of the work in this course we will be using the current version of Java Java 5 which is sometimes also referred to as Java 1 5 It provides enough advantages over the previous version Java 1 4 2 that we are requiring it for all the Java programming this quarter The machines in our lab all use this version If you wish to work from home you can find instructions about obtaining and installing it on Alex Thornton s page http www ics uci edu thornton ics22 LabManual SettingUpJava html Other useful addresses We may distribute some course materials at the Engineering Copy Center ECC in Engineering Tower 2 3 the ECC is open 8 12 and 1 4 3 Monday through Friday Course structure Homework and lab assignments some on paper and some on line 25 of the course grade All the assignments will be available at http www ics uci edu kay courses i42 hw Class participation Based primarily on participating consistently in the lab 1 Weekly quizzes Given in lecture every Tuesday morning at 11 3 together One final exam On Tuesday March 22 from 1 3 a m to 12 3 p m 35 We determine final grades neither on a formal curve with equal numbers of As and Fs Bs and Ds etc nor on a fixed straight scale Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been significantly lower this means that you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates If you re concerned check with your TA or the instructor The basic scale is grades in the A range A A and in exceptional cases A 9 and above grades in the B range 8 9 grades in the C range 7 8 Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating your work go to him first for any questions about grading or scoring If that does not resolve your question then see the instructor The TA and instructor will be happy to correct any errors that do occur but we must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the item is returned the course moves quickly and we simply can t deal with assignments long past We re required to say that in unusual circumstances these criteria could change but we do not expect that to happen What to do this week to get started in Informatics 42 If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your UCInet account redirect your mail at http phwww cwis uci edu cgi bin phupdate On the Web go to checkmate ics uci edu log in with your UCInet ID choose the Winter 2 5 quarter if it s not already selected click Course Listing click Go next to Informatics 42 and then click List me for this course You ll submit some of your work electronically this step is necessary to set that up Get a lab printing key card if you want to print things in the lab Good advice and helpful hints Make every effort to attend the lectures even more often than last quarter we will cover material that isn t directly in the textbooks It s not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed though of course he will answer questions about it Attend your discussion and lab section too assignments will be discussed and completed there exams will be reviewed there and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture Don t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you Since much of your work will be done with a partner your partner also depends on your consistent presence Check your electronic mail regularly this is an official channel for course announcements Keep up with the reading you ll need it to do your assignments and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you re not careful Our text contains some details that won t be vital for your work You will want to read the assigned sections early and quickly for the main ideas not to memorize every detail then you can ask your TA in section which parts merit closer attention The assignments like all technical specifications require careful and thorough reading and re reading Expect to refer back to the assignment often and check it first when you have questions about what s required or how to proceed Before you come to lab be sure to read the assignment to get an idea of what s required Start each assignment early Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will even if you have previous programming experience By starting early you ll have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter If you find yourself having trouble or getting behind speak with your TA or the instructor But never take the shortcut of copying someone else s work and turning it in the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment ICS takes academic honesty very seriously for a more complete discussion see the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty issues http www ics uci edu ugrad current policies index php Always keep your own copy of each assignment both electronically and on paper if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle or if a file server in the lab should crash which has happened we ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily Finally turn in whatever portion of the assignment you have completed on the due date In some circumstances you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the due date but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date comes Approximate course
