{"text": "Course Library Installation and Use for Eclipse C Instructions These instructions explain how to install the course library folder courselib in Eclipse C Then they explain how to create a project that uses the library At various times during the quarter you may be asked to replace various hpp or cpp files and recompile the library Courselib Installation Download and unzip the courselib zip file the result is a courselib folder Locate the workspace folder typically C Users yourname workspace and put the courselib folder you downloaded and unzipped into this workspace folder The courselib folder contains course specific C hpp and cpp files that are usable in all C projects in Eclipse Select File New C Project as follow Create a new C Shared Library project in the C Project popup window Project Name is courselib There will be a warning at the top Directory with specified name already exists Specify Project type by disclosing Shared Library and selecting Empty Project Specify Toolchains by selecting MinGW GCC The C Project popup window should appear as follows Click Finish Right click the courselib icon in the Project Explorer tab Select Properties which appears as the bottom as follows In the Properties for courselib popup window Under type filter text disclose C C Build and Select Settings Under the Tool Settings tab under GCC C Compiler select Miscellaneous In the Other flags textbox type std gnu 11 at the end The Properties for courselib popup window should appear as shown below Click OK Either click the Hammer icon or right click the courselib icon in the Project Explorer tab and select Build Project The Console window should show the following If you diclose the main icons under the courselib icon in the Project Explorer tab you will see the following You can also look in the Debug src and src folders to see their o and hpp ccp files respectively Future projects that you create will use the library folder and you will have to move the libcourselib dll file created here into those projects Later in the quarter you will be asked to study the code in the hpp cpp files here for your programming assignments If when you are done looking now elide all these icons leaving just the courselib icon In the future you will likely be asked to download new or improved corrected hpp cpp files move them into the library build a new libcourselib dll file and use that file in future projects Courselib Use Creating a Project that Uses the Courselib Select File New C Project as shown in step 3 above to create a new project either from an empty one or one from a downloaded unzipped folder In this example create an empty one Create a new C Executable project in the C Project popup window Project Name is test set Specify Project type by disclosing Executable and selecting Empty Project probably the defaults Specify Toolchains by selecting MinGW GCC The C Project popup window should appear as follows Click Finish Right click the test set icon in the Project Explorer tab as shown in step 5 above Select Properties as shown in step 6 above In the Properties for test set popup window Under type filter text disclose C C Build and Select Settings Under the Tool Settings tab under GCC C Compiler select Miscellaneous In the Other flags textbox type std gnu 11 at the end The Properties for test set popup window should appear as shown below Click Apply Under the Tool Settings tab under GCC C Compiler select Includes In the Include paths I pane click the add icon In the Add directory path popup window click the Workspace button In the Folder selection popup window disclose courselib and select the src folder The popup windows should appear as follows Click OK in the Folder selection popup window The Add directory path

test set popup window should appear as follows Click Apply Click OK Right click the test set icon in the Project Explorer tab and select New Source Folder which appears as as follows In the Folder name textbox of the New Source Folder popup window type src which appears as follows Click Finish Disclose the test set icon in the Project Explorer which appears as follows Right click the src icon in the test set icon in the Project Explorer tab and select New Source File which appears as as follows In the Source File textbox of the New Source File popup window type driver cpp which appears as follows Click Finish Disclose the the comment in the driver cpp editor tab and copy paste the following code starting on line 9 include driver set hpp int main ics DriverSet d return The driver cpp editor tab appears as follows Either click the Hammer icon or right click in the test set icon in the Project Explorer tab and select Build Project The Console window should show the following Copy the libcourselib dll file from the the Debug folder in the courselib folder in the workspace to the Debug folder in the test set folder in the workspace You will have to do this once for every project If you disclose everything in the test set icon it should show the following You can elide the Debug folder Either click the Run icon or right click in the driver cpp editor tab and select select Run As 1 Local C C Application illustrated below The program should begin running and the Console window should show the following You can enter commands to test the sets a topic we will cover soon You can also either click the Debug icon or right click in the driver cpp editor tab and select select select Debug As 1 Local C C Application to run this program under the Eclipse debugger To simplify the edit build recompile debug loop perform the following operation after completing it clicking Build or Run will automatically save the contents of any edited file before the program is rebuilt and run Select Window Preferences In the Preferences popup window disclose General and select Workspace Click Save automatically before build checkbox as follows Click Apply In the Preferences popup window disclose Run Debug and select Launching In the Save required dirty editors before launching section click the Always radio button as follows Click Apply Click OK On your home machine you will never have to peform this step again in the lab must peform it every time that you log on Practice all these steps a few times so that you are familiar with creating new projects that use the course
