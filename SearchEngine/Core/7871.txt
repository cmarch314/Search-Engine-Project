Sequential applications or sequential portions of parallel applications\nrequire further advances to improve their performance. Today's OOO processors complete instructions in their program\norder, which is a major performance bottleneck because any long-latency instruction, such as access to memory,\ndelays the completion of all subsequent instructions. This project aims to achieve higher single core performance\nby defining a new, compiler assisted mechanism for out of order instruction completion. It investigates how the\nuse of compile-time program knowledge can be passed to the hardware and be used to simplify the architectural\nchecks required for such out of order completion. The architecture of a standard processor will be fully preserved\nand legacy software can execute without modification.\n<br>\n<br>\nSupported by the National Science Foundation\n</dir>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "id": 7871.0}
