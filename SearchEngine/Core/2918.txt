{"text": " Courses I teach Spring 2 14 ICS 263 Computerization Work and Organizations ICS 263 SYLLABUS Spring 2 14 This course is intended to generate understanding of the philosophical theoretical and empirical foundations of the social study of technology in organizations The course involves consideration and discussion of the research literature that includes a range of social phenomena surrounding the development implementation use and implications of technology in organizations A particular focus of the discussions will be an examination of the research assumptions guiding the theoretical ideas and empirical studies conducted in this field The readings in this course follow a trajectory from readings that will help us understand research assumptions underlying studies in technology and organizations to a variety of theoretical frameworks applied to studies of technology in organizations and empirical examples of research conducted from the perspective of different research methods assumptions and theoretical perspectives This course would be useful for graduate students doing sociological and anthropological work in organizations Even if one s research focus does not directly focus on technology more and more core organizational processes and routines happen via information technologies Therefore developing frameworks to understand the relationship between technological infrastructure and assumptions and organizational processes is important for scholars across disciplinary traditions 1cS 2 7S Doctoral Research and Writing Seminar ICS 2 7 Overview The goal of the seminar is to provide students with milestones for getting some sort of product out to the group and a rhythm for writing and thinking It also engenders shared understanding of what your colleagues are engaged in and hopefully becomes a site for productive cross over in ideas literature and writing tips This workshop is geared toward students that are actively working on their own work and research stream Winter 2 14 1cS 2 7S Doctoral Research and Writing Seminar Spring 2 13 1cS 161 Materialities of Information with Paul Dourish COURSE WEBSITE housed on Paul Dourish s webpage The goal of this class is to bring recent interests arising in anthropology science studies media studies and organization studies in the topic of materiality into conversation with informatics and the study of the digital The key insight that we would like to develop is that the materiality of information goes beyond an interest in the artifacts of information infrastructure but has insight to offer too for the constitution and consequences of digitality Together we will explore a range of perspectives on the materiality of information including questions of material culture digital representational practice the informational substrate networks and spatially and the infrastructure of digital political economy We will do this by reading both instructor selected and student select materials in juxtaposition hoping for a broad and productive interdisciplinary engagement Fall 2 12 1cS 161 Social Analysis of Computerization ICS 161 SYLLABUS Fall 2 12 technology disconnect

Implications of Technologies in Use ICS 163 SYLLABUS Spring 2 11 Website must have a UCI ID to access The objective of the course is to provide practical experience in researching social and organizational implications of technology Emphasis will be placed on conducting ethnographic research writing and presenting You will be part of a team project analyzing organizational process and technology in use at a local business non profit organization or service at UCI First you will learn about how to design an empirical study Even though you have learned some of this in 161 and 162 this practicum will help you engage that material in the empirical world What question are you trying to answer How should you go about attempting to answer these questions What other factors do you need to consider when engaging in empirical research Second you will learn how to gather data about people s social and cultural environments Techniques will include observing social dynamics interviewing people and analyzing technologies in use We will also discuss other techniques such as organizational documents artifact analysis and journals and logs For each technique you will learn what types of question it can answer how to go about using it and how does it influence your study design Third you will learn how to analyze the data that you collect Analysis is the process of taking the data that you gather and turning into a systematic set of findings that let you make claims For example analysis lets you say how and why an organizational process is effective or ineffective for the users or whether software needs to work a certain way in order to meet the needs of potential users We will learn how to perform analysis on the types of data that you ve just learned how to collect The goal of this class is to provide you with an introduction to how to use empirical methods and engage in data analysis to provide insight into organizational processes and technologies in use At the end of this class you should be able to design a study that allows you to take a research question and answer it using appropriate data collection and analysis techniques

Computerization ICS 295 The connected mediated and wired self Exploring social identity in the information age ICS 295 SYLLABUS Spring 2 1 This seminar asks students to explore how they develop maintain and assert a sense of themselves through ongoing interactions This course will rely on course readings active discussion and a collective interview project to evoke questions about who we are and are able to be in an increasingly technologically mediated social environment This seminar is intended to generate understandings of the origins of symbolic interactionist social identity and social constructivist theories of the self and inspire questions about how these perspectives translate into the current era of pervasive communication and information saturation graduate Copyright 2

Topics include: computerization as providing new ways of \u201cseeing\u201d; information archiving, search and locating; privacy; environmental implications of IT; the \u2018self\u2019 in a connected world; financial markets in the information age; community based research and informatics; and games and virtual worlds.<br /></p>\n                  <p style=\"padding-top: 3px; \" class=\"paragraph_style_15\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_5\">1cS 207: <span class=\"style\">Research and Writing Seminar<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_6\"><a title=\"Courses_files/Informatics 207_overview_1.docx\" href=\"Courses_files/Informatics%20207_overview_1.docx\" class=\"style\">ICS 207 Overview</a><span class=\"style\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">The goal of the seminar is to provide students with milestones for getting some sort of 'product' out to the group and a rhythm for writing and thinking. It also engenders shared understanding of what your colleagues' are engaged in and hopefully becomes a site for productive cross-over in ideas, literature, and writing tips. This workshop is geared toward students that are actively working on their own work and research stream.<span class=\"style_1\"> </span>\u00a0<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_15\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style\">Spring, 2011<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_5\">ICS 163: <span class=\"style\">Projects in the Social and Organizational Implications of Technologies-in-Use<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_16\"><a title=\"Courses_files/163_Syllabus_online.doc\" href=\"Courses_files/163_Syllabus_online.doc\" style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_5\">ICS 163 SYLLABUS, Spring 2011</a><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_5\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_16\"><a onclick=\"window.open(this.href); return false;\" title=\"https://eee.uci.edu/11s/37100\" href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/11s/37100\" onkeypress=\"window.open(this.href); return false;\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px; \" class=\"style_5\">Website (must have a UCI ID to access)</span><br /></a></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_17\">The objective of the course is to provide practical experience in researching social and organizational implications of technology. Emphasis will be placed on conducting ethnographic research, writing, and presenting. You will be part of a team project analyzing organizational process and technology-in-use at a local business, non-profit organization or service at UCI. <br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_18\">First, you will learn about how to design an empirical study.\u00a0 Even though, you have learned some of this in 161 and 162, this <span class=\"style_6\">practicum</span> will help you engage that material in the empirical world.<br /> What question are you trying to answer?\u00a0 How should you go about attempting to answer these questions?\u00a0 What other factors do you need to consider when engaging in empirical research?\u00a0<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_18\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_18\">Second, you will learn how to gather data about people\u2019s social and cultural environments.<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_19\">Techniques will include observing social dynamics, interviewing people, and analyzing technologies-in-use. We will also discuss other techniques such as organizational documents, artifact analysis, and journals and logs.\u00a0For each technique you will learn what types of question it can answer, how to go about using it, and how does it influence your study design.<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_19\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_18\">Third, you will learn how to analyze the data that you collect.<br />Analysis is the process of taking the data that you gather and turning into a systematic set of findings that let you make claims.\u00a0For example, analysis lets you say how and why an organizational process is effective or ineffective for the users or whether software needs to work a certain way in order to meet the needs of potential users.\u00a0We will learn how to perform analysis on the types of data that you\u2019ve just learned how to collect.<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_19\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_17\">The goal of this class is to provide you with an introduction to how to use empirical methods and engage in data analysis to provide insight into organizational processes and technologies in-use.<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_4\">At the end of this class you should be able to design a study that allows you to take a research question and answer it using appropriate data collection and analysis techniques.<span class=\"style_7\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_16\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_5\">1cS 161: <span class=\"style\">Social Analysis of Computerization<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_13\"><a title=\"Courses_files/161_syllabus_online.docx\" href=\"Courses_files/161_syllabus_online.docx\" class=\"style\">ICS 161 SYLLABUS, Spring 2011<br /></a></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_20\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style\">Winter, 2011<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\">ICS 263: <span class=\"style\">Computerization, Work and Organizations<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_21\"><a class=\"class2\" title=\"Courses_files/Mazmanian_263_syllabus_Win_11.docx\" href=\"Courses_files/Mazmanian_263_syllabus_Win_11.docx\">ICS 263 SYLLABUS, Winter 2011<br /></a></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_22\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style\">SPRING, 2010<br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\">ICS 161: <span class=\"style\">Social Analysis of Computerization</span><span style=\"line-height: 13px; \" class=\"style_8\"><br /></span></p>\n                  <p style=\"padding-top: 0px; \" class=\"paragraph_style_15\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_1\">ICS 295: <span class=\"style\">The connected, mediated and wired self: Exploring social identity in the information age<br /></span></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\"><a title=\"Courses_files/295_syllabus.docx\" href=\"Courses_files/295_syllabus.docx\">ICS 295 SYLLABUS, Spring 2010</a><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_3\"><br /></p>\n                  <p class=\"paragraph_style_4\">This seminar asks students to explore how they develop, maintain, and assert a sense of themselves through ongoing interactions. This course will rely on course readings, active discussion, and a collective interview project to evoke questions about who we are - and are able to be - in an increasingly technologically mediated social environment. This seminar is intended to generate understandings of the origins of symbolic interactionist, social identity, and social constructivist theories of the self, and inspire questions about how these perspectives translate into the current era of pervasive communication and information saturation (graduate).<br /></p>\n                  <p style=\"padding-bottom: 0pt; \" class=\"Title\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"height: 3169px; line-height: 3169px; \" class=\"spacer\">\u00a0</div>\n          </div>\n          <div style=\"height: 150px; margin-left: 0px; position: relative; width: 700px; z-index: 15; \" id=\"footer_layer\">\n            <div style=\"height: 0px; line-height: 0px; \" class=\"bumper\">\u00a0</div>\n            <div id=\"id3\" style=\"height: 33px; left: 474px; position: absolute; top: 13px; width: 208px; z-index: 1; \" class=\"style_SkipStroke_3 shape-with-text\">\n              <div class=\"text-content style_External_208_33\" style=\"padding: 0px; \">\n                <div class=\"style_9\">\n                  <p style=\"padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; \" class=\"paragraph_style_23\">Copyright 2014: Melissa Mazmanian</p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\n", "id": 2918.0}
