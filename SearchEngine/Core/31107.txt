A subweb is a hyperweb which inherits all \nanchors and links from the web it was created from.  The subweb\nis made the child of the original web in the hierarchy or\nwebs.\n</p>\n\n<p>The creation of webs is controlled at the \nChimera Website.  The following example creates a new web below the \nflight_web used in the previous example.  \n</p>\n\n\n<H3>Creating a Subweb below the flight_web</H3>\n\n<p> The actions of creating and deleting webs is controlled at the\nChimera Website through the Hyperweb Manager.
