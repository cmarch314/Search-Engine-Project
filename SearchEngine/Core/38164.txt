management behavior of 5 emph mobile instant messaging IM users The motivation for this study was 6 to inform the design of interface tools which support users in setting 7 contextually appropriate awareness messages Our results demonstrate that many 8 desktop IM practices have been appropriated by mobile users but in the face of 9 increasingly situated computer usage and an always online culture common 1 interpretations of awareness cues are failing Users are frequently embarrassed 11 and interrupted with negative consequences as a result of impoverished and 12 incorrectly interpreted contextual information 5 emph mobile instant messaging IM users with emph existing systems The 6motivation for this study was to inform the design of interface tools that 7support users by setting contextually appropriate awareness messages Our 8results demonstrate that many desktop IM practices have been appropriated by 9mobile users but in the face of increasingly situated computer usage and an 1 always online culture several frictions are emerging between desktop and 11mobile practices We find that common assumptions about IM users and the 12established awareness cues are failing and users are frequently embarrassed and 13interrupted with negative and sometimes threatening consequences 1314 1415 end abstract nomatic trunk 2 8 4 4 UBICOMP conclusions tex r961 r962 1212is breaking the assumption that a communication buddy can discretely receive an 1313IM from a user The result is that a large proportion of our participants had 14 been involved in an embarrassing incident while using IM on a semi public 15 display The implication for tool design is that revealing information about 14been involved in an embarrassing incident while using IM in a semi public 15circumstance The implication for tool design is that revealing information about 1616the public or private nature of a user s current context would alleviate some of 1717this friction 2 2 of a private stationary physical desktop The practice of leaving IM s for a 2121buddy on their screen which they will attend to when they return is no longer 22 an appropriate model Instead these messages are distraction enough that users 23 are being forced to turn off IM entirely in order to get work done The 22an appropriate model Instead these messages are distracting enough that users 23are being forced to turn off IM entirely in order to accomplish their goals The 2424implication for context setting is that the status lines must be believed to be 2525accurate by buddies in order for them to mitigate interruptions It is probably 3737users to time shift their communication to a more appropriate moment 3838 39 Custom status prediction form mobile users is largely about activity place and 4
