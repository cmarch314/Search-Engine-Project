you ve received personal emails I ll jump in Your reasoning is valid only if your GIS is to serve merely as a viewable one e g clicking on a street and presenting the information as you cite as an example However if you want to perfom other tasks such as geocoding 911 incident location etc you need a more detailed address structure For example you are given a dataset of recent fires including an address date and amount of damage You want to create a GIS point data set in order to determine whether a new distribution of fire stations could have alleviated the destruction Unfortunately the fire dataset was typed in by an insurance salesman who was not aware of your address conventions So the list looks like 12 West Av 1 2 94 1 12 2 West 1 2 94 8 1 Lafayette 3 16 95 2 98A W Tyler St 5 2 95 1 98 B Tyler St 5 2 95 2 1322 Bell Rd 6 14 95 75 16 Mayfield unknown 45 14 Bell Street 6 2 95 6 As you see there are several inconsistant addresses that your complete address will not catch Without the address fields parsed out your GIS may have West Avenue so neither of the first two records will match If Lafayette is really Lafayette Square again there is no match Which Bell is correct With distinct fields you can at least find all the Bell street names and make the determination Particularly if your area has similar street names with different types such as the Bell example or East West or North South prefixes expect that incoming data from other agencies will be inconsistant with respect to these address components Finally most commercial geocoding algorithms use distinct fields to obtain near matches and to give more less weight to particular address components As a result you may be forced to split your fields anyway Part of Geometry in Action a collection of applications of

people think, and their end use \ndetermines much of the needed complexity: address matching, address lookup, \nspatial allocation, spatial analysis, thematic analysis, etc. all have special \naddress related characteristics.\n\nKeep in mind the fact that an address is only an identifier for one or more \nentities (land, structures, occupancies, events, etc.) over some range of \ntime. The address has to be associated with the thing(s) or events to which it \napplies in an explicit relationship. The name is not the thing it describes, \njust like John Smith could be several people and a good bottle of beer, 10310 \n102 Ave. NW, Edmonton, AB. T5J 2X6 could describe many different things \ndepending on context.\n\nRegarding the format of address fields: we have: SuiteName orSuiteNumber, \nHouseNumber, HouseNumberSuffix, (StreetName, StreetDirection, StreetType) or \n(StreetNumber, StreetNumberSuffix, StreetType), Quadrant. Beyond this there is \nhandling of municipality name, post code(ZIP in the US). Then there are \nNamedLocations which are often used as surrogate addresses.\n\nAs is pointed out in the earlier posting, Soundex or some other spelling and \nformat standardization is vital when using uncontrolled lists of addresses and \nattempting the match them up or link them to spatial locations.\n\nI would suggest that you look through the proceedings of URISA Conferences, \nwhere some 30 years of experience in the field are covered. Some authors are: \nP. Eichleberger, W. Hurst, W. Huxhold, and myself (J. Guthrie).\n\nCareful planning can result in flexible and powerful systems, \noversimplification can result in frustration and disappointment.\n\nIn article &lt;rplDLKDMI.FsE@netcom.com&gt;, <A HREF=\"mailto:rpl@netcom.com\">rpl@netcom.com</A> (Robert Laudati) wrote:\n&gt;John Lorenz (<A HREF=\"mailto:lorenz@netcom.com\">lorenz@netcom.com</A>) wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;: Personally, I don't see the need for so many fields.
