J. Richardson in\n<i>Proceeding of the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (I\nSSTA) </i>, Boston, June 1994.\n\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nFew would question that software testing is a necessary activity for \nassuring software quality, yet the typical testing process is a human \nintensive activity and as such, it is unproductive, error-prone, \nand often inadequately done. Moreover, testing is seldom given a \nprominent place in software development or maintenance processes, \nnor is it an integral part of them. Major productivity and quality \nenhancements can be achieved by automating the testing process through \ntool development and use and effectively incorporating it with development \nand maintenance processes. \n\nThe TAOS toolkit, Testing with Analysis and Oracle Support, provides \nsupport for the testing process. It includes tools that automate many \ntasks in the testing process, including management and persistence of \ntest artifacts and the relationships between those artifacts, test\ndevelopment, test execution, and test measurement. A unique aspect of \nTAOS is its support for test oracles and their use to verify behavioral \ncorrectness of test executions. TAOS also supports structural/dependence \ncoverage by measuring the adequacy of test criteria coverage and regression \ntesting by identifying tests associated or dependent upon modified software\nartifacts. This is accomplished by integrating the ProDAG toolset, \nProgram Dependence Analysis Graph, with TAOS. The combination of ProDAG \nand TAOS supports the use of program dependence analysis in testing, \ndebugging, and maintenance. \n\nThis paper describes the TAOS toolkit and its capabilities as well as \ntesting, debugging and maintenance processes based on program dependence \nanalysis. We also describe our experience with the toolkit and discuss \nour future plans. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:43:50 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 26151.0}
