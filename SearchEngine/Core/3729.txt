We use competitive analysis to study the relative performance\nof two best known algorithms for paging, LRU and FIFO. Sleator and\nTarjan proved that the competitive ratio of LRU and FIFO is <i>\nk</i>. In practice, however, LRU is known to perform much better\nthan FIFO. It is believed that the superiority of LRU can be\nattributed to locality of reference exhibited in request sequences.\nIn order to study this phenomenon, Borodin, Irani, Raghavan and\nSchieber refined the competitive approach by introducing the\nconcept of access graphs. They conjectured that the competitive\nratio of LRU on each access graph is less than or equal to the\ncompetitive ratio of FIFO. We will prove this conjecture.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3729.0}
