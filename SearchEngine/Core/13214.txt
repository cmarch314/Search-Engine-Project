The motivation is for wireless devices to\nprove that they are located within a target area by their ability to\ncommunicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).\nWe provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed\nfor several classes of polygons.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"auth.html\">Co-authors</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
