Atmospheric Administration US Department of Commerce Donor Dr Di Cook Department of Statistics Iowa State University dicook iastate edu Date Donated June 3 1999 Data Characteristics This data was collected with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean TAO array which was developed by the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere TOGA program The TAO array consists of nearly 7 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection understanding and prediction of seasonal to interannual climate variations originating in the tropics most notably those related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation ENSO cycles The moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory PMEL Each mooring measures air temperature relative humidity surface winds sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 5 meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents rainfall and solar radiation The data from the array and current updates can be viewed on the web at the this address The data consists of the following variables date latitude longitude zonal winds west east meridional winds south north relative humidity air temperature sea surface temperature and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 5 meters Data taken from the buoys from as early as 198 for some locations Other data that was taken in various locations are rainfall solar radiation current levels and subsurface temperatures Variable Characteristics The latitude and longitude in the data showed that the bouys moved around to different locations The latitude values stayed within a degree from the approximate location Yet the longitude values were sometimes as far as five degrees off of the approximate location Looking at the wind data both the zonal and meridional winds fluctuated between 1 m s and 1 m s The plot of the two wind variables showed no linear relationship Also the plots of each wind variable against the other three meteorolgical data showed no linear relationships The relative humidity values in the tropical Pacific were typically between 7 and 9 Both the air temperature and the sea surface temperature fluctuated between 2 and 3 degrees Celcius The plot of the two temperatures variables shows a positive linear relationship existing The two temperatures when each plotted against time also have similar plot designs Plots of the other meteorological variables against the temperature variables showed no linear relationship There are missing values in the data As mentioned earlier not all buoys are able to measure currents rainfall and solar radiation so these values are missing dependent on the individual buoy The amount of data available is also dependent on the buoy as certain buoys were commissioned earlier than others All readings were taken at the same time of day Other Relevant Information Background The El Nino Southern Oscillation ENSO cycle of 1982 1983 the strongest of the century created many problems throughout the world Parts of the world such as Peru and the Unites States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system i e the TAO array to support studies of large scale ocean atmosphere interactions on seasonal to interannual time scales The TAO array provides real time data to climate researchers weather prediction centers and scientists around the world Forcasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data These forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys along with drifting buoys volunteer ship temperature probes and sea level measurements Research Questions Research questions of interest include How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world How do the variables relate to each other Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data When performing an analysis of the data one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today s weather Data Format The data is stored in an ASCII files with one observation per line Spaces separate fields and periods denote missing values Past Usage This data was used in the American Statistical Association
