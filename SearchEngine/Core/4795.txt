Algorithms for computing approximations \r\nusing these languages were also proposed.\r\nUpon testing such approximations on artificially \r\ngenerated and real life data, it was immediately \r\nobserved that they yield numerous\r\nsuperfluous models. As a result, although certain \r\nentailment queries can be answered reliably, \r\nthese methods may be ineffective for a\r\nlarge class of membership queries.\r\nTo improve the approximation quality, we investigate \r\nhere the k-decomposition problem, that is, determining \r\nwhether a relation can be described by a disjunction of \r\nk tractable theories. The paper discusses the complexity of this\r\ntask, outlines several algorithms for computing\r\nboth exact and approximate k-decompositions,\r\nand evaluates the potential of this approach\r\nempirically. We focus on the class of tree constraint \r\nnetworks and Horn theories and report\r\nresults on artificially generated relations and\r\non three real life cases. Our experiments show\r\nthat for uniform random relations, the quality\r\nof upper bound approximations improves as k\r\nincreases. However, when we require very high\r\naccuracy, decomposition is not effective since k\r\ngrows linearly with the size of the data. When\r\nthe data comes from a near-tractable source,\r\nthe approach is useful. Experiments show that\r\nfor the King Rook King problem the generalizing \r\npower of such methods is comparable to\r\nthat of recently developed learning algorithms.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"r32-comp-rel-in2-disj.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"r32-comp-rel-in2-disj.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 4795.0}
