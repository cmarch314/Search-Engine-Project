in the plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by smooth paths in the drawing We define a variant of confluent drawing strict confluent drawing in which a smooth path between two vertices if it exists must be unique We show that it is NP complete to test whether such drawings exist in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open Additionally we show that finding outerplanar drawings in which the points are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it

an assignment of the angles 18 and 36 to the angles between adjacent edges we show how to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of the graph as a flat folding on a line As a consequence we can determine whether two dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be flattened The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of the graph can be folded

Previously superpatterns had\nbeen considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this\nto sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that\nthe 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the\nknown bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation\nsubclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.\nWe apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets\nof points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex\nplanar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct\nuniversal sets of size approximately <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4,\nand we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded\npathwidth.\n<p>\n<li><b>Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play\nplanarity</b>.<br>\nD.

We define a variant of\nconfluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path\nbetween two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.\nWe show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,\nin contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.\nAdditionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points\nare on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed\ncyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.\nWe use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which\nall tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.\n<p>\n<li><b>Convex-arc drawings of pseudolines</b>.<br>\nD.

In contrast, for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements, a\nlinear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary.\n<p>\n<li><b>Planar induced subgraphs of sparse graphs</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/glencora/\">G.

As a consequence, we can\ndetermine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be\nflattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of\nthe graph can be folded independently of the other faces.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"conf.html\">Conferences</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
