We present a methodology for\nview-invariant monocular 3D human pose tracking in man-made\nenvironments in which we assume that observed people move\non a known ground plane. First, we model 3D body poses\nand camera viewpoints with a low dimensional manifold and\nlearn a generative model of the silhouette from this manifold\nto a reduced set of training views. During the online stage,\n3D body poses are tracked using recursive Bayesian sampling\nconducted jointly over the scene's ground plane and the pose-\nviewpoint manifold. For each sample, the homography that\nrelates the corresponding training plane to the image points\nis calculated using the dominant 3D directions of the scene,\nthe sampled location on the ground plane and the sampled\ncamera view. Each regressed silhouette shape is projected using\nthis homographic transformation and matched in the image to\nestimate its likelihood. Our framework is able to track 3D human\nwalking poses in a 3D environment exploring only a 4 dimensional\nstate space with success. In our experimental evaluation, we\ndemonstrate the significant improvements of the homographic\nalignment over a commonly used similarity transformation and\nprovide quantitative pose tracking results for the monocular\nsequences with high perspective effect from the CAVIAR dataset.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/RogezRGO_Cybernetics_2013/RogezRGO_Cybernetics_2013.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nGr\u00e9gory Rogez, Jonathan Rihan, J.J.
