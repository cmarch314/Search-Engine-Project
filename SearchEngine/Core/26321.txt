Component reuse and substitutability, two \nkey aspects of large-scale development, must be planned for \nduring software design. Object-oriented (OO) type theory sup\nports reuse by structuring inter-component relationships and \nverifying those relationships through type checking in an \narchitecture definition language (ADL). In this paper, we iden\ntify the issues and discuss the ramifications of applying OO \ntype theory to the C2 architectural style. This work stems from \na series of experiments that were conducted to investigate com\nponent reuse and substitutability in C2. We also discuss the \nlimits of applicability of OO typing to C2 and how we \naddressed them in the C2 ADL.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Tue May 23 13:40:23 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 26321.0}
