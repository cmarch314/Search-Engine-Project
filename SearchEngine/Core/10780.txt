We introduce k-Lombardi drawings, in which\neach\nedge may be drawn with k circular arcs; we show that every graph has\na\nsmooth 2-Lombardi drawing and every planar graph has a smooth planar\n3-Lombardi drawing. We also investigate related topics connecting\nplanarity and Lombardi drawings.\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 10780.0}
