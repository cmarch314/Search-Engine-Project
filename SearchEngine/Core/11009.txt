R X R you should read the following article solomon golomb tiling with polyominoes journal of combinatorial theory volume 1 1966 pages 28 296 he considers all the above possibilities except for the three quarter plane as well as the possibility that the polyomino tiles a larger copy of itself from his examples it s clear that he allows the use of mirror images however the implications do not change under this interpretation here s the diagram of implications he gives rectangle v half strip v bent strip itself v quadrant strip quadrant strip half plane v plane v nothing most of the implications are immediate e g quadrant half plane since the half plane may be tiled with two quadrants the only non obvious implications are itself quadrant and bent strip quadrant strip i will leave these to the reader to prove if we add the three quarter plane we have the implications quadrant three quarter plane plane the first implication is immediate but i need the axiom of choice to deduce the second if anyone can prove the second without the axiom of choice please let me and sci math know as a hint try to prove that if a polyomino can cover an N by N square for all N no overlap and pieces may hang over the edges of the square then it tiles the plane i don t know if the implication three quarter plane half plane is valid but there are a number of potential implications that haven
