Experimental analysis shows that pairing\nheaps meet their intended purpose: they are quite efficient in practice;\nhowever, a precise amortized analysis of pairing heaps has proved\ndifficult. In this talk, I will discuss the pairing heap data structure\nand the progress that has been made toward its analysis. I conclude by\ndiscussing a variant of the pairing heap by Amr Elmasry (\"<a\nhref=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4130\">Pairing Heaps with Costless\nMeld</a>\", ESA 2010) that matches known lower bounds.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2396.0}
