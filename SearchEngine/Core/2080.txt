way if you begin and you only win by one move your win was an empty one It scored no points Your win was based solely on the fact that you got to play first I ve also been developing my strategy as the second player I find it helps tremendously to keep my outside stone back a little wait for the opponent to rush to the corner and then move my outside stone one step to the inside This allows me to slip my stone in behind his The added bonus is that I now have a wall two stones long in the next to last row Often the opponent if forced to move his stones the long way around to circumvent the wall my opponents seem reluctant to push the corner stone off the board even though it is now useless strategically Usually pushing off the corner stone will force me to separate my wall at some point simply because I will have run out of other moves This then allows the opponent to slip a stone between mine and he is back to the corner advantage though one line back from the actual corner OY I

enough to handle A complete table of legal positions on the original 3x3 board and who wins them left right first or second is on page 686 of Winning Ways No doubt one of the authors or perhaps Colin Vout computed it by hand This is small enough that you could easily compute an explicit winning strategy in a few milliseonds There s no need for AI when brute force will do Not surprisingly there are only three positions six if you count reflections along the diagonal that the second player wins with perfect play Hopefully my notation is obvious On a chess board 8x8 there are roughly 4 trillion 4 x 1 13 positions with all the stones on the board and a few more with one or more stones off the board which is just a little too large to store explicitly I d guess that most of these positions are trivial wins for one player or the other just run off the board as fast as possible ignoring the other player s moves entirely These positions could probably be identified just be counting distances to the goal There might be few enough interesting positions to store a complete winning strategy This is all just guessing I haven t actually tried I wouldn t expect the computer implementation to get

the flock has a larger field to run on Suppose we call N of M Dodgem the game played on an N x N board with M pieces on each side So regular Dodgem is 2 of 3 and you ve looked at 3 of 4 and 4 of 5 What about 3 of 5 3 of 6 A surer way of making the game drawless is to forbid repeated positions Thus the rule you lose if you prevent your opponent from moving is extended to to a position not encountered before I imagine this might have a chilling effect perhaps we might find the first player losing on some boards But it also makes the game much harder to analyze exhaustively Dan Hoey AIC

There aren't any surprises: 5x5 Dodgem, like 4x4 Dodgem, is\nstill a draw.  In fact, even the terrible move 1. b1-a1 is enough to\ndraw the 5x5 game.  (It loses on a 4x4 board.)\n\nAnyway, since I have the table, I should be able to answer most\nreasonably well-posed questions about the game.  Not surprisingly, as\nthe board gets larger the game seems to become more drawish: I think\nabout 40% of 5x5 positions are draws.\n\nIt must be true that NxN Dodgem is a draw for every N &gt; 3.  However,\nproving it would seem to be difficult.\n\n                                        David desJardins\n-- \nCopyright 1996 David desJardins.

(It loses on a 4x4 board.)\n\nWow, great work.  Of course, it would be more startling to see a board\nin which the second player can still draw after 1. (not b1-a1), a2-a1.\n\nIt seems to me that the reason the game gets so drawish is that\nmany sheepdogs can gang up on one sheep, forcing a draw even if the\nrest of the flock gets away.  Does this work even if the flock has a\nlarger field to run on?  Suppose we call N-of-M Dodgem the game played\non an N x N board with M pieces on each side.  So regular Dodgem is\n2-of-3 and you've looked at 3-of-4 and 4-of-5.  What about 3-of-5?\n3-of-6?\n\nA surer way of making the game drawless is to forbid repeated\npositions.  Thus the rule \"you lose if you prevent your opponent from\nmoving\" is extended to \"... to a position not encountered before.\"  I\nimagine this might have a chilling effect--perhaps we might find the\nfirst player losing on some boards.  But it also makes the game much\nharder to analyze exhaustively.\n\nDan\n<a href=\"mailto:Hoey@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil\">Hoey@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil</a>\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2080.0}
