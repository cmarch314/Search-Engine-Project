This paper considers DFAs in which the\ntransition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and\nshows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.\nIt also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.\nThere remains open a gap between <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>n<sup>3</sup></i>\nin the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.\n<p>(<a href=\"/~eppstein/bibs/eppstein.html#Reset sequences for monotonic automata\">BibTeX</a> --\n<a href=\"http://fano.ics.uci.edu/cites/Document/Reset-sequences-for-monotonic-automata.html\">Citations</a> --\n<a href=\"http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/eppstein90reset.html\">CiteSeer</a> --\n<a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=681434\">ACM DL (ICALP)</a> --\n<a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=80025\">ACM DL (SJC)</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Parallel algorithmic techniques for combinatorial computation</b>.<br>\nD.
