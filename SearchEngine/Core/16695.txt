These packages need to be installed prior to installing Chimera. In order for the Chimera&nbsp;2.0 servers to compile and execute correctly, the Java classes contained in these packages must be specified in the <TT>CLASSPATH</TT> environment variable.</P>\n\n<H3>Java Foundation Classes</H3>\n\n<P>The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are currently available from <A HREF=\"http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/index.html\">JavaSoft</A>. Eventually, the JFC will be merged into the standard Java Development Kit and the need for this separate download will go away. The JFC is currently at version 1.1 (Swing version 1.0.2). We test and develop Chimera using the &lt;<TT>swingall.jar</TT>&gt; file that comes with the JFC 1.1 download.</P>\n\n<H3>Rivendell Tool Server</H3>\n\n<P>The <A HREF=\"http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/Rivendell/\">Rivendell Tool Server</A> can be downloaded from the <A HREF=\"http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/\">Programming Systems Lab</A> at Columbia University. Rivendell is currently at version 0.6. In order to use Rivendell, two additional software packages must be obtained:</P>\n\n<UL>\n    <LI><A HREF=\"http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/\">HTTP Client</A>, version 0.3.</LI>\n    <LI><A HREF=\"http://jeeves.javasoft.com/products/java-server/downloads/index.html\">Java Servlet Development Kit</A>, version 1.0 or higher.</LI>\n</UL>\n\n<H3>AElfred XML Parser</H3>\n\n<P>A fast, compact XML parser from OpenText, Inc. This software package can be downloaded free of charge from <A HREF=\"http://www.opentext.com/services/content_management_services/xml_sgml_solutions.html#aelfred_and_sax\">OpenText's website</A>. The current version is 1.2a.</P>\n\n<!-- <P><FONT COLOR=\"red\">NOTE: Version 1.2 of AElfred comes with\na defective jar file. Do not use the jar file that is shipped with\nAElfred version 1.2. Instead, delete it, and recreate it by compiling\nthe Java classes that come with AElfred. (The SAXDriver.java class has\ntwo syntax errors in it. Fortunately, they are easy to fix. Send mail\nto <A HREF=\"mailto:kanderso@ics.uci.edu\">Ken Anderson</A> if you need\nhelp.) The author of AElfred has been notified of these problems but for\nsome reason has yet to respond to them.</FONT></P>\n-->\n\n<H3>Simple API for XML (SAX)</H3>\n\n<P>An interface shared by a variety of XML Parsers. If for some reason, \nAElfred becomes a thing of the past, Chimera can switch to using any\nSAX-Compliant XML parser to do its parsing. SAX can be downloaded from\n<A HREF=\"http://www.megginson.com/SAX/sax.html\">Megginson Technologies's website</A>\n.</P>\n          </TD>\n     </TR>\n</TABLE>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 16695.0}
