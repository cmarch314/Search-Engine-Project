There are <i>n</i>\nteams at the beginning of the\ntournament and in each round of the tournament teams are paired\nup and the games for each pair\nare simulated. Winners progress to the next round and losers\nare sent home. This continues until a grand champion team is the final\nwinner. Suppose your simulator takes <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) time to process\neach game. How much time does your simulator take in total?\n\n<li>\n<i>5 points.</i>\nGiven an integer <i>k</i> > 0 and an\narray, <i>A</i>, of <i>n</i> bits, describe an efficient algorithm\nfor finding\nthe shortest subarray of <i>A</i> that contains <i>k</i> 1's.\nWhat is the running time of your method?\n</ol>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "id": 16998.0}
