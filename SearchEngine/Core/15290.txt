{"text": "Layered Graph Drawing A planar graph is one that can be drawn in the plane with no crossing edges Planar graphs have been investigated for a long time and it is known F ry s theorem that any planar graph can be drawn in such a way that all edges are straight line segments But what can you do when a graph is not planar I and my co authors have been studying drawings in which the edges are grouped into layers shown here as colors such that no two edges in the same layer cross It turns out unlike for planar graphs that it makes a difference whether you require the edges to be straight line segments The minimum number of layers in a drawing if you allow curved edges is a well studied concept known as the thickness of the graph The minimum number of layers in a drawing with straight edges is a less well studied concept which we call the geometric thickness Complete Graphs The following drawing shows that the geometric thickness of the complete graph on twelve vertices K12 is at most three The central hexagon of this drawing is a little hard to see so here is a closer view The pattern used for this drawing can be generalized to show that for any n the graph Kn can be drawn in at most ceiling n 4 layers Eppstein et al JGAA 2 We also have a lower bound that at least n 5 646 layers are needed Since Kn is known to have n 6 layer drawings with curved edges this lower bound shows that geometric thickness is not the same concept as thickness The following table shows what we know about lower bounds and upper bounds for the number of layers required for complete graphs Kn

the resulting subdivided graph has geometric thickness two The following picture shows a drawing for K8 Interestingly a Ramsey theoretic argument shows that the book thickness of subdivisions of Kn is not bounded by any constant So there are graphs with geometric thickness two and arbitrarily large book thickness Eppstein 2 1 A very similar Ramsey theoretic argument applied to graphs formed by starting with n points and adding a new point adjacent to each triple of the n points shows that there are also graphs with thickness three and arbitrarily large geometric thickness Eppstein Contemp Math 2 4 Complete Bipartite Graphs In our JGAA 2 paper we also investigated the geometric thickness of complete bipartite graphs When a is much smaller than b the geometric thickness of Ka b is just a 2 but complete bipartite graphs in which both sides are of nearly equal size are more interesting For instance here is a two layer drawing of the complete bipartite graph K6 6 K1 n and K2 n are planar one layer and K3 n and K4 n always require exactly two layers so the first nontrivial cases are K5 n and K6 n K5 n requires two layers for n 8 and three layers for n 11 For 9 n 1 we don t know whether two or three layers are needed A drawing of K5 8 is below K6 n requires three layers for n 8 For K6 7 we don t know whether two or three layers are needed Hypercubes Below we show a two layer drawing of a six dimensional hypercube More generally the d cube has geometric thickness at most ceiling d 3 Eppstein GD 2 4 Minor Closed Graph Families Blankenship and Oporowski 2 1 2 3 showed that all proper minor closed graph families have bounded book thickness Therefore they also have bounded geometric thickness Low Degree Graphs Graphs with maximum degree up to four require geometric thickness at most two Duncan et al SCG 2 4 How does the geometric thickness behave for bounded degree graphs with higher degree bounds Some progress has been made by Dujmovi et al GD 2 4 who showed that the geometric thickness is O 1 for bounded degree interval graphs co comparability graphs and AT free graphs and that it is O log n for bounded degree bounded treewidth graphs Duncan CCCG 2 9 showed that the geometric treewidth is also O log n for graphs that can be decomposed into the union of two bounded treewidth graphs without degree restrictions However Bar t Matou ek and Wood math CO 5 915 have shown that larger constant bounds on degree need not imply bounded thickness for arbitrary graphs In particular they use counting arguments to prove the existence of regular graphs for any 8 with geometric thickness nc for some c where c depends on and approachs 1 2 in the limit of large Computational complexity For arbitrary graphs testing whether the graph has thickness k is NP complete even for k 2 Mansfield MPCPS 1983 Testing the geometric thickness of a particular drawing is polynomial time for thickness two but NP complete for higher thickness Eppstein SODA 2 4 Recognizing whether a graph has geometric thickness two is also NP complete as is coloring graphs of geometric thickness t with 4t 1 colors Durocher WG 2 13 Open Problems The complete graphs Kn should require a number of layers of the form c n for some constant c What is c Similarly what is the asymptotic number of layers needed for Kn n If a multi layer drawing of a graph is made in which all the vertices have integer coordinates how big do those integers need to be For planar graphs it is known that all coordinates can be O n How large can the ratio between thickness and book thickness of a graph be as a function of the number of vertices in the graph Similarly how large can the ratio between geometric thickness and thickness be The examples of Bar t Matou ek and Wood math CO 5 915 show that this ratio can at least approach sqrt n What happens if we allow restricted types of curves other than straight line segments For instance Wood ENDM 2 1 has looked at thickness for curves with one bend that are allowed to change layers at the bend What if the curves can bend in a restricted way but can t change layers Hutchinson et al proved that the number of edges of a n vertex graph with geometric thickness two is at most 6n 18 However the largest number of edges that is known for an example of such a graph is 6n 19 for all n at least 9 by Durocher et al Which of these two is the correct bound Determining the chromatic number of thickness two graphs is Ringel s famous Earth Moon problem What about the chromatic number of graphs with low geometric thickness The best lower bound for Ringel s problem comes from the graph K6 C5 which has thickness two and requires nine colors however this graph has 5 edges violating a 6n 18 upper bound on the number of edges of a geometric thickness two graph due to Hutchinson et al Is there a different nine chromatic graph with geometric thickness two References J Bar t J Matou ek and D R Wood Bounded degree graphs have arbitrarily

The minimum number of layers in a drawing, if you allow curved\nedges, is a well studied concept known as the <i>thickness</i> of the\ngraph. The minimum number of layers in a drawing with straight edges is\na less well studied concept which we call the <i>geometric\nthickness.</i></p>\n\n<h2>Complete Graphs</h2>\n\n<p>The following drawing shows that the geometric thickness of the\ncomplete graph on twelve vertices (K<sub>12</sub>) is at most\nthree:</p>\n\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><img src=\"K12.png\" width=\"514\" height=\"434\"\nalt=\"Three-layer drawing of K_{12}\"><br>\n</div>\n\n<p>The central hexagon of this drawing is a little hard to see, so\nhere is a closer view:</p>\n\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><img src=\"K12ctr.png\" width=\"432\" height=\"350\"\nalt=\"Close-up drawing of K_{12}\"><br>\n</div>\n\n<p>The pattern used for this drawing can be generalized to show that,\nfor any n, the graph K<sub>n</sub> can be drawn in at most ceiling(n/4)\nlayers [Eppstein et al, JGAA 2000].

When a is much smaller than b, the geometric thickness of\nK<sub>a,b</sub> is just a/2, but complete bipartite graphs in which both\nsides are of nearly equal size are more interesting.

How does the geometric\nthickness behave for bounded degree graphs with higher degree bounds?\nSome progress has been made by [Dujmovi&#263; et al., GD 2004] who\nshowed that the geometric thickness is O(1) for bounded-degree interval\ngraphs, co-comparability graphs, and AT-free graphs, and that it is\nO(log&nbsp;n) for bounded-degree bounded-treewidth graphs. Duncan [CCCG\n2009] showed that the geometric treewidth is also O(log&nbsp;n) for\ngraphs that can be decomposed into the union of two bounded-treewidth\ngraphs, without degree restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>However, Bar&aacute;t, Matou&#353;ek, and Wood [math.CO/0509150]\nhave shown that larger constant bounds on degree need not imply bounded\nthickness for arbitrary graphs.  In particular, they use counting\narguments to prove the existence of\n&Delta;-regular graphs for any &Delta;&nbsp;>&nbsp;8 with geometric thickness\n&Omega;(n<sup>c</sup>) for some c&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, where c depends on\n&Delta; and approachs 1/2\nin the limit of large &Delta;.</p>\n\n<h2>Computational complexity</h2>\n\nFor arbitrary graphs, testing whether the graph has thickness k is\nNP-complete, even for k=2 [Mansfield, MPCPS 1983].  Testing the\ngeometric thickness of a particular drawing is polynomial time for\nthickness two but NP-complete for higher thickness [Eppstein, SODA\n2004]. Recognizing whether a graph has geometric thickness two is also\nNP-complete, as is coloring graphs of geometric thickness <i>t</i>\nwith 4<i>t</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 colors [Durocher, WG 2013].\n\n\n<h2>Open Problems</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The complete graphs K<sub>n</sub> should require a number of\nlayers of the form c*n, for some constant c. What is c?</li>\n\n<li>Similarly, what is the asymptotic number of layers needed for\nK<sub>n,n</sub>?</li>\n\n<li>If a multi-layer drawing of a graph is made in which all the\nvertices have integer coordinates, how big do those integers need\nto be? (For planar graphs, it is known that all coordinates can be\nO(n).)</li>\n\n<li>How large can the ratio between thickness and book thickness of a graph be,\nas a function of the number of vertices in the graph?\nSimilarly how large can the ratio between geometric thickness and\nthickness be?\nThe examples of Bar&aacute;t, Matou&#353;ek, and Wood [math.CO/0509150]\nshow that this ratio can at least approach sqrt&nbsp;n.</li>\n\n<li>What happens if we allow restricted types of curves other than\nstraight line segments?  For instance, Wood [ENDM 2001] has looked at\nthickness for curves with one bend that are allowed to change layers at\nthe bend. What if the curves can bend in a restricted way but can't\nchange layers?\n\n<li>Hutchinson et al. proved that the number of edges of a <i>n</i>-vertex\ngraph with geometric thickness two is at most\n6<i>n</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;18.\nHowever, the largest number of edges that is known for an example of\nsuch a graph is\n6<i>n</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;19 (for all <i>n</i> at least 9, by Durocher\net al.)
