{"text": "2 Systems of Linear Equations Due Wed Oct 3 2 1 Introduction No doubt you have encountered linear equations many times during your careers as students Most likely the very first equation you had to solve was linear Yet despite their simplicity systems of linear equations are of immense importance in mathematics and its applications to areas of physical sciences economics engineering and many many more One of the purposes of linear algebra is to undertake a systematic study of linear equations In this lab we will use MATLAB to solve systems of linear equations We will also learn about a very useful application of systems of linear equations to economics and computer science 2 2 Systems of Linear Equations By now we have seen how a system of linear equations can be transformed into a matrix equation making the system easier to solve For example the system can be written the following way Now by augmenting the matrix with the vector on the right and using row operations this equation can easily be solved by hand However if our system did not have nice integer entries solving the system by hand using row reduction could become very difficult MATLAB provides us with an easier way to get an answer A system of this type has the form Ax b so we can enter these numbers into MATLAB using the following commands A 2 1 1 1 2 3 3 1 b 8 9 3 Notice that for the column vector b we include semicolons after each entry to ensure that the entries are on different rows the command b 8 9 3 would produce a row vector which is not the same thing The command x A b will find the solution if it exists to our equation Ax b In this case MATLAB tells us x 2 1 3 Remark 2 1 Please take care in entering A b command It has a backslash and NOT a forward slash Exercise 2 1 a Consider the system of equations 2x1 x2 5x3 1 x1 6x3 2 6x1 2x2 4x3 3 On paper convert this system of equations into a matrix equation of the form Cx d b Enter the matrix C and the column vector d into MATLAB and use the command x C d to check your solution c We would expect to get the column vector d in MATLAB if we ran the command C x right In other words C x d should be zero Enter this equation into MATLAB C x d What do you get Remark 2 2 The discrepancy in part c of the above exercise is simply due to rounding error You ll notice that the error is a vector multiplied by a very small number one on the order of 1 15 But why is there any error at all After all solving by row reduction gave very nice numbers right The reason lies in the way MATLAB stores numbers In this calculation MATLAB represents numbers in floating point form which means it represents them in scientifc notation to 1 14 accuracy Thus when you see 1 14 printed in calculations it is equivalent to zero There is a drawback however to solving systems of equations using the command x C d Let us explore that further Exercise 2 2 Consider the following system of equations 1 x1 4x2 15x1 6x2 As you did in the previous exercise enter the corresponding matrix C and the column vector d into MATLAB Then type in x C d Note the strange output Include it in your write up Now go ahead and solve this system by hand How many free variables do you need to write down the solution Based on your answer can you explain why you got the error message when trying to use x C d command To deal with the case of inconsistent systems or systems with infinitely many solutions it may sometimes be better to use MATLAB to simply row reduce your matrix and then read off the solutions We happen to be very lucky since MATLAB has a command that performs Gaussian elimination for you Consider the following homogeneous system of equations 6x1 2x2 3x3 4x1 x2 2x3 2x1 x2 5x3 Enter the corresponding matrix C and the column vector d into MATLAB Now we want to perform row reduction on the augmented matrix C d The command that performs row reduction in MATLAB is called rref it stands for reduced row echelon form Then type in rref C d ans 1 3 5 1 12 Recall from class that we can then use the row reduced form to get that x1 3 5x3 x2 12x3 x3 here is the free variable and it can be choosen to be any value Once chosen the two equations above determine the values of x1 and x2 For instance if we choose x3 2 then x1 7 and x2 24 In this way we can write down all the solutions of which there are infinitely many to the system above Exercise 2 3 a Consider the following homogeneous system of equations x1 3x2 2x3 2x1 6x2 4x3 4x1 12x2 8x3 By using the rref command write down the general solution to this system of equations How many free variables are required Next we turn to some applications of linear algebra which will involve word problems Often in a linear algebra course such problems are assigned from the textbook and are to be done using pencil and paper This can be quite tedious Hopefully with your burgeoning MATLAB expertise you will be able to see that the mathematical models we will explore in this course work even for systems with hundreds of variables 2 3 An Application to Economics Leontief Models Wassily Leontief 19 6 1999 was a Russian born American economist who aside from developing highly sophisticated economic theories also enjoyed trout fishing ballet and fine wines He won the 1973 Nobel Prize in economics for his work in creating mathematical models to describe various economic phenomena In the remainder of this lab we will look at a very simple special case of his work called a closed exchange model Here is the premise Suppose in a far away land of Eigenbazistan in a small country town called Matrixville there lived a Farmer a Tailor a Carpenter a Coal Miner and Slacker Bob The Farmer produced food the Tailor clothes the Carpenter housing the Coal Miner supplied energy and Slacker Bob made High Quality 1 Proof Moonshine half of which he drank himself Let us make the following assumptions Everyone buys from and sells to the central pool i e there is no outside supply and demand Everything produced is consumed For these reasons this is called a closed exchange model Next we must specify what fraction of each of the goods is consumed by each person in our town Here is a table containing this information FoodClothesHousingEnergyHigh Quality 1 Proof MoonshineFarmer 25 15 25 18 2 Tailor 15 28 18 17 5Carpenter 22 19 22 22 1 Coal Miner 2 15 2 28 15Slacker Bob 18 23 15 15 5 So for example the Carpenter consumes 22 of all food 19 of all clothes 22 of all housing 22 of all energy and 1 of all High Quality 1 Proof Moonshine Exercise 2 4 Note that the columns in this table all add up to 1 Explain why this happens Now let pF pT pC pCM pSB denote the incomes of the Farmer Tailor Carpenter Coal Miner and Slacker Bob respectively Note that each of these quantities not only denotes the incomes of each of our esteemed citizens but also the cost of the corresponding goods So for example pF is the Farmer s income as well as the cost of all the food So if the Farmer produces 1 worth of food then his income will also be 1 since all of this food is bought out and the profits go to the Farmer The idea is of course to be able to figure out how should we price the goods in order for the citizens of Matrixville to survive i e we must find pF pT pC pCM and pSB subject to the following conditions 25pF 15pT 25pC 18pCM 2 pSB pF 15pF 28pT 18pC 17pCM 5pSB pT 22pF 19pT 22pC 22pCM 1 pSB pC 2 pF 15pT 2 pC 28pCM 15pSB pCM 18pF 23pT 15pC 15pCM 5 pSB pSB Exercise 2 5 Explain where this system of equations came from and what it means Think about what the left hand side and the right hand side of each equation mean Let us denote the column vector pF pT pC pCM pSB T by p and let C be the coefficient matrix of the above system We can now rewrite that system as Cp p or equivalently Cp p Cp Ip C I p where I is the 5x5 matrix with 1 s on the diagonal and s everywhere else The property of the matrix I we are using is that Iv v for any vector v Exercise 2 6 a Enter the matrices C and I into MATLAB C 25 15 25 18 2 15 28 18 17 5 22 19 22 22 1 2 15 2 28 15 18 23 15 15 5 I eye 5 Note that the command eye n creates an n x n matrix with 1 s on the diagonal and s elsewhere b Use MATLAB to row reduce the augmented matrix C I p and write down the general solution to C I p c What are the highest and the lowest priced commodities in Matrixville List the inhabitants of this charming town in order of increasing income If our friend Bob makes 4 per year what are the incomes for the rest of the inhabitants With all the moonshine that Bob drinks do you think he will live long enough to enjoy his good life 2 4 How Google Works The beginning of this story is actually a theorem of Perron Frobenius from the early 2 th century but we will discuss this later in our tale Instead we start with a cute word problem illustrating the theorem which has amused linear algebra students at least as far back as the 197 s The problem is In a particular group of people who is the most popular One possible approach is to ask everyone in the group to list their friends in that group Say there are 4 people named Jane Charlie Mary and Fred who we affectionately nickname J C M and F The friends list is Jane lists C and M Charlie lists J M and F Mary lists J C and F Fred lists J and M This experiment is dangerous You should not try it in your own dormitory Our data naturally amounts to a 4x4 matrix of s and 1 s Some people tend to list every one they ever met and others only list closest friends so to compensate for this we normalize the matrix by dividing each list by the number of people in it We shall call this the linking matrix and denote it by L Now that we have collected data we wish to determine a nonnegative number associated to each person called their popularity combined they give the popularity vector for the group Its basic property is A person s popularity is the weighted sum of the popularity of people who reference that person We see what the weights are and what this means by the example which seems reasonable when one considers that Charlie s contribution to Jane s popularity is 1 3 rCharlie because Jane constitutes one third of Charlie s friends and rCharlie is Charlie s popularity In matrix vector form these equations are exactly Lr r Equation A 1 which is the same as L I r where I is the 4x4 identity matrix Solving this equation we can determine the relative popularity of Jane Charlie Mary an Fred We ran MATLAB using the rref command as in exercise 2 6 and set arbitrarily of course rF 1 to get rJ 1 5 rC 1 3125 rM 1 6875 and rF 1 Thus the order of popularity from highest to lowest is Mary Jane Charlie and finally Fred Some graduate students at Stanford got the idea that this sort of method could be used to rank a group of web pages You type in some key words which we will denote by the set K and the software identifies vast numbers of webpages WK most of which are garbage as far as you are concerned containing the words in K The big challenge is automatically finding a few good popular webpages What the Google founders did was have the software look at each webpage w in WK and determine which other web pages in WK the page w links to thus associating to each webpage w a vector Lw of s and 1 s just as we did above with the list of students Next it builds a matrix L whose columns are the normalized vectors Lw and proceeds just as we did in the popularity problem Google computes r very quickly and lists for you the user the web pages in order of high to low popularity Sounds like a good plan but if you are going to base a company on this and put up lots of money to back it there are few things you would definitely want to know a Does the equation Lr r above always have a solution what do you know from the course so far makes you think it seldom will b Will a solution have entries that are nonnegative c Is the solution unique If not we will have conflicting rankings Fortunately the founders of Google knew Theorem Perron Frobenious For any matrix L having all entries nonnegative and each column summing to 1 the equation Lr r has a nonnegative solution r Thus the Perron Frobenius theorem tells us that there always is a solution to the popularity problem While we do not go into it the theory also tells us that uniqueness is usually true and explains the circumstances when it is not In the late 199 s the leading internet portal was Yahoo which employed warehouses full of people to look at web pages and grade them By using this simple math model with a few bells and whistles added Google quickly displaced Yahoo The ranking you just saw is often called the Page Rank after Larry Page a founder of Google who is in a few years became one of the 1 richest Americans All of this is indeed a core example at the heart of a rapidly growing area of analysis of networks There are several morals to draw Theorems are efficient ways to remember key ideas What a mathematician calls a proof may well translate to industry as quality control Lastly if you learn linear algebra well then you will probably get rich Now it s time for a little practice with the PageRank algorithm Suppose that we have five websites namely the sites of your good friends Alan Beth Charlie Dana and Eleanor which we ll simply refer to as A B C D and E Let s also suppose that the links between the various sites are given by the graph below The arrow pointing from C to D means that Charlie s site links to Dana s etc For small collections of objects graphs like this are an effective means of showing the links between sites Exercise 2 7 a Create a linking matrix L which contains the information of which site links to which just as we did in the popularity example Remember to normalize and be sure that your input is exact for example make sure you enter 1 3 instead of 333 this is important for part b since our columns must sum to 1 Include all input and output from Matlab b Use the rref command to find all solutions x to the matrix equation L I x Include all input and output from Matlab If you get something like Empty matrix 5 by be sure to double check your answer to part a c Whose website has the highest PageRank Explain your answer especially in light of any negative numbers which may have arisen in part b List the remaining websites in order of decreasing PageRank In practice L is often huge So a question to mull over is how can we solve Lr r for problems of huge size Working in our favor is the fact that that most entries of L are Such an L is called a sparse matrix and a major branch of mathematics research is exploiting this to find a solution What do we do A hint Gaussian Elimination row reduction will not work Later in these assignments we shall get a glimpse of something that does 2 5 Conclusion Systems of linear equations though quite uncomplicated theoretically show up in many interesting applications Leontief s closed exchange model and Google s Page Rank algorithm are only two of many such applications Because systems of linear equations that arise in applications tend to be quite big and messy and not suitable to working with by hand computer programs such as MATLAB turn out to be an indispensable tool for people who must work with such systems in their work Acknowledgement This lab was developed by faculty and graduate students at UCSD

The problem is: In a particular\ngroup of people,\nwho is the most popular?\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One possible approach is to ask everyone in the\ngroup\nto list their friends in that group.\nSay there are 4 people, named Jane, Charlie, Mary and Fred,\nwho we affectionately nickname J, C, M and F.\nThe friends list is:\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\"> Jane lists C and M<br>\nCharlie lists J, M and F<br>\nMary lists J, C and F<br>\nFred lists J and M\n</p>\n<p>(This experiment is dangerous.

Solving this equation we\ncan\ndetermine the relative\n\"popularity\" of Jane, Charlie, Mary an Fred.\nWe ran MATLAB using the <font color=\"#990000\">rref</font> command as\nin exercise 2.6 and set (arbitrarily, of course) <b>r<sub>F</sub></b>\n= 1 to get <b>r<sub>J</sub></b> = 1.5, <b>r<sub>C</sub></b>\n= 1.3125, <b>r<sub>M</sub></b> = 1.6875, and <b>r<sub>F</sub></b> =\n1. Thus the order of popularity, from highest to lowest, is: Mary,\nJane, Charlie, and finally, Fred.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some graduate students at Stanford got the idea\nthat this\nsort of method could be used to rank a group of web pages. You type in\nsome key words (which we will denote by the set <i>K</i>) and the\nsoftware identifies vast numbers of\nwebpages <i>W<sub>K</sub></i> (most of which are garbage as far as you\nare concerned) containing the words in <i>K.</i>&nbsp;\nThe\nbig\nchallenge\nis automatically finding a few good (popular) webpages.\nWhat the Google founders did was have the software look at each webpage\n<i>w</i> in <i>W<sub>K</sub></i> and determine which other web\npages in <i>W<sub>K</sub></i> the page <i>w</i> links to, thus\nassociating to each webpage <i>w</i> a vector <i>L<sub>w</sub></i> of\n0's and 1's, just as we did above with the list of students.\nNext, it builds a matrix <i>L</i> whose columns are the normalized\nvectors <i>L<sub>w</sub></i> and proceeds just as we did in the\npopularity problem. Google computes <i>r</i> very quickly and lists\nfor you, the user, the web pages in order of high to low popularity.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds like a good plan, but if you are going to\nbase a company\non this and put up lots of money to back it,\nthere are few things you would definitely want to know:<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Does the equation&nbsp;\nL<b>r</b> = <b>r</b> above always have a solution\n(what do you know from the course so far makes you think\nit seldom will?)<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Will a solution have entries that are\nnonnegative?<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Is the solution unique? If not, we will have\nconflicting rankings.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the founders of Google knew\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Theorem (Perron-Frobenious)</b>\nFor any matrix <i>L</i> having all entries nonnegative\nand each column summing to 1, the equation <i>L<b>r</b> = <b>r</b></i>\nhas a nonnegative solution <b><i>r</i></b>.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us that\nthere always is a solution to the popularity problem. While we do not\ngo into it, the theory also tells us that uniqueness is usually true,\nand explains the circumstances when it is not.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1990s the leading internet portal was\nYahoo, which employed warehouses full of people to look at web pages\nand grade them. By using this simple math model (with a few bells and\nwhistles added) Google quickly displaced Yahoo. The ranking you just\nsaw is often called the Page Rank after Larry Page, a founder of\nGoogle, who is in a few years became one of the 10 richest Americans.\nAll of this is indeed a core example at the heart of a rapidly growing\narea of analysis of networks.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several morals to draw.\nTheorems are efficient ways to remember key ideas.\nWhat a mathematician calls a proof may well translate to\nindustry as quality control. Lastly,\nif you learn linear algebra well, then you will probably get rich.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's time for a little practice with the\nPageRank algorithm. Suppose that we have five websites, namely the\nsites of your good friends Alan, Beth, Charlie, Dana, and Eleanor,\nwhich\nwe'll simply refer to as A, B, C, D, and E. Let's also suppose that the\nlinks between the various sites are given by the graph below:\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img style=\"border: 0px solid ; width: 500px; height: 500px;\" alt=\"\"\n src=\"Lab2Images/GoogleGraph.jpg\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrow pointing from C to D means that\nCharlie's site links to Dana's, etc. For small collections of objects,\ngraphs like this are an effective means of showing the links between\nsites.\n</p>\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n height=\"116\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\" width=\"1137\" height=\"23\"><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Exercise\n2.7</b></font></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n\n      <td ><font color=\"#009900\"><b>(a)</b></font>&nbsp;\nCreate\na\nlinking\nmatrix\nL\nwhich contains the information of which site\nlinks to which just as we did in the popularity example.

Working in our favor is the fact that that most entries\nof <i>L</i> are 0.&nbsp; Such an <i>L</i> is called a sparse matrix,\nand a major\nbranch of mathematics research is exploiting this to\nfind a solution. What do we do?\nA hint: Gaussian Elimination (row reduction) will not work.\nLater in these assignments we shall get a glimpse of\nsomething that does.\n<br>\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\"\n xmlns:o=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\"\n xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40\">\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"en-us\">\n  <meta name=\"GENERATOR\" content=\"Microsoft FrontPage 6.0\">\n  <meta name=\"ProgId\" content=\"FrontPage.Editor.Document\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"\n content=\"text/html; charset=windows-1252\">\n  <title>Introduction to MATLAB</title>\n  <style>\n\n<!--\n\ndiv.Section1\n\n\t{page:Section1;}\n\nspan.GramE\n\n\t{}\n\n-->\n\n  </style>\n</head>\n\n</html>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"4\"><br>\n2.5 Conclusion</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systems\nof linear equations, though quite uncomplicated theoretically, show up\nin many interesting applications.&nbsp; Leontief's closed exchange\nmodel and Google's Page Rank algorithm are only two of many such\napplications.&nbsp; Because systems of\nlinear equations that arise in applications tend to be quite big and\nmessy and not suitable to working with by hand, computer programs, such\nas MATLAB, turn out to be an indispensable tool for people who must\nwork with such systems in their work.</font></p>\n<hr width=\"100%\" size=\"2\">\n<p><i>Acknowledgement: This lab was developed by faculty and graduate students at UCSD.\n(<a href=\"http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math20f/Fall/MatlabIndex.html\">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math20f/Fall/MatlabIndex.html</a>).</i></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 24858.0}
