{"text": "Assignment System Tutorial and Pitch For this assignment you will examine some software system you re familiar with from a variety of perspectives introducing new users to the system and proposing changes to the system Overview Imagine for example that you are in charge of the Gmail for UCI Rollout You will have to instruct new users both students and faculty on how to use Gmail You might write an introductory document explaining the basics of electronic mail and the kinds of operations one might expect to perform creating and sending messages receiving a message printing it saving it and so on later in that document or in another document you might give a tutorial providing the details of carrying out those operations the specific commands to use perhaps with a set of examples the reader would follow You might also give an oral introduction to Gmail to groups of new users In addition you might think that Gmail could be improved in various ways such as a new graphical user interface or additional features Probably you would have to convince someone your boss or a committee in charge of deciding what software enhancements are most important that these changes would be worth implementing You would make your case both in a written memo and in an oral presentation For this assignment you will choose a software project on Sourceforge and do each of these things You are not allowed to select the VLC media player As you develop each of these different documents and their corresponding oral presentations focus on how the audience for each document is different they have different experience different needs and so on which means that how you write for each will be different too Part Audience Formality Pitch Decision makers who know about the software but must be convinced of the need to change and the feasibility and advisability of the changes you propose Correct and professional addressing corporate higher ups Tutorial Novices unfamiliar with the software who need to learn its purpose and basic functionality Friendly yet professional Part 1 Introductory message First you must decide what Sourceforge system you will use for these assignments Select a system that is intricate enough to describe in three four pages double spaced Also make sure you are that you are familiar enough with the system to be able to suggest a modification This proposed change will form the basis for the Pitch assignmnt As listed on the schedule prepare a post to the correct forum on the class bulliten board Make sure your post includes 1 the name of the system 2 a one to two sentence description of the system and 3 a one to two sentence sketch of the proposed change Part 2 Tutorial for novices You will write an introduction to the system for novice users of three to four pages This document should give a high level description of the system and its capabilities describing what tasks the system will perform and giving the necessary background It should not get into the tedious minor details of which keys to press or which menu items to choose We will grade this part of the assignment using the following rubric Part 3 Pitch for business management You will write a proposal for changing this system of five to six pages plus a brief single page cover letter Address this proposal to whatever decision making authority is appropriate for your software perhaps the company that publishes it perhaps an individual or committee in your own organization Your goal should be to produce a proposal you can actually send We will grade this part of the assignment using the following rubric Part 4 Tutorial presentation 4 minutes long For the final oral presentation you will present your Tutorial to a novice audience Part 5 Pitch presentation 1 2 minutes long You will give a short elevator pitch that is targeted to a business management audience Suggestions and advice Reread the instructions for submissions and follow them closely Each part of this assignment shares the same underlying subject matter What s different in each part is the intended audience and thus what knowledge you assume what you cover explicitly and the level of formality Novice users have different needs and a different set of assumptions than decision makers If possible choose software that you know something about and more importantly that you care about The best writing and the easiest for the writer is writing where the writer has experience with the topic and really cares about getting it across to the reader So choose something that matters to you We encourage your effective use of graphics in both the written assignments and presentations though graphics may not reduce your prose page count below the minimum To the extent applicable you should state your sources of information in your written proposal backing up whatever facts and figures you used This need not be gathered all together at the end as a formal bibliography it is better to mention the name of the source at the point where you use its information in the body of the paper If your word processor supports automatic footnotes use them but do not waste time trying to include footnotes manually an in line citation is fine Citations should provide enough detail to allow the reader to find the cited work and follow up on the information and all the citations in a document should follow a consistent format but the precise format you use is not crucial for this assignment There s a big difference between spoken and written language For the oral portions of this assignment do not simply read from a script Of course you will use notes but speak naturally rather than reading a canned speech On the other hand the presentations are relatively formal in tone joking banter and slang are not appropriate You will have an opportunity to give your classmates written feedback on their presentations you will receive some credit towards class participation for each presentation you comment on We will be happy to advise you on any aspect of your proposal We re a valuable resource take advantage of our assistance ", "_id":

and Pitch </h1>\n\n<p> For this assignment, you will examine some software system you're familiar with from a variety of perspectives: introducing new users to the system and proposing changes to the system.\n\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p> Imagine, for example, that you are in charge of the \n<a href=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/googleapps/rollout.html\">Gmail for UCI</a> Rollout. You will have to instruct new users, both students and faculty, on how to use Gmail. You might write an introductory document, explaining the basics of electronic mail and the kinds of operations one might expect to perform (creating and sending messages,  receiving a message, printing it, saving it, and so on); later in that document, or in another document, you might give a tutorial providing the details of carrying out those operations (the specific commands to use), perhaps with a set of examples the reader would follow.  You might also give an oral introduction to \"Gmail\" to groups of new users.\n\n<p> In addition, you might think that \"Gmail\" could be improved in various ways (such as a new graphical user interface or additional features).  Probably you would have to convince someone (your boss, or a committee in charge of deciding what software enhancements are most important) that these changes would be worth implementing.  You would make your case both in a written memo and in an oral presentation.\n\n<p> For this assignment, you will choose a software project on <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/\"> Sourceforge <a/> and do each of these things. You are <b>not</b> allowed to select the VLC media player.  As\nyou develop each of these different documents (and their corresponding oral presentations), focus on how the audience for each document is different - they have different experience, different needs, and so on, which means that how you write for each will be different, too.\n\n<p>\n\n<table border=1 width=1000>\n<tr class=\"head\">\n<td width=200> Part\n<td width=400> Audience\n<td width=350> Formality\n\n<tr> \n<td> Pitch\n<td> Decision makers, who know about the software but must be convinced of the need to change (and the feasibility and advisability of the changes you propose)\n<td> Correct and professional, addressing corporate\nhigher-ups\n\n<tr>\n<td> Tutorial\n<td> Novices, unfamiliar with the software, who need to learn its purpose and basic functionality.\n<td> Friendly yet professional\n\n</table>\n\n\n<h3> Part 1: Introductory message </h3>\n<p> First, you must decide what Sourceforge system you will use for these assignments. Select a system that is intricate enough to describe in three-four pages (double-spaced). Also make sure you are that you are familiar enough with the system to be able to suggest a modification. This proposed change will form the basis for the Pitch assignmnt. As listed on the <a href=\"schedule.html\">schedule</a>, prepare a post to the correct forum on the class bulliten board. Make sure your post includes (1) the name of the system, (2) a one to two sentence description of the system, and (3) a one to two sentence sketch of the proposed change.\n\n<h3> Part 2: Tutorial (for novices)</h3>\n<p> You will write an introduction to the system for novice users, of <em>three to four pages</em>.  This document should give a high-level description of the system and its capabilities, describing what tasks the system will perform and giving the necessary background. It should not get into the tedious minor details of which keys to press or which menu items to choose.

What's different in each part is the intended audience (and thus what knowledge you assume, what you cover explicitly, and the level of formality). Novice users have different needs and a different set of assumptions than decision-makers,\n\n<p> If possible, choose software that you know something about, and more importantly, that you care about.
