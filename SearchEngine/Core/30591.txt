Regarding other\r\nLangsams in Israel, interestingly enough the head of Yad Vashem, Avner\r\nShalev, is really a Langsam. You will note that Shalev is the Hebraicized\r\ntranslation of the name Langsam. I don't think, however, that he is into\r\nthe family tree thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nDov Rubin\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: Irena.steinfeldt@yadvashem.org.il\r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com\r\nDate: Sun, 3 Feb 2002 11:34:29 +0200 \r\n\r\nGood morning,\r\nAs promised, I talked to Avner Shalev about your web site. He is very\r\ninterested in your work, but says that due to his heavy workload at Yad\r\nVashem, he neglected dealing with his own family history. He will do his\r\nbest to find some time to answer you in detail. Meanwhile he wishes you all\r\nthe best and congratulates you on the work you have done so far. \r\nBest regards, \r\nIrena Steinfeldt\r\nExecutive Assistant to the Chairman of the Yad Vashem Directorate\r\ntel: 972-2-6443636\r\nfax: 972-2-6443452\r\nemail: irena.steinfeldt@yadvashem.org.il\r\nwww.yadvashem.org\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nDate: Thu, 04 Dec 2003 20:11:52 -0500 \r\nTo: Alexander.Avraham@yadvashem.org.il \r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com> \r\nCc: solly.kaplinski@yadveshem.org.il, \r\n\r\nDear Director, \r\n\r\nThank you for your warm words and kind support. Perhaps you can\r\nassist me in a somewhat selfish request. Dr. Avner Shalav is a\r\nLANGSAM descendant, that was his family name. I have contacted \r\nhim and his secretary (Irena Steinfeldt) countless times, but can\r\nnot seem to get any information. Does Dr. Shalav have any siblings\r\nor relatives I can speak to instead? I do not need to find this out\r\nfrom him. Like Yad >Vashem, I have the desire to perpetuate my\r\nfamily, especially those that perished in the Holocaust. I can not\r\nunderstand why someone in his position would not share a similar\r\nattitude. As someone devoted to commemorating our heritage, perhaps\r\nyou can prevail upon him to answer three short questions: \r\n  * father's name \r\n  * his grandfather's name \r\n  * what city his grandfather was from  \r\n\r\nThanks again, \r\nMoishe Miller \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAt 05:59 PM 1/8/04 +0200, solly.kaplinski@yadvashem.org.il wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Moshe, \r\n\r\nAt last!
