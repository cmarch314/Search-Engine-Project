The PhD in Informatics prepares students to apply a variety of technical and social approaches to understand fundamental human and digital experiences and to design transformative solutions to a variety of human organizational and social challenges A fundamental focus of our research is a dual view of information technology as a technical object and as a cultural object From a technical perspective we are concerned with the design and analysis of advanced information technologies and digital media But we understand these too as objects that embody social values shape human experiences and carry cultural meaning Our interests lie in the relationship between these two aspects of interactive technology The PhD in Informatics incorporates four connected emphases an empirical focus that emphasizes understanding of technology design and use in practice a theoretical focus aimed at understanding contexts of information system use a technological focus aimed at new capabilities and infrastructures and a design focus that includes integrative and holistic consideration of technical and human considerations Students in the PhD program engage with multiple stakeholders including faculty and researchers in other disciplines major corporations and entrepreneurial enterprises governmental and non governmental agencies and volunteer organizations such as open source communities Through our involvement with these organizations our research connects to the world beyond the university Admission to Graduate Programs in Informatics Students applying to the program may have degrees in any field though preference will generally be given to those with a technical or social science background Doctor of Philosophy in Informatics All PhD students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 3 5 throughout the program In addition no grade lower than B is counted towards satisfying any course requirements Pre Candidacy Course Requirements Required Core Courses INF 261 Social Analysis of Computing INF 232 Research in Human Computer Interaction INF 2 9S Seminar in Informatics twice usually in first year Research Methods Core INF 2 1 Research Methods INF 2 3 Qualitative Methods INF 2 5 Quantitative Methods INF 2 7S Doctoral Seminar on Research and Writing twice usually after first year Research Experience INF 299 Independent Study Four quarters required pre advancement recommended at least two quarters per year in each of the first two years Electives in Informatics 6 Ph D level classes A set of six elective courses The selection of courses should form a coherent educational plan to be approved by the student s faculty advisor and by the Informatics PhD program director A written record of this plan and its approval must be filed with the PhD program director prior to advancement Although the courses may be chosen from any PhD level courses on campus it is recommended that at least three be chosen from within the school of ICS Teaching Requirements To enhance their education and experience in teaching all students will be required to work as readers or TAs for at least two quarters Additionally before or during the first quarter in which they are working in this capacity all students will enroll in ICS 398A a two unit seminar Those students wishing to gain more instruction around their teaching may also enroll in ICS 398B the advanced teaching seminar which is also a two unit seminar Field Examinations There will be no formal field evaluations However each year students will be evaluated individually and given written feedback about their progress for first year students this evaluation will take place before the end of Spring quarter for continuing students it will take place before the end of Fall quarter In preparation students will write a statement about their progress and meet with their advisors who give some feedback and complete a form reporting their assessment of the student s progress The program faculty as a whole will then meet to discuss all the students with a letter written to the student summarizing the assessment and if necessary deadlines for specific activities to be finished or goals to be achieved This evaluation letter will state either that the student is making good progress or has been given cautionary status The students who have certain activities to finish will be reviewed again 6 months after this evaluation A second cautionary review constitutes formal failure to make adequate progress within the program Qualifying Exams At the end of the student s second year The student develops an appropriate reading list to fit his her areas of interest within Informatics co developed with the advisor The student then writes a paper synthesizing this literature and noting the areas that are currently interesting and under researched The paper serves as the basis for an oral examination generally in the Spring quarter of the second year At the end of the third year The student will be evaluated by an assessment of a research portfolio A portfolio should comprise three papers of publishable quality as judged by the faculty These papers might well be expansions or developments from term papers developed in class the goal is to determine the student s capacity to produce research writing of publishable quality Student may work on papers collaboratively but the portfolio as a whole must demonstrate writing ability through single authored or lead authored work Collaboratively written papers will be accompanied by a statement of contributions signed by all authors The students are encouraged to report on projects conducted with at least two different faculty members Advancement to candidacy is on the basis of an oral defense of the research portfolio normally in the Spring of the third year The advancement committee is formed in accordance with UCI campus regulations Doctoral Dissertation Students are required to complete a doctoral dissertation in accordance with Academic Senate regulations In addition they must pass an oral dissertation defense that consists of a public presentation of the student s research followed by an oral examination by the student s doctoral committee The dissertation must be approved unanimously by the committee Final Examination The dissertation defense committee is formed in accordance to UCI Senate regulations This committee must approve the following for the student to pass the final examination Dissertation topic The student must present a substantial written document representing the student s dissertation plan This document must include the proposed dissertation abstract a dissertation outline a comprehensive survey of related work and a detailed plan for completing the work The student must present this dissertation plan to the dissertation committee who must unanimously approve the student s proposal Dissertation document The student must prepare the written dissertation in accordance with Academic Senate regulations and present this document to the committee with enough advance notice for appropriate review and critique prior to an oral defense Following an oral defense of this document any changes required must be approved by the entire committee Oral defense The student must pass an oral dissertation defense that consists of a public presentation of the student s research followed by an oral examination by the student s doctoral committee To ensure the public has an opportunity to participate in this examination the student must announce the defense title date and time at least two weeks prior to the event to all faculty and doctoral students in the department Normative Time from Matriculation to Degree Students making normal progress are expected to complete their coursework and produce 2 3 research papers of publishable quality in three years The dissertation proposal is expected midway through the fourth year with completion in the fifth More Graduate Prospective studentsPrograms of study M S degree overviewPh D degree overview Academic year planFormsPoliciesFunding housingComputing supportCampus resourcesVisit

A fundamental focus of our research is a dual view of information technology -- as a technical object and as a cultural object. From a technical perspective, we are concerned with the design and analysis of advanced information technologies and digital media. But we understand these too as objects that embody social values, shape human experiences, and carry cultural meaning. Our interests lie in the relationship between these two aspects of interactive technology.\n<p>\nThe PhD in Informatics incorporates four connected emphases: an empirical focus that emphasizes understanding of technology design and use in practice; a theoretical focus aimed at understanding contexts of information system use; a technological focus aimed at new capabilities and infrastructures; and a design focus that includes integrative and holistic consideration of technical and human considerations. Students in the PhD program engage with multiple stakeholders, including faculty and researchers in other disciplines, major corporations and entrepreneurial enterprises, governmental and non-governmental agencies, and volunteer organizations such as open source communities. Through our involvement with these organizations, our research connects to the world beyond the university. \n</p>\n<h3>Admission to Graduate Programs in Informatics</h3>\n<p>\nStudents applying to the program may have degrees in any field, though preference will generally be given to those with a technical or social science background.\n</p>\n<h3>Doctor of Philosophy in Informatics</h3>\n<p>\nAll PhD students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5 throughout the program. In addition, no grade lower than B is counted towards satisfying any course requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b><i>Pre-Candidacy Course Requirements</i></b> <br/>\n<i>Required Core Courses</i> <br/>\nINF 261: Social Analysis of Computing <br/>\nINF 232: Research in Human Computer Interaction <br/>\nINF 209S: Seminar in Informatics (twice, usually in first year) </p>\n<p>\n<i>Research Methods Core</i> <br/>\nINF 201: Research Methods <br/>\nINF 203: Qualitative Methods <br/>\nINF 205: Quantitative Methods <br/>\nINF 207S: Doctoral Seminar on Research and Writing (twice, usually after first year) </p>\n<p><i><i>\n<i>Research Experience</i>\nINF 299 (Independent Study): Four quarters required pre-advancement, recommended at least two quarters per year in each of the first two years.  <br/>\n</i></i></p>\n<p><i><i>\n<i>Electives in Informatics  (6 Ph.D. level classes)</i> <br/></i></i>\nA set of six elective courses. The selection of courses should form a coherent educational plan to be approved by the student&#8217;s faculty advisor and by the Informatics PhD program director. A written record of this plan and its approval must be filed with the PhD program director prior to advancement. Although the courses may be chosen from any PhD level courses on campus, it is recommended that at least three be chosen from within the school of ICS.\n</p>\n<h3>Teaching Requirements</h3>\n<p>\nTo enhance their education and experience in teaching, all students will be required to work as readers or TAs for at least two quarters. Additionally, before or during the first quarter in which they are working in this capacity, all students will enroll in ICS 398A, a two-unit seminar. Those students wishing to gain more instruction around their teaching may also enroll in ICS 398B, the advanced teaching seminar, which is also a two-unit seminar.\n</p>\n<h3>Field Examinations</h3>\n<p>\nThere will be no formal field evaluations. However, each year, students will be evaluated individually and given written feedback about their progress (for first year students, this evaluation will take place before the end of Spring quarter; for continuing students, it will take place before the end of Fall quarter.)  In preparation, students will write a statement about their progress and meet with their advisors who give some feedback and complete a form reporting their assessment of the student&#8217;s progress. The program faculty as a whole will then meet to discuss all the students, with a letter written to the student summarizing the assessment and, if necessary, deadlines for specific activities to be finished or goals to be achieved. This evaluation letter will state either that the student is making good progress or has been given cautionary status. The students who have certain activities to finish will be reviewed again 6 months after this evaluation.  A second cautionary review constitutes formal failure to make adequate progress within the program.\n</p>\n<h3>Qualifying Exams</h3>\n<i>At the end of the student&#8217;s second year:</i> The student develops an appropriate reading list to fit his/her areas of interest within Informatics, co-developed with the advisor.  The student then writes a paper synthesizing this literature and noting the areas that are currently interesting and under-researched. The paper serves as the basis for an oral examination, generally in the Spring quarter of the second year.\n<p>\n<i>At the end of the third year: </i> \nThe student will be evaluated by an assessment of a research portfolio.  A portfolio should comprise three papers of publishable quality, as judged by the faculty.  These papers might well be expansions or developments from term papers developed in class; the goal is to determine the student&#8217;s capacity to produce research writing of publishable quality. Student may work on papers collaboratively, but the portfolio as a whole must demonstrate writing ability through single-authored or lead-authored work.  (Collaboratively written papers will be accompanied by a statement of contributions signed by all authors.)</p>\n<p>The students are encouraged to report on projects conducted with at least two different faculty members.  Advancement to candidacy is on the basis of an oral defense of the research portfolio, normally in the Spring of the third year. The advancement committee is formed in accordance with UCI campus regulations.\n</p>\n<h3>Doctoral Dissertation</h3>\n<p>\nStudents are required to complete a doctoral dissertation in accordance with Academic Senate regulations.  In addition, they must pass an oral dissertation defense that consists of a public presentation of the student&#8217;s research followed by an oral examination by the student&#8217;s doctoral committee. The dissertation must be approved unanimously by the committee.  \n</p>\n<h3>Final Examination</h3>\n<p>\nThe dissertation defense committee is formed in accordance to UCI Senate regulations. This committee must approve the following for the student to pass the final examination:\n</p>\n<p>\nDissertation topic: The student must present a substantial written document representing the student&#8217;s dissertation plan.  This document must include the proposed dissertation abstract, a dissertation outline, a comprehensive survey of related work, and a detailed plan for completing the work.  The student must present this dissertation plan to the dissertation committee, who must unanimously approve the student&#8217;s proposal. \n</p>\n<p>\nDissertation document: The student must prepare the written dissertation in accordance with Academic Senate regulations and present this document to the committee with enough advance notice for appropriate review and critique prior to an oral defense. Following an oral defense of this document, any changes required must be approved by the entire committee.\n</p>\n<p>\nOral defense: The student must pass an oral dissertation defense that consists of a public presentation of the student&#8217;s research followed by an oral examination by the student&#8217;s doctoral committee. To ensure the public has an opportunity to participate in this examination, the student must announce the defense title, date, and time at least two weeks prior to the event to all faculty and doctoral students in the department.  \n</p>\n<h3>Normative Time from Matriculation to Degree</h3>\n<p>\nStudents making normal progress are expected to complete their coursework and produce 2-3 research papers of publishable quality in three years.  The dissertation proposal is expected midway through the fourth year, with completion in the fifth.</p>\n<i><i>\n</i></i>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"><div id=\"sidebar_title\">More Graduate &#187;</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../admissions/index.php\">Prospective students</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"index.php\">Programs of study</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"degrees_MSOverview.php\">M.S. degree overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"degrees_PhDOverview.php\">Ph.D. degree overview</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"../courses/index.php\">Academic year plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../forms/index.php\">Forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../policies/index.php\">Policies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../funding/index.php\">Funding &amp; housing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../computing/account/new.php\">Computing support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../resources.php\">Campus resources</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../about/visit/index.php\">Visit the Bren School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../bin/pdf/grad/Graduate Student Handbook F14-15.pdf\">Graduate Student Handbook</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a> |\n   \n   <!-- <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/sitemap.php\">Site Map</a> | -->\n \n  <a href=\"mailto: i%63%73%77%65%62m%61s%74%65r@%69c%73%2e%75c%69%2eedu\">icswebmaster</a></div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 7375.0}
