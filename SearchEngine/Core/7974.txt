The URSA system relies on the new \r\n\tproactive RSA signature scheme, which allows members in an ad hoc group to make \r\n\taccess control decisions in a distributed manner. The proposed proactive RSA \r\n\tsignature scheme is assumed secure as long as no more than an allowed threshold \r\n\tof participating members is simultaneously corrupted at any point in the \r\n\tlifetime of the scheme.\r\n</P>\r\n<P>In this paper we show an attack on this proposed proactive RSA scheme, in which \r\n\tan admissible threshold of malicious group members can completely recover the \r\n\tgroup RSA secret key in the course of the lifetime of this scheme. Our attack \r\n\tstems from the fact that the threshold signature protocol which is a part of \r\n\tthis proactive RSA scheme leaks some seemingly innocuous information about the \r\n\tsecret signature key. We show how the corrupted members can influence the \r\n\texecution of the scheme in such a way so that the slowly leaked information is \r\n\tused to reconstruct the entire shared secret.\r\n</P>\r\n", "id": 7974.0}
