Address Department of Information and Computer Science University of California Irvine Irvine California 92697 3425 Overview and Prerequisite Knowledge From the UCI Catalog Introduction to the concepts methods and current practice of software engineering The study of large scale software production software lifecycle models as an organizing structure principles and techniques appropriate for each stage of production Laboratory work involves a project illustrating these elements Prerequisite ICS 23 with a grade of C or better In addition to the skills and concepts introduced in previous classes students should have these computing skills when they enter the class or learn them independently in the first week of the quarter The use of a text editor Word etc to create documents The use of a drawing package PowerPoint Visio etc to create graphics for these documents The instructional objectives for the course are as follows introduce you to the discipline of software engineering experientially acquaint you with one version of the software lifecycle provide working knowledge of at least one reasonable technique to be applied in each phase of the lifecycle provide particular insight into software architecture design by information hiding and the problems of software analysis and testing Minimum Knowledge and Skills Expected of Students Who Receive Passing Grades Software Life Cycle Mastery Knowing different life cycles and their appropriateness in different situations Knowing basic principles of software engineering such as separation of concerns modularity and abstraction and knowing how they apply throughout the software life cycle Proficiency Understanding tradeoffs and relationships among the various activities in the software life cycle Understand the meaning and use of a set of basic software qualities Requirements Mastery Interviewing a customer to elicit requirements Writing a textual non formal requirements document Proficiency Understand the structure of a requirements document and know the appropriate kinds of information in such a document Architectural Design Mastery Know the differences among interaction patterns of a set of basic architectural styles Understand the difference between architecture and module design Proficiency Choosing an appropriate architectural style for a particular problem Module Design Mastery Using provided exported and required imported interfaces to define module boundaries Identifying and defining modules in a design Identifying and defining abstract data types in a design Proficiency Applying coupling cohesion fan in and fan out Creating USES and COMPRISES diagrams Exposure Creating a design for a nontrivial sizable problem Programming Mastery General rules of programming style and clarity short rehash from earlier classes Proficiency Mapping a module design onto an implementation in source code Exposure Using existing modules and libraries in an implementation Coding under a heavy deadline requiring tradeoffs between code quality and code functionality Testing Proficiency Testing a program for failures Applying white box testing on short pieces of code Applying black box testing on short pieces of code Exposure Understanding the many dimensions of software quality assurance Understanding the inspection and code walk through process

due on Friday November 3 th Exams December 3 FINAL EXAM 4 6 Assignments and Assessment Aggregate grade for the project 45 Midterm 2 Final 35 The project consists of four assignments Their relative weighting as a percentage of your final grade is as follows Assignment Weight Requirements 1 Architecture and module interfaces NOTE that this is now a revised document Use it not the original Note also that the due date is now 11 7 18 Implementation 7 Testing 1 Specific assignments will be placed on the web giving the assignment the required format and specific grading criteria We do not grade on a curve meaning that we will not assert in advance that half of the class will receive grades at or below a C and half above that Grading is done based on mastery of the material as exhibited in the exams and the project If everyone masters the material very well then everyone will get an A On the other hand if no one were to master the material at all adequately then everyone would receive an F NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED unless you have a legible excuse from a physician an extreme family emergency or unless you are willing to accept an extreme penalty with respect to your assignment s grade Teaching Assistant and Readers TA Girish Sunyanarayana Readers Jin Liang Volkan AginlerXiao Zhang Keeping in Touch Check this website regularly This is the definitive location for course information Announcements concerning assignments will be made here The course mailing list will also be used to make announcements provide instructions and so on The course mailing list will be read only from the student s perspective I e the instructor TA and readers can post messages to the list but not students If you ask one of us a question whose answer is relevant to the rest of the class we ll post the appropriate material to the list An important note about email Any email that you send in conjunction with this class must be sent from a UCI account That is if you want any response or action taken then you must use your UCI account to send the email Email from yahoo hotmail juno home or any other non UCI site will be ignored Computing All computing will be done on the department s NT machines You may use another computer to produce the documents you turn in No handwritten assignments allowed All implementation work will be done in Java Please use the computing equipment or instructional purposes only Also watch out on the social subtleties of electronic mail Academic Dishonesty Cheating in ICS 52 will be punished in accordance with University policy and ICS policy Please familiarize yourself with those documents Note that University policy states that faculty have the responsibility of assigning an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty That appropriate grade for this class is an F Cheating is wrong Don t do it Department of Information and Computer Science University of California Irvine CA 92697 3425", "_id":
