Many recent disasters (the\r\nS.E. Asian Tsunamis, the London subway bombings, the Katrina\r\nhurricane, to name a few) have demonstrated that a lot of\r\nvaluable information becomes available in the hours and days\r\nimmediately following the disaster, and such information is indeed\r\nvaluable to disaster managers or even citizens in their response.\r\nIn this paper we describe our work on developing information\r\nportals for disasters in general; we describe many key information\r\nprocessing capabilities and challenges that we consider\r\nimportant in such portals and also describe our approach to\r\ndeveloping such capabilities.\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Categories and Subject Descriptors:</H3>\r\nH.2.8 [<B>Information System</B>]: Database Management\ufffdSpatial databases and GIS\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3>\r\nSpatial Database, Uncertainty Indexing, U-grid, Probability, Disaster portal\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\n<!-- <font color=red> Downloads of the drafts are temporarily disabled.</font><BR>  -->\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/ISI07_dvk.pdf\">ISI07_dvk.pdf</A><BR>\r\nPresentation: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/ISI07_dvk.ppt\">ISI07_dvk.ppt</A><BR>\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?ISI07_dvk\" width=1 height=1>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{ISI07::dvk,\r\n   author    = {Yiming Ma and Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Sharad Mehrotra and Nalini Venkatasubramanian \r\n                and Ram Hariharan and Naveen Ashish and Jay Lickfett},\r\n   title     = {On-Demand Information Portals for Disaster Situations},\r\n   booktitle = {Proc.\\ of IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics\r\n   (IEEE ISI 2007), short paper},\r\n   year      = {2007},\r\n   month     = {May 24--24},\r\n   address   = {New Brunswick, NJ, USA}\r\n}\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n</html>", "id": 4820.0}
