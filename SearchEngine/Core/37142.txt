{"text": "APBS 4 User Guide Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver PreviousNext IntroductionAPBS is a software package for the numerical solution of the Poisson Boltzmann equation PBE one of the most popular continuum models for describing electrostatic interactions between molecular solutes in salty aqueous media Continuum electrostatics plays an important role in several areas of biomolecular simulation including simulation of diffusional processes to determine ligand protein and protein protein binding kinetics implicit solvent molecular dynamics of biomolecules solvation and binding energy calculations to determine ligand protein and protein protein equilibrium binding constants and aid in rational drug design and biomolecular titration studies APBS was designed to efficiently evaluate electrostatic properties for such simulations for a wide range of length scales to enable the investigation of molecules with tens to millions of atoms APBS uses PMG to solve the Poisson Boltzmann equation numerically PMG is developed and maintained by the Holst Research Group at UC San Diego and is designed to solve the nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann equation and similar problems with linear space and time complexity through the use of box methods inexact Newton methods and algebraic multilevel methods More information about PMG may be found at http www fetk org APBS also uses FEtk to solve the Poisson Boltzmann equation numerically FEtk is developed and maintained by the Holst Research Group at UC San Diego and is designed to solve general coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations accurately and efficiently using adaptive multilevel finite element methods inexact Newton methods algebraic multilevel methods More information about FEtk may be found at http
