{"text": "R Lab 2 Assignment Again it may help to review the Introduction to R and RStudio and last week s discussion on troubleshooting and R functions before attempting this lab assignment Instructions This is a pair programming assignment so find a partner to work with at the beginning of discussion You must work with a different partner than the partner you worked with for R Lab 1 You will turn in one lab assignment between the two of you and both of you will receive the same score Use one laptop between the two of you and take turns being the driver and the navigator If there are an odd number of students in discussion or you cannot find a partner see your TA If you do not attend discussion you must find a partner to work with outside of class The TA will pass around a lab attendance sheet on which you should write your name and your partner s name You must submit your lab assignment through the EEE Dropbox tool following the instructions found here A separate dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments This lab assignment is due Wednesday Nov 5 by 11am You must include all relevant R code used to answer the questions Partner evaluation forms will be available online via EEE Survey after completing and turning in the lab assignment Filling out the partner evaluation form is required of each student submitting a lab assignment Evaluations will be kept confidential your partner will never see what you wrote in your evaluation Problem 1 Practice writing R functions Recall the dice roll simulation from the More Advanced R Commands page Write an R function that will simulate rolling two k sided dice each numbered 1 2 3 k N times and return the proportion of times your sum was greater than or equal to 7 Set the function s default value for k to 6 and the default value for N to 1 Note that on the More Advanced R Commands page we rolled two 6 sided dice 1 times and calculated the proportion of times the sum was equal to 7 Run your R function for k 6 and N 1 Run your R function for k 1 and N 5 Problem 2 The Prisoner s Paradox Suppose that prisoners A B and X are on death row and one of them has been chosen at random with equal probability to be executed the next day Prisoner X asks the guard to tell him which of A and B will not be executed The guard figures that he gives no additional information about whether or not prisoner X will be executed so he decides to tell prisoner X that A will not be executed Assume the guard is telling the truth You are going to conduct a simulation in R to determine if the probability that X is executed has changed with this new information from the guard under three scenarios Assume that if X is the one that will be executed the guard will tell X either A or B will not be executed with equal probability That is assume the following set of conditional probabilities P Guard says A B is going to be executed P Guard says B A is going to be executed 1P Guard says A X is going to be executed P Guard says B X is going to be executed 5 Assume that B s name is hard to pronounce so if at all possible the guard will say prisoner A s name to X That is assume the following set of conditional probabilities P Guard says A B is going to be executed P Guard says B A is going to be executed 1P Guard says A X is going to be executed 1P Guard says B X is going to be executed Assume that A s name is hard to pronounce so if at all possible the guard will say prisoner B s name to X That is assume the following set of conditional probabilities P Guard says A B is going to be executed P Guard says B A is going to be executed 1P Guard says A X is going to be executed P Guard says B X is going to be executed 1 Your task is to write an R function that takes arguments N the number of times to run the simulation and p the conditional probability that the guard answers A given X is going to be executed The function will simulate the process of randomly choosing a prisoner to be executed the guard giving X an answer and checking if X is the one being executed The function should return the conditional empirical probability that X is the one being executed given that the guard answered A For each of the three scenarios run your function to estimate the desired conditional probability using an N of at least 1 Does it seem that the probability that X is executed changes when the guard says A in each scenario Explain Hints Since your function will simulate the process many times the function should have a for loop in it where the for loop runs N times Your function will have to keep track of the number of times the guard says A and the number of times prisoner X is executed and the guard says A Then the desired empirical conditional probability will be the ratio of those two numbers using the definition of conditional probability Stats 12 A Index", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~staceyah/120A/labs/Lab2.html", "title": "lab 2: assignment", "html": "<!DOCTYPE
