We use this\nconstruction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of\nall 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges\nare represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.\nWe also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble\nclusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
