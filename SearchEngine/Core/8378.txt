We are very interested in\nexpanding the scope of our field studies, both within Beckman\nas well as with other software development organizations.\n<P>\nA more comprehensive study than the one reported in this\ndissertation would include one or more of the\nfollowing enhancements: \n<UL><LI>\n<EM>Measure the effects of using the Bayesian models over time,\nespecially its impacts on the quality of human judgment and\ndecision making</EM>.<LI>\n<EM>Construct additional Bayesian models for additional artifact\nnetworks or to model other situations or properties</EM>.\nWe are particularly interested in constructing Bayesian models\nat different levels of granularity, comparing the efficacy of\nresulting models, and, eventually, combining Bayesian models\nwith different granularities.<LI>\n<EM>Afford automated support for definition and revision of \nsoftware belief networks</EM>.  Of special interest are UI design\nissues in constructing belief-network software as well as\nintegration\nof Bayesian capabilities with existing tools, e.g., REBUS,\nDOORS, and RequisitePro.<LI>\n<EM>Finally, this dissertation focused on incorporation of\nsubjective information into software models</EM>.  We are\ninterested in combining subjective and objective data\nin future models.  Specifically, we wish to include\nproject data such as code quality and developer\nproductivity, failure rate and severity, etc., in our\nmodels as factors that influence confidence and,\nultimately, human judgment and decision making.\n</UL><BR> <HR>\n<P><ADDRESS>\n<I>Hadar Ziv <BR>\nFri Jun 20 16:25:19 PDT 1997</I>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 8378.0}
