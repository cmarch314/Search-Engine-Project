triangulations of set of points A in the plane Such a triangulation has vertices at the points of A and its domain covers the convex hull of A It can be viewed as a planar partition of the plane whoses bounded faces are triangular and cover the convex hull of A The single unbounded face of this partition is the complementary of the convex hull of A In many applications it is convenient to deal only with triangular faces Therefore we add to the triangulation a fictitious vertex called the infinite vertex and we make each convex hull edge incident to an infinite face having as third vertex the infinite vertex In that way each edge is incident to exactly two faces and special cases at the boundary of the convex hull are simpler to deal with Figure The infinite vertex The class Triangulation 2 Traits Tds implements this point of view and therefore considers the triangulation of the set of points as a set of triangular finite and infinite faces Although it is convenient to draw a triangulation as in figure note that the infinite vertex has no significant coordinates and that no geometric predicate can be applied on it or on an infinite face A triangulation is a collection of vertices and faces that are linked together through incidence and adjacency relations Each face give access to its three incident vertices and to its three adjacent faces Each vertex give access to one of its incident faces The three vertices of a face are indexed with 1 and 2 in counterclockwise order The neighbor of a face are also indexed with 1 2 in such a way that the neighbor indexed by i is opposite to the vertex with the same index The triangulation class offer two functions int cw int i and int ccw int i which given the index of a vertex in a face compute the index of the next vertex of the same face in clockwise or counterclockwise order Thus for example the neighbor neighbor cw i is the neighbor of f which is next to neighbor i turning clockwise around f The face neighbor cw i is also the first face encountered after f when turning clockwise around vertex i of f see Figure Figure Vertices and neighbors include CGAL Triangulation 2 h ParametersThe

iterators and circulators The handles are models of the concept Handle which basically offers the two dereference operators and The iterators and circulators are all bidirectional and non mutable The circulators and iterators are convertible to handles with the same value type so that whenever a handle appear in the parameter list of a function an appropriate iterator or circulator can be passed as well The edges of the triangulation can also be visited through iterators and circulators the edge circulators and iterators are also bidirectional and non mutable In the following we called infinite any face or edge incident to the infinite vertex and the infinite vertex itself Any other feature face edge or vertex of the triangulation is said to be finite Some iterators the All iterators allows to visit finite or infinite feature while others the Finite iterators visit only finite features Circulators visit infinite features as well as finite ones typedef Tds Vertex handle

locate a point with respect to a given finite face of the triangulation Face handle t locate Point query Face handle f Face handle If the point query lies inside the convex hull of the points a face that contains the query in its interior or on its boundary is returned If the point query lies outside the convex hull of the triangulation but in the affine hull the returned face is an infinite face which is a proof of the point s location for a two dimensional triangulation it is a face p q such that query lies to the left of the oriented line pq the rest of the triangulation lying to the right of this line for a degenerate one dimensional triangulation it is the degenarate one dimensional face p NULL such that query and the triangulation lie on either side of p If the point query lies outside the affine hull the returned Face handle is NULL The optional Face handle argument if provided is used as a hint of where the locate process has to start its search Face handle t locate Point query Locate type lt int li Face handle h Face handle Same as above Additionally the parameters lt and li describe where the query point is located The variable lt is set to the locate type of the query If lt VERTEX the variable li is set to the index of the vertex and if lt EDGE li is set to the index of the vertex opposite to the edge Be careful that li has no meaning when the query type is FACE OUTSIDE CONVEX HULL or OUTSIDE AFFINE HULL or when the triangulation is dimensional Oriented side t oriented side Face handle f Point p Returns on which side of the oriented boundary of f lies the point p Precondition f is finite Oriented side t side of oriented circle Face handle f Point p Returns on which side of the circumcircle of face f lies the point p The circle is assumed to be counterclockwisely oriented so its positive side correspond to its bounded side This predicate is available only if the corresponding predicates on points is provided in the geometric traits class Modifiers The following operations are guaranteed to lead to a valid triangulation when they are applied on a valid triangulation void t flip Face handle f int i Exchanges the edge incident to f and f neighbor i with the other diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by f and f neighbor i Precondition The faces f and f neighbor i are finite faces and their union form a convex quadrilateral Vertex handle t insert Point p Face handle f Face handle Inserts point p in the triangulation and returns the corresponding vertex If point p coincides with an already existing vertex this vertex is returned and the triangulation remains unchanged If point p is on an edge the two incident faces are split in two If point p is strictly inside a face of the triangulation the face is split in three If point p is strictly outside the convex hull p is linked to all visible points on the convex hull to form the new triangulation At last if p is outside the affine hull in case of degenerate 1 dimensional or dimensional triangulations p is linked all the other vertices to form a triangulation whose dimension is increased by one The last argument f is an indication to the underlying locate algorithm of where to start Vertex handle t insert Point p Locate type lt Face handle loc int li Same as above except that the location of the point p to be inserted is assumed to be given by lt loc i see the description of the locate method above Vertex handle t push back Point p Equivalent to insert p template class InputIterator int t insert InputIterator first InputIterator last Inserts the points in the range first last Returns the number of inserted points Precondition The value type of InputIterator is Point void t remove Vertex handle v Removes the vertex from the triangulation The created hole is retriangulated Precondition Vertex v must be finite Figure Insertion of a point on an edge Figure Insertion in a face Figure Insertion outside the convex hull Figure Removal advanced The following member functions offer more specialized versions of the insertion or removal operations to be used when one knows to be in the corresponding case Vertex handle t insert first Point p Inserts

new faces are created Precondition The point in vertex v lies inside face f Vertex handle t insert in edge Point p Face handle f int i Inserts vertex v in edge i of f Precondition The point in vertex v lies on the edge opposite to the vertex i of face f Vertex handle t insert outside convex hull Point p Face handle f Inserts a point which is outside the convex hull but in the affine hull Precondition The handle f points to a face which is a proof of the location ofp see the description of the locate method above Vertex handle t insert outside affine hull Point p Inserts a point which is outside the affine hull void t remove degree 3 Vertex handle v Removes a vertex of degree three Two of the incident faces are destroyed the third one is modified Precondition Vertex v is a finite vertex with degree three void t remove second Vertex handle v Removes the before last finite vertex void t remove first Vertex handle v Removes the last finite vertex The following fonctions are mainly intended to be used in conjunction with the find conflicts member fonctions of Delaunay and constrained Delaunay triangulations to perform insertions template class EdgeIt Vertex handle t star

vertex template class EdgeIt class FaceIt Vertex handle t star hole Point p EdgeIt edge begin EdgeIt edge end FaceIt face begin FaceIt face end same as above except that the algorithm first recycles faces in the sequence face begin face end and create new ones only when the sequence is exhausted advanced Traversal of the Triangulation A triangulation can be seen as a container of faces and vertices Therefore the triangulation provides several iterators and circulators that allow to traverse it completely or partially Face Edge and Vertex Iterators The following iterators allow respectively to visit finite faces finite edges and finite vertices of the triangulation These iterators are non mutable bidirectional and their value types are respectively Face Edge and Vertex They are all invalidated by any change in the triangulation Finite vertices iterator t finite vertices begin Starts at an arbitrary finite vertex Finite vertices iterator t finite vertices end Past the end

respectively to visit all finite or infinite faces edges and vertices of the triangulation These iterators are non mutable bidirectional and their value types are respectively Face Edge and Vertex They are all invalidated by any change in the triangulation All vertices iterator t all vertices begin Starts at an arbitrary vertex All vertices iterator t all vertices end Past the end iterator All edges iterator t all edges begin Starts at an arbitrary edge All edges iterator t all edges end Past the end iterator All faces iterator t all faces begin Starts at an arbitrary face All faces iterator t all faces end Past the end iterator Line Face Circulator The triangulation defines a circulator that allows to visit all faces that are intersected by a line A face f is considered has being intersected by the oriented line l if either f is a finite face whose interior intersects l or f is a finite face with an edge collinear with l and lies to the left of l or f is an infinite face incident to a convex hull edge whose interior is intersected by l or f is an infinite face incident to a convex hull vertex lying on l and the finite edge of f lies to the left of l The circulator has a singular value if the line l intersect no finite face of the triangulation This circulator is non mutable and bidirectional Its value type is Face Line face circulator t line walk Point p Point q Face handle f Face handle This function returns a circulator that allows to visit the faces intersected by the line pq If there is no such face the circulator has a singular value The starting point of the circulator is the face f or if f is omitted the first finite face traversed by l The circulator wraps around the infinite vertex after the last traversed finite face it steps through the infinite face adjacent to this face then through the infinite face adjacent to the first traversed finite face then through the first finite traversed face again Precondition Points p and q must be different points Precondition If f NULL the point p must be inside or on the boundary of f Figure illustrates which finite faces are enumerated Lines l1 and l2 have no face to their left Lines l3 and l4 have faces to their left Note that the finite faces that are only vertex incident to lines l3 and l4 are not enumerated Figure The line face circulator A line face circulator is invalidated if the face the circulator refers to is changed Face Edge and Vertex Circulators The triangulation also provides circulators that allows to visit respectively all faces or edges incident to a given vertex or all vertices adjacent to a given vertex These circulators are non mutable and bidirectional The operator moves the circulator counterclockwise around the vertex while the operator moves clockwise A face circulator is invalidated by any modification of the face pointed to An edge or a vertex circulator are invalidated by any modification of one of the two faces incident to the edge pointed to Face circulator t incident faces Vertex handle v Starts at an arbitrary face incident to v Face circulator t incident faces Vertex handle v Face handle f Starts at face f Precondition Face f is incident to vertex v Edge circulator t incident edges Vertex handle v Starts at an arbitrary edge incident to v Edge circulator t incident edges Vertex handle v Face handle f Starts at the the first edge of f incident to v in counterclockwise order around v Precondition Face f is incident to vertex v Vertex circulator t incident vertices Vertex handle v Starts at an arbitrary vertex incident to v Vertex circulator t incident vertices Vertex handle v Face handle f Starts at the first vertex of f adjacent to v in counterclockwise order around v Precondition Face f is incident to vertex v Traversal of the Convex Hull Applied on the infinite vertex the above functions allow to visit the vertices on the convex hull and the infinite edges and faces Note that a counterclockwise traversal of the vertices adjacent to the infinite vertex is a clockwise traversal of the convex hull Face circulator t incident faces t infinite vertex Face circulator t incident faces t infinite vertex Face

advanced Setting void t set infinite vertex Vertex handle v Checking The responsibility of keeping a valid triangulation belongs to the users if advanced operations are used Obviously the advanced user who implements higher levels operations may have to make a triangulation invalid at some times The following method is provided to help the debugging bool t is valid bool verbose false int level Checks the combinatorial validity of the triangulation and also the validity of its geometric embedding This method is mainly a debugging help for the users of advanced features advanced I O The I O operators are defined for iostream The format for the iostream is an internal format ostream ostream os T Inserts the triangulation t into the stream os Precondition The insert operator must be defined for Point istream istream is T Reads a triangulation from stream is and assigns it to t Precondition The extract operator must be defined for Point The information ouput in the iostream is the dimension the number of vertices including the infinite one and the number of faces including infinite ones for each vertex except the infinite vertex the non combinatorial information stored in that vertex point etc for each faces the indices of its vertices and the non combinatorial information if any in this face for each face again the indices of the neighboring faces The index of an item vertex of face is the rank of this item in the ouput order When dimension 2 the same information is ouput for faces of maximal dimension instead of faces CGAL also provides stream operators to draw triangulations on CGAL Window stream the LEDA based graphic package and on CGAL Qt widget the Qt based graphic package These operators requires respectively the include statements include CGAL IO Window stream h include CGAL IO Qt widget Triangulation 2 h See the chapters on Window stream and on Qt widget in the Support Library manual Implementation Locate is implemented by a line walk from a vertex of the face given as optional parameter or from a finite vertex of infinite face if no optional parameter is given It takes time O n in the worst case but only O sqrt n on average if the vertices are distributed uniformly at random Insertion of a point is done by locating a face that contains the point and then splitting this face If the point falls outside the convex hull the triangulation is restored by flips Apart from the location insertion takes a time time O 1 This bound is only an amortized bound for points located outside the convex hull Removal of a vertex is done by removing all adjacent triangles and retriangulating the hole Removal takes time O d 2 in the worst case if d is the degree of the removed vertex which is O 1 for a random vertex The face edge and vertex iterators on finite features are derived from their counterparts visiting all finite and infinite features which are themselves derived from the corresponding iterators of the triangulation
