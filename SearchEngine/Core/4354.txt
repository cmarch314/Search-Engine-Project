this project is to develop analytic methods that enable scientists to efficiently and automatcially discover relationships between shape and function in biological systems This work has been supported by the NSF Emerging Frontiers and Biological Infrastructure Divisions in the form of a large collaborative effort on bioshape bioshapes org DBI 1 53 36 and a collaborative project on bioimage analysis for understanding pollen morphology and texture DBI 1262547 Pollen Texture based Classification and Analysis with Punyasena Lab at UIUC The practice of identifying pollen has a large number of scientific applications and is used in fields as diverse as archaeology biostratigraphy the dating of rocks and forensic science Pollen and spores play a particularly important role in paleontology because they form the most abundant and extensive record of plant diversity dating back hundreds of millions of years However many critical hypotheses in plant ecology and evolution e g the assembly of plant communities speciation and extinction cannot be fully tested with pollen data due to the extreme difficulty of recognizing species from pollen and spore material We are developing methods for automatically classifying pollen based on texture and shape features This approach has been validated in distinguishing visually similar SEM images of pollen from several different species based on

function properly it must be active in the right place at the right time and in the right amount Changes in any of these features can lead to observable differences between individuals and species and in some cases can lead to disease We do not currently understand how the position timing and amount of gene expression is encoded in DNA sequence One approach to this problem is to compare how gene expression differs between species and to try to relate changes in DNA sequence to changes in gene expression We are developing methods for measuring and comparing gene expression patterns at high spatial and temporal resolution between embryos of different species of Drosophila The methods allow us to control for variation in the size shape and number of nuclei between embryos Publications M

We are developing methods that leverage\n        accurate simulation of acoustical propagation to understand the\n        functional importance of aspects of bat ear and noseleaf shape.\n        We exploit the adjoint method to efficiently perform a global \n        analysis of the sensitivity of acoustical performance to shape\n        features. \n\n        <br><br>\n        <br><br>\n        </li>\n\n        <br><br>\n        <br><br>\n\n        <br><br>\n        <br><br>\n        <hr>\n        <img style=\"float:right; padding: 10px\" width=300 src=\"heart.gif\">\n        Registration of chick embryo outflow tract dynamics with\n        fluorescence microscopy-based protein expression data (with <a\n        href=\"http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/research/biological-shape-spaces.cfm\">Rugyoni Lab at OHSU</a>)\n        <br><br>\n        It is known that changes in hemodynamic forces affect developmental\n        growth of the heart but mechanisms underlying this process are not well\n        understood.
