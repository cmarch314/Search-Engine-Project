{"text": "Research Development Research oriented Progressive Group of Picture PGOP In the motion video encoding I frame is inevitable I frame is capable of stopping temporal error propagation or say error drifting caused by the inter frame compression techniques like motion estimation compensation Without I frame the impact of channel data loss on one frame may affect its following frames and seriously degrades the system fidelity Hence I frame is crucial in all video coding standards H 26x and MPEG x and provides the functionality of fidelity sync point for the whole video communication system However I frame has the lowest compression efficiency comparing to other frame type i e P frame and B frame That is I frame leads to high bit rate for the same encoding quality This casts great difficulties to the rate control and end system buffer regulation especially for the low bit rate video applications PGOP is designed to solve the bit rate unevenness caused by I frame while providing the explicit fidelity sync point such that the temporal error propagation can be eliminated in a timely manner In addition PGOP is encoder based and doesn t add much complexity overhead compared with I frame Hence PGOP is proposed to replace the I frame in the low bit rate scenario PGOP consumes so little overhead that it can be easily implemented even on the low end hand held devices such as PDA

conference Real time quality adaptive error resilient MPEG 4 encoder In the video communication the encoders and decoders are normally geographically scattered Because the decoder is essentially a passive and best effort mechanism the intermediate network loss inevitably enters the decoder s prediction loop and consistently degrade the decoding quality On the other hand although the encoder is capable of adjusting the trade off between the error resilience and the coding efficiency the encoder is unaware of latest decoding situation and thus can hardly make the accurate decision Based on the research of the Institute for Telecommunication Science ITS we extract the decoding quality features and transmit them back to the encoder in a real time mode This allows us to bypass the timing varying networks and the heterogeneous decoder implementations and focus on their ultimate impacts on the decoding video quality We establish a practical end to end adaptation system that is universal

to any network connected location by way of streaming 3D graphics The idea is to define a client server architecture that by exploiting the state of the art video streaming techniques allows interactive visualization of 3D environments and data sets on clients with thin computing and rendering resources Within this architecture the clients send commands and manipulate the 3D models that are stored at the remote server The visualization server performs 3D rendering and streaming allowing the clients to view the results of their requests in real time Unlike conventional video streaming the server should enable the transmission of real time encoded video from 3D graphics instead of pre compressed video Hence it is crucial to accelerate the speed up of the encoding process We propose
