could help with this one but the only one that I know of is my grandfather Moses Moshe For some reason no one in the family knows the names of any of his siblings just that Zvi was from Hungary and born somewhere in the 182 3 range Zvi had died by 1896 since the first child to my grandparents was a boy named Hersh Melech who died shortly after birth and was born in 1896 I know the names of a few of his siblings children who were my grandfather s age One of his siblings sons obviously a brother was Abe Schonfeld who accompanied my grandmother here in 1912 June or so to New York and two sisters Esther Weisman and Fannie Goldberg who were about my grandmother s age so born about 1875 to another of his siblings but dont know if they were Schoenfelds by maiden name or not Marge Hi Can we start

bring you up to date on where my WEINBERGER research is holding I have recently uncovered some new information that seems to link us more closely Bertha wrote of her great uncle being married to a Roza Lehrer This family turns out to be descendents of PESACH MOSHE and BRACHA Weinberger This means that the NECHEMIA that Bertha Schwartz and Dr Judith Lobel come from had a sister named RIVKA This Rivka married Shmuel Lehrer and had Rosa and others I have been in touch with several descendents of Rivka living in the NY area and Antwerp too They also know that Rabbi Fischel Weinberger of Yad Eliyahu in Israel and his brother Shmuel were cousins Their father was Yakov He may have been either a brother or nephew to Nechemia and Rivka This connection is only a guess right now I am trying to contact somebody from that family to find out the name of Yakov s father So so far we have Brucha and Pesach Moshe with two children Nechemia and Rivka They possibly had another named Yakov Also please remember that the Bnei Yissochur 1783 1841 was named R Hersh Meylech Spira He was married to Chane Mindel surname unknown They had seven children You can view this list at http www ics uci edu dan genealogy Miller spira bny yscr htm Now getting back to bringing us altogether Bertha wrote about some of the family going to Munkacz Linda Cohen wrote about some Weinberg er family that came to the USA from Munkacz Maybe somebody can supply more information on this part There may be some connection there There is the Pesach Moshe Koifman that I am hoping lisadan internet zahav net will tell us about Most importantly Gail Furst wrote about a Hersh Meylech Weinberger who had a daughter named Chana Mindel born in Dubiecko This family MUST be related having the names of both the Bnei Yissochur and his wife in their family Perhaps somebody can supply a contact to Moishe Gewirtz or some other family members from this branch Also Gail can you supply an approximate time frame for when Hersh Mylech Weinberger lived It may be that he was yet another sibling to Nechemial and Rivka Going back to the beginning once again the parents of Nechemia and Rivka were Pesach Moshe and Bracha I have no proof as to which one was the Weinberger In those days it was not uncommon to only have a Jewish wedding ceremony with no corresponding civil record This would usually result in the children retaining the maiden name of the mother In our case there are possibilities It might be that Pesach Moshe was named after the father of the Bnei Yissochur whose name was Pesach It might be that Bracha was the connection If she was it might be that she was a daughter of Baila who was the daughter of the Bnei Yissochur There is no evidence that the Bnei Yissochur had more than the seven known children Bracha NOT being one of them Also given the dates involved she would have been to old to have been his child Of course Bracha could have been almost any else s child too I hope that we can work together to try and put more of this into place I have recorded much of out earlier emails and they can be found at http www ics uci edu dan genealogy Miller spira brknspir htm I will try to review the ship records available at the Ellis Island website for any possible new leads Please respond at least to let me know your own thoughts on how to continue from here Sincerely Moishe Miller

Fischel married Chana Teumim daughter of R Zev Teumim ADMUR Zaleshchiki When R Zev passed on in 1931 the two candidates for succession were his son in law R Fishel Weinberger of Przemysl and R Mordechai Sprecher a rabbinical judge Neither was elected and both subsequently served as rabbinical judges with the title ABD Fischel s wife and children perished in the Holocaust and he alone escaped to Israel in 1944 In 1946 he married Rivka Kliers and accepted the post of Rabbi of Yad eliyahu next to Tel Aviv He had a brother Shmuel in Bnei Brak who passed away 29 October 1974 Shmuel was married to Weinberger family as well Perhaps Fischel and Shmuel s father Yakov was also a son of Pesach Moshe and Bracha Weinberger In the sefer Bnei Ephraim he writes of his lineage This was

granddaughter of the Dinuver Rebbe the Bnai Yisoschor I never heard that last name I am pretty sure that the lineage transferred to the Rand s rather than through the Weinberger Tati s father was 1884 1924 I am pretty sure that Tati said that his mother and father were shiduched in a village in the Carpathians when his father was about 2 years old when one of the families came up from the Munkaczer side of the mountains and the other from the Galizianer side I forget which was which And that the rand family moved into Munkacz around the start of World War I In 192 Yaakov Tzvi Rand was arrested in Munkacz and held for about two weeks because of some WW I evasion of draft service He was according to tati turned in by a Jewish informer and eventually freed by a judge thanks to help from a

Isaac Perlmutter and Rochel Leah who was married to Naftali Seidenfeld Zeidenfled were children of R Yakov Uri and Rifka Spira or her neice Yitta Leah are FALSE However it may still be that they do descend from some other branch of the Bnei Yissoschur family The Munkacz death record of Rochel Leah Zeidenfled Seidenfeld clearly states that her maiden name was REITER and not URI or SPIRA or SCHONFELD The Mako and Kisvarda records from Hungary show numerous entries for PERLMUTTER with the mother s name being Rezi REITER With the assistance of Dov Weber we can conclude that Reizel Perlmutter Ruchel Lea Zeidenfeld were daughters of Yakov Eliezer Reiter Binah and not to the Uri family at all For their detail should a new connection be found see their family page I would be very

As a matter of \n\tfact, I think I once spoke to you when I was in NY visiting my brother, \n\tChaiim Baruch (Harry) Schonfeld.  Anyway, we've always heard from our \n\tfather, Moshe, A&quot;H, and from other relatives, that we were descended from \n\tthe Bnei Yissoschor.v  However, noone seems to know how.  I've asked and \n\tasked.  Some versions I've heard &quot;shtimt nisht&quot;.  Maybe because you've \n\tdone much more research than I have, and are more well versed with \n\tSeforim, you would know.\n    \n\tA 2nd cousin of mine, a Margareten (ben Hinda Schonfeld Margareten) \n\treportedly went to the Blushever, z&quot;l, andd asked him if we are related \n\tto the B&quot;Y and he answered &quot;Avada&quot; (certainly). \n\t\n    Also, to change the subject somewhat, could you tell me about the \n\tMiller-Schonfeld connection.  We had several occassions to speak with family \n\tmembers of Pesach Dovid Schonfeld, A&quot;H, but unfortunately all those \n\toccassions were when we or they were sitting Shiva.  We are related to that \n\tfamily through 2 different connections.\n    \n\tAnyway, here is our Yichus-please let me know what you know, and I will do \n\tlikewise:\n \n    My father:   Moshe Schonfeld                \n\t           + Pesel Lifshe Goldberger (a Lisker grandchild)\n      gfather    Chaim Baruch Schonfeld         \n\t           + Malya Weinberger\n     ggfather    Naftali Yeshaya Asher Schonfeld\n\t           + Esther Wohl, \n\t             Shprintza Shaindel Wohl (Hanucovce)\n    gggfather    Menachem Mendel Schonfeld      \n\t           + Sora Blima ?\n   ggggfather    Eliezer Schonfeld              \n               + ?\n \n                               Looking forward to hearing from you,\n                               Elizabeth Feder\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nFrom: &quot;Larry R.

Unfortunately, these\nhints have not helped me discover the answer, but nevertheless:\n(1)  In talking to my father A&quot;H's first cousin, she said she thought the\nconnection was through the mother.  The Wohl sisters, who were wives to\nNaftali Yeshaya Asher (I am named for them)  were descended from Shaul Wahl,\nthe Polish king for a day.  Their parents were Yaakov Yehuda and Rivka bas\nMoshe Chaim (maiden name unknown) Wohl.\n(2)  When I was in Israel this past summer, I met another branch of the\nfamily for the first time.  They are descendants of Naftali's brother\nYechiel Mechel Schonfeld, who lived in Uhely.  They said they did not get\nthe &quot;Kabbala&quot; that their branch stems from the B&quot;Y, but were knowlegeable\nthat that Naftali &amp; Yechiel's uncle, Moshe, was the B&quot;Y's son-in-law.\n\n\nThe dates:\nMy father, obm Moshe Schonfeld, b. **** in Cz, d. Pesach ****\nGfather Chaim Baruch b, 1879, d. 1929\nNaftali Yeshaya Asher Schonfeld b. about 1840, d.

Here is my Schoenfeld tree:\nI am Marge Neff Schechner, daughter of Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff. She is the\nyoungest of seven children of Moses (and Rose Schreier) Schoenfeld, who was\nborn in Boryslav(then Austria) in 1867, the 8th of 10 children of Tzvi\nElimelech and Bella Richter Schoenfeld. Tzvi had another wife before Bella\nwith whom he had two children who he left with his former in laws somewhere\nin Hungary. He then married Bella and had another 8 children with her. My\nTzvi antecendent died sometime around 1920. Since my grandfather, Moses,was\nthe 8th of 10 children, I can assume that Tzvi was born sometime around\n1825-1830. Unfortunately, I don't know the names of any of my grandfather's\nsiblings. He had a nephew named Abraham Schoenfeld, who was born about 1890\nand married a woman named Rose, and a niece named Esther who married a man\nnamed Moishe Weisman. They had 3 children named Irving,Hannah(born about\n1912) and Belle who married a man named Harold Cole(Cohen.

Bertha was named for her grandmother, Bella Richter\nSchoenfeld, wife of Tzvi Elimelech.\nThere was a child born about two years before Bertha, named Harry(Hersh\nMelech or Tzvi Elimelech) born about 1896 or 97 but he died at age 6\nmonths.Bertha and Harry were born in Boryslav.\n\n\nMoses Schoenfeld was born in Boryslav in 1867.\nRose Schreier Schoenfeld was born in Drohobycz in 1876.\n\n\nI have no information regarding any of my grandfathers siblings. Family\nstory is that he was the 8th of 10 children born to Tzvi from his second\nwife, Bella. The first two children were from the first wife and were left\nwith her parents in Hungary when he married Bella. I have the names of\nseveral of Moses nieces and a nephew.\nAbraham Schoenfeld; accompanied my grandmother to the US in 1912 and was\nthen 22 years old. He married a woman named Rose and they had two children.\nEsther Zukerman Magid came here in October, 1912 on the Kaiser August\nVictoria with my mother's five older siblings. She married a man named Max.\nEsther Weisman, a niece, married to a man named Moishe. Had 3 children named\nIrving, Hannah (b.1912), and Bella (b.1906) married a man named Harold Cohen\nwho changed the name to Cole.\n\n\nI can only guess as to when Bella and Tzvi died since my grandparents named\ntheir first two children after them. My mother told me that Tzvi's yartzeit\nwas on 28 Tevet and I would assume that he had died by the time Harry was\nborn in 1896.Bella's yartzeit is 1 Shevat.

Bertha wrote of her great-uncle being married to a Roza Lehrer. \nThis family turns out to be descendents of PESACH MOSHE and BRACHA \nWeinberger. This means that the NECHEMIA that Bertha Schwartz and Dr.\nJudith Lobel come from had a sister named RIVKA. This Rivka married \nShmuel Lehrer and had Rosa (and others). \n\nI have been in touch with several descendents of Rivka, living in the NY \narea and Antwerp too. They also know that Rabbi Fischel Weinberger of Yad \nEliyahu in Israel and his brother Shmuel were cousins. Their father was \nYakov. He may have been either a brother or nephew to Nechemia and Rivka.\nThis connection is only a guess right now. I am trying to contact somebody \nfrom that family to find out the name of Yakov's father. \n\nSo, so far we have Brucha and Pesach Moshe with two children, Nechemia and \nRivka. They possibly had another named Yakov. Also, please remember that \nthe Bnei Yissochur (1783 - 1841) was named R' Hersh Meylech Spira. He was \nmarried to Chane Mindel, surname unknown. They had seven children. You can \nview this list at\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm\n\nNow, getting back to bringing us altogether. Bertha wrote about some of the \nfamily going to Munkacz. Linda Cohen wrote about some Weinberg/er family that \ncame to the USA from Munkacz. Maybe somebody can supply more information on \nthis part.There may be some connection there. \n\nThere is the Pesach Moshe Koifman, that I am hoping lisadan@internet-zahav.net\nwill tell us about.\n\nMost importantly, Gail Furst wrote about a Hersh Meylech Weinberger who had\na daughter named Chana Mindel, born in Dubiecko. This family MUST be related, \nhaving the names of both the Bnei Yissochur and his wife in their family. \nPerhaps somebody can supply a contact to Moishe Gewirtz or some other family \nmembers from this branch. Also, Gail, can you supply an approximate time frame\nfor when Hersh Mylech Weinberger lived? It may be that he was yet another \nsibling to Nechemial and Rivka. \n\nGoing back to the beginning, once again, the parents of Nechemia and Rivka \nwere Pesach Moshe and Bracha. I have no proof as to which one was the \nWeinberger. In those days, it was not uncommon to only have a Jewish \nwedding ceremony, with no corresponding civil record. This would \nusually result in the children retaining the maiden name of the mother.\nIn our case, there are possibilities. It might be that Pesach Moshe was \nnamed after the father of the Bnei Yissochur, whose name was Pesach. It \nmight be that Bracha was the connection. If she was, it might be that she \nwas a daughter of Baila, who was the daughter of the Bnei Yissochur. There \nis no evidence that the Bnei Yissochur had more than the seven known children,\nBracha NOT being one of them. Also, given the dates involved, she would have \nbeen to old to have been his child. Of course, Bracha could have been almost \nany else's child too.\n\nI hope that we can work together to try and put more of this into place. I\nhave recorded much of out earlier emails and they can be found at\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/brknspir.htm\n\nI will try to review the ship records available at the Ellis Island website \nfor any possible new leads.\n\nPlease respond, at least to let me know your own thoughts on how to continue\nfrom here.\n\nSincerely,\nMoishe Miller\nmoishe@langsam.com \n__________________________________________________________________________\n</pre>\nFor an overview of Pesach Moshe and Bracha's two known children <a href=\"nchmwbrg.htm\">Nechemia</a> \nand <a href=\"rvkalhrr.htm\">Rivka</a>, please see their trees.\n<p>\n<strong>R' Fischel Weinberger</strong><br>\nIn Rabbi Meir Wunder's encyclopedia of Galician Scholars , II:824, he mentions \na (Ephraim) Fischel Weinberg (1912 - 1964).

He related the following:\n\nHis wife, Rivka SIMON, is the daughter of Pinchus Shlomo SIMON and Perel\nEHRENFELD (1912 - 1994). This Perel was the daughter of Tzvi EHRENFELD and\nKreindel HAPLERIN (or HALPERT) of Mako, Hungary. Rabbi Weissberger believes\nthat the connection is probably via this Kreindel, whose parents were Yona\nZev Ha'Levi, the shochet in Mako, and Esther BERENSTEIN (daughter of Yakov\nYitzchok Ha'cohen and Margolit Rivka, also of Mako, Hungary). Yona Zev was\noriginally from Mukachevo before going to Mako.

It is always nice to communicate with a landzman.\n \nRegards, Erwin Diller, Encino, California\n__________________________________________________________________\nFrom: Mazal1@aol.com \nSubject: Re: DILLER from Dynow \nDate: Tue, 14 Dec 2004 08:57:43 EST \nTo: moishe@langsam.com \n\nSorry I do not have any knowledge of the people you mention.
