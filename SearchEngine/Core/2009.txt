{"text": "Announcements ICS 33 Intermediate Programming 12 2 17 15 Quiz 5 Graded I have graded and recorded the grades for Quiz 5 The class average was about 2 or about 82 the median was about 23 or about 92 Last quarter the class average was about 21 or about 83 the median was about 22 or about 88 Look at your returned work carefully if your score was below 2 which is 8 you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA Material similar to this will be on the first written exam Always see your TA first for grading issues with Quizzes There are two files that you should download unzip and examine to understand you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class Each is sorted by Unique ID To compute your Unique ID go to the grades spreadsheet that is available from the index on the course web and go to the tab labeled UniqueID and enter your ID in the green cell A2 and press Enter your Unique ID will appear to the right in cell B2 The first file to examine stores the assignment grades a zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this instrument why points were deducted All problems were graded on the computer Column C shows the number of batch self check failures for question 1 columns D E show the number of batch self check failures for question 2 columns F G show the number of batch self check failures for question 3 I used the same checks that I distributed with the assignment The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from the index on the course web it records all the grades for all the testing instruments that I assign over the quarter It is sorted likewise You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to integers so receiving a 27 5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 28 on the second one We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter There are no written quizzes to return Please download the Grades zipped xlsm file from the course web and ensure that I have computed and entered your grade correctly I ll be entering thousands of grades for students in my courses this quarter so even if I m 99 accurate I m likely to record some incorrect grades Note that all grades are recorded as integral values I always round up e g a quiz score of 22 5 is recorded as 23 If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly please contact your TA first see above and tell him her what you think the differences are Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes either he she will agree with you that you deserve more credit and we do want you to receive all the credit that you are due or you will come to understand the question program or solution better This is certainly a win win situation Please read the solution and assignment grades spreadsheet carefully before contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct answers Your TA will then re examine issue possibly asking you for more information if there is still confusion or arranging to talk to you If there is a difference your TA will email me a revised summary about your program and cc a copy to you I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate it might take a bit of time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade If you feel there is still a problem after talking to your TA please contact me but always contact your TA first Also because of the size of this class if you have a grading issue you must bring it to TA s attention within a week of when I return the materials Generally exams written and programming and quizzes are graded more closely than programming assignments If the average on any testing instrument is less than 75 the column for that instrument will show the number of normalization points the number of points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument s average be 75 these number of points are then added to the sum of the points for each student in a later column This is the only curving I do in grading On this testing instrument and typically most others except the written exams the normalization points are Each problem had 2 5 points for passing the tests and 2 5 points for having an appropriate recursive solution Inappropriate solutions involve iteration of any kind instead of recursion or the creation of any unnecessary large data

graded Contact the TA of the submitting student for problems with the grading of any programming assignments There are two files that you should download unzip and examine to understand you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class The first stores the assignment grades a zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this instrument why points were deducted You will see negative numbers in cells for which points were deducted telling how many bsc tests they failed these are exactly the same bsc files that were distributed with the assignment Some cells contain a red triangle in their upper right hand corner if you hover over these cells you will see a comment about the cell s contents This file is sorted by unique ID The second

likewise You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to integers so receiving a 57 5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 58 on the second one We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter This assignment was designed to test if you have a good grasp of overloading methods in classes understand iterators and generators which typically implement iterators and decorators for iterators Some students submitted py files that contained syntax errors such files fail all bst tests if any of your py files failed all their bsc tests you might want to check with your TA during Lab whether they had simple syntax errors if they did the TA can rerun the tests and report the new results to me although their will be points deducted for submitting files with syntax errors Some students are still submitting the Submitter Partner information wrong for which points are deducted The class average was 41 or about 82 and the median was 46 or about 92 There were 56 As 12 Bs 8 Cs and 24 Ds and Fs About 18 of the submissions were 2 days early about 9 were one day early Last quarter the average was about 77 and the median was

of when I return the materials 9 1 3 15 In Lab Programming Exam 1 Graded I have graded In Lab Programming Exam 1 and updated the main grades spreadsheet I changed the the way that I graded this exam from the published criteria I dropped everyone s lowest score for one problem so effectively you were graded on writing 4 problems each worth 25 points The result of this grading change was that everyone s grade either stayed the same only if you scored a or 1 using the original criteria or increased I believe the In Lab Exams ar the best indicator of all testing instruments of your ability to program As I ll say in class Tolstoy is often quoted from Anna Karenina as writing Happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way My adaptation of this quote is High scoring students are all alike knowing how to program well every low scoring student did poorly in his her own way lack of programming ability freezing on the exam misunderstanding the problem statements spending too much time debugging one problem being ill when taking the exam etc Using the updated grading criteria the class average was about 7 and the median was about 83 last quarter the class average was about 67 and median was about 88 Because the average was below 75 about 5 normalization points 5 are added in for this problem when the average of all graded instruments is computed The grades recorded in the spreadsheet are the actual exam grades the final columns adds in the normalization points for all instruments for now all are except for In Lab Exam 1 A few students submitted functions with syntax errors for these students I deducted 2 points and I replaced the incorrect statement and all following statements in the function body by pass that function then failed all its tests but it allowed the automatic grading program to grade all the other functions Notice the large skew between the Average 7 and the Median 83 scores half the students scored 88 a high B but many students who scored lower scored very poorly dragging down the average A total of 4 of the students scored 1 in fact even 3 scored 1 when graded on all 5 problems and 5 scored these students did not get any functions to pass any of their batch self check tests The approximate distribution of grades on this In Lab exam after normalization is 43 As 9 Bs 1 Cs 7 Ds and 31 Fs last quarter it was is 46 As 6 Bs 6 Cs 6 Ds and 36 Fs This U shaped distribution mostly As and Fs is not uncommon on In Lab Programming Exams where we are testing mastery of programming concepts Examine the assignment grades a zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this instrument the columns show how many of the batch self check tests failed These were similar to the tests that appeared in the driver of the file you downloaded for the exam but all produce differents results because some students hard code the answer into their functons they just copy paste the correct answer returned for one of the problems hoping to get some correctness points Finally this file is sorted by unique ID Finally there were 9 students who scored less than 5 on the In Lab exam who also scored over 9 on Programming Assignment 1 I m concerned that these students let their partners do all the work and did not understand the code that they submitted whether they did so accidentally or on purpose Between the points on the written and In Lab exams these students are unlikely to pass the course and if they do pass the course they will be unprepared for later programming courses whether they use Python or not 8 1 29 15 Quiz 3 Graded I have graded and recorded the grades for Quiz 3 The class average was about 21 or about 83 the median was about 22 or about 88 Last quarter the class

the normalization points are If you scored very low on this quiz you should ask yourself whether you are properly prepared for this course or whether it was lack or time or some other issue that causes a poor performance Possibly you barely passed ICS 32 but really don t understand the material or how to program as well as most of the other students If you do not think you are well prepared you should find a way to improve your Python skills before taking this course If you do not think you are well prepared you should find a way to improve your Python skills before taking this course Why Well you might flunk this course technically anything less than a C and you cannot continue with other courses and have to take it over but most students who flunk a course flunk it because they didn t learn what they needed in the prerequisite course if that is true you might take this course multiple times and still flunk it because your Python skills aren t what they need to be Even worse if you squeak by and barely pass this course you are now done with a year of programming but haven t learned what you need to thrive in later classes at UCI this is really a worse outcome than flunking because it sets you up for failure further in your studies when it is even more difficult to get caught up I m happy to talk to students who feel ill prepared for this course and would like to explore their options 4 1 11 15 Programming Assignment Graded Programming Assignment has been graded There are two files that you should download unzip and examine to understand your performance on

spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to integers so receiving a 27 5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 28 on the second one We will use this same round up process for recording all grades during the quarter This assignment was designed to test you on whether you have mastered the basics of using Python in Eclipse the Eclipse Debugger perspective and batch self check files in the driver py module in courselib It was also designed to see if you could follow instructions and ask questions more on that below The class average was 29 or about 95 and the median was 3 or about 1 There were 81 As 7 Bs 6 Cs and 6 Ds and Fs of those student who turned in any work The assignment was not meant to be hard but it was not trivial either and there were many opportunities to lose points Let me talk about what will probably be the most contentious single point of the 1 points that this course is worth thus 1 of the grade the point was lost by 5 students or about 29 I took off 1 point if you corrected the misspelling Inteprxter and two points if you didn t have either spelling in this second case you obvious failed to meet the specifications because you did not print what was required When some students hear about this point deduction their heads explode and they cannot believe that I am taking off a point for correcting what you probably thought was my mistake But I am trying to foster an atmosphere where nothing is taken for granted in the instructions I give if anything seems confusing or plain wrong I should be questioned about it preferably in public so others can learn about the problem and the correction For some background check out my story about Mr Lill in the course overview Some students did ask me outside of class if they should correct the misspelling and I told them no some students asked me by email if they should correct the misspelling and I told them no but no student asked on the Forum whether they should have corrected the misspelling if one did I would have answered no there for all students in the class to see It is critical for programmers to be sure they know the specifications of the problem they are being asked to solve otherwise they will solve test debug document etc the problem incorrectly and another cycle of development will be needed to fix the misconceptions The overview lecture included a graph that showed that the later in development a problem is found the harder more expensive it is to fix So if we can find problems at the time we are reading the specification of the problem to solve that can save us a lot of work money later The bottom line is that you are responsible for reading the instructions carefully and reporting any confusion so that I can clear it up best reported on the MessageBoard Forum for Programming Assignments Of course you can freely talk to anyone about the problem specifications just not the code that you write for your solutions If you make any assumptions like the node names in Programming Assignment 1 always being one letter long that is not part of the specification they might come back later to haunt you gradewise When working with a partner you ll have two eyes reading the specification I am willing to deduct this painful point at the start of the quarter from many students to get across this perspective Also some students did not carefully read the instructions in the Debugger Perspective document for the quiz part which required them to change a line in the craps script before running it with the debugger to gather the required information With this change in your program you can find the answers we need to check without it you cannot Finally 59 students 35 submitted the program 2 or more days early 39 students 23 submitted the program 1 day early Keep up the good work you can earn 12 points if you turn in every Programming Assignment 2 days early IMPORTANT If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly please contact your TA first see above and tell him her what you think the differences are Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes either he will agree with you that you deserve more credit and we do want you to receive all the credit that you are due or you will come to understand the question program or solution better This is certainly a win win situation Please read the solution and assignment grades spreadsheet carefully before contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct answers Your TA will then re examine issue possibly asking you for more information if there is still confusion or arranging to talk to you If there is a difference your TA will email me a revised summary about your program and cc a copy to you I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate it might take a bit of time

class if you have a grading issue we will consider it only if you bring it to your TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials 3 1 5 15 First Lab You will need to use the lab computers to take two In Lab Programming Exams As part of your first day in lab students should check that they can log on to the ICS lab computers those students who took previous ICS courses which should be most of you should have these accounts already If you can log into these accounts you can use them If you cannot log into these accounts you should visit ICS 364 with your student ID during the lab to have them activate an account for you Activation may take a few days In the meantime you can work on your own computer or log onto the lab computers with the ID ics temp and the password Anteat3r yes a capital A and the number 3 When using Eclipse with this temporary account you must create a workspace on your desktop not the H drive otherwise all temporary users would be sharing that workspace 2 1 5 15 Install Course Software All students with computers should download and install the course Software Java to run Eclipse Python and Eclipse All three products are available for free on the internet Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software by following then Course Software link If you are using a Mac there are special instructions for you e g Java is already installed Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers in the UCI labs I expect students with computers to download and install this software by the end of the first week of the quarter If you are having difficulty with this task the TAs and Lab Tutors will help you during the first Lab meeting or beyond if necessary bring your computer to the lab if you have successfully downloaded and installed this software please help other students do so too Finally you can also use the class MessageBoard Forums to ask questions about this software and help other students 1 1 5 15 First Message Welcome to ICS 33 I am going to post and archive important messages about the class in this announcements web page each entry will be numbered dated and labeled The

width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #9: 1/30/15<br>\r\n  In-Lab Programming Exam #1 Graded\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI have graded In-Lab Programming Exam #1 and updated the main grades\r\n  spreadsheet.\r\nI changed the the way that I graded this exam from the published criteria.\r\nI dropped everyone's lowest score for one problem: so effectively you were\r\n  graded on writing 4 problems each worth 25 points.\r\nThe result of this grading change was that everyone's grade either stayed the\r\n  same (only if you scored a 0% or 100% using the original criteria) or\r\n  increased.\r\n<p>\r\nI believe the In-Lab Exams ar the best indicator, of all testing instruments, of\r\n  your ability to program.\r\nAs I'll say in class, Tolstoy is often quoted (from Anna Karenina) as writing,\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\nMy adaptation of this quote is\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\"High-scoring students are all alike (knowing how to program well); every\r\n  low-scoring student did poorly in his/her own way (lack of programming \r\n  ability, freezing on the exam, misunderstanding the problem statements,\r\n  spending too much time debugging one problem, being ill when taking the exam,\r\n  etc).\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nUsing the updated grading criteria, the class average was about 70% and the\r\n  median was about 83%; last quarter the class average was about 67% and\r\n  median was about 88%.\r\nBecause the average was below 75%, about 5 normalization points (5%) are\r\n  added-in for this problem when the average of all graded instruments is\r\n  computed.\r\nThe grades recorded in the spreadsheet are the actual exam grades; the final\r\n  % columns adds in the normalization points for all instruments (for now, all\r\n  are 0 except for In-Lab Exam #1).\r\n<p>\r\nA few students submitted functions with syntax errors; for these students I\r\n  deducted 2 points and I replaced the incorrect statement and all following\r\n  statements in the function body by <b>pass</b>: that function then failed all\r\n  its tests, but it allowed the automatic grading program to grade all the\r\n  other functions.\r\n<p>\r\nNotice the large skew between the Average (70%) and the Median (83%) scores:\r\n  half the students scored 88% (a high B+) but many students who scored lower\r\n  scored very poorly, dragging down the average.\r\nA total of 40% of the students scored 100% (in fact, even 30% scored 100% when\r\n  graded on all 5 problems), and 5% scored 0% (these students did not get any\r\n  functions to pass any of their batch self-check tests).\r\n<p>\r\nThe approximate distribution of grades on this In-Lab exam, after normalization,\r\n  is 43% As, 9% Bs, 10% Cs, 7% Ds, and 31% Fs (last quarter it was.\r\n  is 46% As, 6% Bs, 6% Cs, 6% Ds, and 36% Fs).\r\nThis U-shaped distribution (mostly As and Fs) is not uncommon on In-Lab\r\n  Programming Exams, where we are testing mastery of programming concepts.\r\n<p>\r\nExamine the <a href=\"solutions/ile1gradesstudents.zip\">assignment grades</a>, a\r\n   zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this\r\n   instrument: the columns show how many of the batch self-check tests failed.\r\nThese were similar to the tests that appeared in the driver of the file you\r\n  downloaded for the exam; but, all produce differents results, because some\r\n  students hard-code the answer into their functons: they just copy/paste the\r\n  correct answer returned for one of the problems, hoping to get some\r\n  correctness points.\r\nFinally, this file is sorted by unique ID.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, there were 9 students who scored less than 50 on the In-Lab exam, who\r\n  also scored over 90% on Programming Assignment #1.\r\nI'm concerned that these students let their partners do all the work and did\r\n  not understand the code that they submitted (whether they did so accidentally\r\n  or on purpose).\r\nBetween the points on the written and In-Lab exams, these students are unlikely\r\n  to pass the course; and if they do pass the course, they will be unprepared\r\n  for later programming courses (whether they use Python or not).\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table

might flunk this course (technically anything less than a C and you\r\n  cannot continue with other courses) and have to take it over; but most\r\n  students who flunk a course flunk it because they didn't learn what they\r\n  needed in the prerequisite course; if that is true you might take this course\r\n  multiple times and still flunk it, because your Python skills aren't what they\r\n  need to be.\r\nEven worse, if you squeak by and barely pass this course, you are now done with\r\n  a year of programming but haven't learned what you need to thrive in later\r\n  classes at UCI: this is really a worse outcome than flunking,\r\n  because it sets you up for failure further in your studies, when it is even\r\n  more difficult to get caught up.\r\nI'm happy to talk to students who feel

Eclipse Debugger perspective, and\r\n   batch-self-check files in the <b>driver.py</b> module (in <b>courselib</b>).\r\n It was also designed to see if you could follow instructions and ask\r\n    questions: more on that below.\r\n<p>\r\nThe class average was 29 (or about 95%) and the median was 30 (or about 100%).\r\nThere were 81% As, 7% Bs, 6% Cs, and 6% Ds and Fs of those student who turned\r\n  in any work.\r\nThe assignment was not meant to be hard, but it was not trivial either, and\r\n  there were many opportunities to lose points.\r\n<p>\r\nLet me talk about what will probably be the most contentious single point of\r\n  the 1,000 points that this course is worth (thus .1% of the grade): the point\r\n  was lost by 50 students (or about 29%).\r\nI took off 1 point if you corrected the misspelling <b>Inteprxter</b> (and\r\n  two points if you didn't have either spelling: in this second case you\r\n  obvious failed to meet the specifications because you did not print what was\r\n  required).\r\nWhen some students hear about this point deduction, their heads explode and\r\n  they cannot believe that I am taking off a point for correcting what you\r\n  probably thought was my mistake.\r\nBut... I am trying to foster an atmosphere where nothing is taken for granted in\r\n  the instructions I give: if anything seems confusing or plain wrong, I should\r\n  be questioned about it -preferably in public, so others can learn about the\r\n  problem and the correction.\r\nFor some background, check out my story about Mr. Lill in the course overview.\r\n<p>\r\nSome students did ask me outside of class if they should correct the\r\n  misspelling, and I told them \"no\"; some students asked me by email if they\r\n  should correct the misspelling, and I told them \"no\"; but no student asked on\r\n  the Forum whether they should have corrected the misspelling - if one did I\r\n  would have answered \"no\" there, for all students in the class to see.\r\nIt is critical for programmers to be sure they know the specifications of the\r\n  problem they are being asked to solve, otherwise they will solve, test, debug\r\n  document, etc. the problem incorrectly, and another cycle of development will\r\n  be needed to fix the misconceptions.\r\nThe overview lecture included a graph that showed that the later in development\r\n  a problem is found, the harder/more expensive it is to fix.\r\nSo if we can find problems at  the time we are reading the specification of the\r\n  problem to solve, that can save us a lot of work/money later.\r\n<p>\r\nThe bottom line is that you are responsible for reading the instructions\r\n  carefully and reporting any confusion so that I can clear it up (best reported\r\n  on the MessageBoard Forum for Programming Assignments).\r\nOf course, you can freely talk to anyone about the problem specifications, just\r\n  not the code that you write for your solutions.\r\nIf you make any assumptions (like the node names in Programming Assignment #1\r\n  always being one letter long -that is not part of the specification), they\r\n  might come back later to haunt you (gradewise).\r\nWhen working with a partner, you'll have two eyes reading the specification.\r\nI am willing to deduct this painful point at the start of the quarter, from many\r\n  students, to get across this perspective.\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, some students did not carefully read the instructions in the Debugger\r\n  Perspective document for the quiz part, which required them to change a line\r\n  in the <b>craps</b> script before running it with the debugger to gather the\r\n  required information.\r\nWith this change in your program, you can find the answers we need to check;\r\n  without it, you cannot.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, 59 students (35%) submitted the program 2 or more days early; 39\r\n  students (23%) submitted the program 1 day early.\r\nKeep up the good work: you can earn 12 points if you turn in every Programming\r\n  Assignment 2 days early.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMPORTANT</b>\r\nIf you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please\r\n  contact your TA first (see above) and tell him/her what you think the\r\n  differences are.\r\nSuch a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he will agree with you\r\n that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the credit\r\n that you are due), or you will come to understand the question, program, or\r\n  solution better.\r\nThis is certainly a win-win situation.\r\nPlease read the solution and <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully\r\n  <b>before</b> contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct\r\n  answers.\r\nYour TA will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more information if\r\n  there is still confusion, or arranging to talk to you.\r\nIf there is a difference, your TA will email me a revised summary about your\r\n  program, and cc a copy to you.\r\nI will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of\r\n  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).\r\n<p>\r\nIf you feel there is still a problem after talking to your TA, please contact me\r\n (but always contact your TA first).\r\nAlso, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, we will\r\n  consider it only if you bring it to\r\n  your <b>TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials</b>.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #3: 1/5/15<br>\r\n  First Lab\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  You will need to use the lab computers to take two In-Lab Programming Exams.\r\n  As part of your first day in lab, students should check that they can log on\r\n    to the ICS lab computers: those students who took previous ICS courses\r\n    (which should be most of you) should have these accounts already.\r\n  If you can log into these accounts, you can use them.\r\n  <p>\r\n  If you cannot log into these accounts, you should visit ICS-364 with your\r\n     student ID during the lab, to have them activate an account for you.\r\n  Activation may take a few days.\r\n  In the meantime, you can work on your own computer or log onto the lab\r\n    computers with the ID <b>ics-temp</b> and the password <b>Anteat3r</b>\r\n   (yes, a capital <b>A</b> and the number <b>3</b>).\r\n  When using Eclipse with this temporary account, you must create a workspace on\r\n    your desktop, not the <b>H</b> drive (otherwise all temporary users would be\r\n    sharing that workspace).\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #2: 1/5/15<br>\r\n  Install Course Software\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  All students with computers should download and install the course Software:\r\n    Java (to run Eclipse), Python, and Eclipse.\r\n  All three products are available for free on the internet.\r\n  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software\r\n    by following then\r\n    <a href=\"../common/online.html\" target=\"main\">Course Software</a>\r\n    link.\r\n  If you are using a Mac there are special instructions for you\r\n    (e.g., Java is already installed)\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers\r\n    in the UCI labs, I expect students with computers to download and install\r\n    this software by the end of the first week of the quarter.\r\n  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help\r\n    you during the first Lab meeting (or beyond, if necessary: bring your\r\n    computer to the lab);
