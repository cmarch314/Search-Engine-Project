last Friday night Fabio Vitali after giving an excellent overview of all proposals for describing the particular version of a resource within a URL then started defending name space munging On the other hand http host dir projectX 1 5 Macintosh French file c http host dir projectX file c 1 5 Macintosh French http host dir projectX French Macintosh 1 5 file c http host dir projectX French Macintosh 1 5 file c george http host dir projectX French Macintosh 1 5 file c draft 2 1 are all non ambiguous and may well refer to exactly the same resource Hey I think it is even possible to simply use the file system for them Adding specific semantics to the name space is a bad idea for the following reasons 1 Legacy problem Existing sites containing hundreds of thousands of pages the current size of many large corporation intranets will be completely unwilling to change their existing name space to gain the advantages of versioning This is because they would be required to rewrite the destination URL of all anchors to versioned documents For example A HREF http foo bar com top middle doc html would need to be changed to A HREF http foo bar com top middle 1 5 doc html In thousands of documents This then provides a powerful disincentive for the adoption of our versioning technology by the groups who would most benefit In contrast the version version id or version version id schemes do not modify the name space and hence would not require modification of existing documents 2 Competing name space semantics What gives us the right to partition the name space for HTTP servers which employ versioning How can we guarantee that our partitioning of the name space will not contain collisions with other name space partitionings required by other technologies present or future We cannot In fact this particular partitioning of the name space already collides with existing naming practice of many public domain Unix tools and for this reason alone concerns me This was also discussed by David Fiander in a previous post Unfortunately neither option addresses the practical concern that the server has to have some way of determining strong when a URL contains a version I mean the path http host foo 1 5 bar html could easily reference a page discussing the history of the bar facility in Lisp 1 5 3 It is impossible for a HTTP user agent or for a human being to determine whether a directory named 1 5 is an actual physical directory or a version number without querying the HTTP server It is extremely useful for a user to know just by looking at a URL whether a resource is a particular version Allowing arbitrary opaque identifiers one area on which we do have consensus for version names makes matters even more confusing in http foo bar com src alpha foo c html is alpha a version name for the alpha release of the code or is it the name of the directory containing code for the DEC Alpha 4 The main benefit of placing version identifiers into the name space surfing into the past via relative URLs does not work One scenario outlines this http foo bar com 1 5 A html where 1 5 is the version id contains a relative URL of GIF background gif In this case version 1 5 of background gif would also be retrieved However experience to date with versioning systems shows that all objects are not versioned at the same rate Thus it is much more likely that version 1 1 or some other arbitrary version of the GIF is what really needed to be retrieved OK so the relative URL could be changed to 1 1 background gif but then what has been gained over http foo bar com 1 1 background gif Jim Whitehead ejw ics uci edu Next message Larry Masinter Re Re2 what s doable in Web version control Previous message Fabio Vitali Re Version identifier in URL Next in
