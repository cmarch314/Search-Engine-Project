A key observation is that, in a scalable system, the number of\nheap objects representing data items cannot grow proportionally with the\ndataset cardinality. We develop Facade, a Java-based compiler and <span\nclass=GramE>runtime, that</span> can statically bound the number of heap\nobjects that represent data items. Facade advocates <span class=GramE>to store\ndata items in native memory and create</span> objects as facades to represent\ndata items. It uses a new execution model that dynamically establishes a\nmany-to-one mapping between an unbounded set of data items in native memory and\na statically bounded set of objects in the heap, thereby reducing significantly\nthe number of objects, their associated space overhead (i.e., pointers and\nheaders), as well as the GC cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.0in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;\ntext-autospace:none'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\ncolor:black'> The paper is accepted by ASPLOS'15. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\ncolor:black'> <b>2 GraphQ: Semantics-aware graph simplification<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.0in'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\";color:black;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Real-world graphs\n(such as the Yahoo <span class=SpellE>webgraph</span> and the twitter graph)\nare extremely large and often need a cluster of machines to process. To support\nefficient test and debugging, it is important to generate, from real-world\ngraphs, a small subset of vertices and edges that retain interesting properties\nin the original graphs. Existing techniques focused primarily on graph sampling\nthat uses statistical methods to sample a large graph so that the generated\ngraph follows the same distribution. However, all of these techniques are\nsemantics-agnostic, meaning that they prune graph without considering what each\napplication is interested in. For example, page rank is interested in edge\ndensity while maximal clique cares more about the sizes of the cliques in the\ngraph. We are in the process of developing novel algorithms that intelligently\nprune a graph based on the user's specifications of interesting properties.\n <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.0in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;\ntext-autospace:none'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\ncolor:black'> The paper is under submission. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background-color:#B22222\">Publications &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span></h1>\n<li><b>1</b> Khanh Nguyen,<b> Kai Wang</b>, Yingyi Bu, Lu Fang, Jianfei Hu, and Guoqing Xu. \"Facade: A Compiler and Runtime for (Almost) Object-Bounded Big Data Applications\", 20th International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), Istanbul, Turkey, March 14-18, 2015.
