CACTI\nis a micro-architecture level tool widely used\n(i) to estimate power dissipation in caches and (ii) to determine\nthe cache configuration that best meets the desired optimization\ncriterion. However,\nwe observed several limitations in CACTI that lead to\ninaccuracies in cache power estimates especially as we move to\ndeep sub-micron (DSM) technologies: a) lack of models to account for\nleakage power, b) use of constant gate widths for most devices\nirrespective of its capacitive load, and c) lack of models to\naccount for power dissipation in sub-blocks that are outside the time\ncritical path. As a result, the cache configuration determined by CACTI may not\nbe optimal because of these limitations. Our tool, <em> <I> eCACTI </I> </em>\n(enhanced CACTI),\naddresses these limitations in CACTI thereby improving the\naccuracy of its power estimates. We validated <I> eCACTI</I> power estimates\nagainst SPICE based simulations on industrial designs. Furthermore,\nwe show that for DSM technologies, CACTI does not generate\npower optimal cache configuration, which highlights the need for\nthe enhancements we developed in <I> eCACTI </I>.\nFinally, we demonstrate the use of <I> eCACTI </I> to study the effects of\n(i) technology on cache leakage and total cache power,\n(ii) dual-Vth optimization on sub-block and total cache leakage power,\n(iii) effects of varying cache size, block size, and associativity\nfor DSM technologies.\n<EM>\n<HR>\n<I>Technical report available in</I>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~maheshmn/eCACTI/ecacti_tr.ps\">ps</A>\nor <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~maheshmn/eCACTI/ecacti_tr.pdf\">pdf</A>\n<br><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~maheshmn/eCACTI/download.htm\">eCACTI software download page</a>\n<BR>\n<center><!--msthemeseparator--><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"_themes/poetic/poehorsa.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"10\"></p>\n<p><small>\n&nbsp;Copyright University of California, Irvine, 2004.<br>\nFor problems or questions regarding this web, contact <i>\n<a href=\"mailto:maheshmn@cecs.uci.edu\">Mahesh Mamidipaka</a></i>.<br>\nLast updated: 10/06/04.&nbsp;\n</small></p>\n</center>\n<!--mstheme--></font></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>\n\n</html>", "id": 8331.0}
