Reflections of the Journey to Software Process Maturity George Yamamura Information Space and Defense Systems The Boeing Company george yamamura boeing com We can all remember when embedded software development was a major problem area for many large integrated systems Tiger teams fire fighting and audits were common everyday activities Within the Boeing Space Transportation Systems STS organization we institutionalized a smooth running software development team using well defined processes and trained employees I would like to share thoughts and insights that helped bring about this transition The first is that we approached process improvement in response to our business goals Secondly we acknowledged process improvement is a human issue Hear how we developed a management goal framework as a road map for the business case Also hear how we implemented a simple four step formula for success to address the human aspects of cultural change This formula applied to software development resulted in dramatic improvements and excellent performance for STS Biography George Yamamura is the Software Engineering Process Manager of Boeing Information Space Defense Systems ISDS in Seattle Washington He supports ISDS programs and deployment of best practices Previous to that he managed the STS software development and its effort that led to an SEI CMM Level 5 rating He has 3 years of software experience in the space application field He has bachelor s and master s degrees in Aeronautics Astronautics from the University of Washington and a master s degree in Applied Math from the University of Santa Clara Challenges to Software Process Maturity Gary B Wigle Associate Technical Fellow Information Space and Defense Systems The Boeing Company gary b wigle boeing com The road to successful process improvement requires a clear understanding of the challenges ahead for the Software Engineering Process Group SEPG Many organizations believe the effort will be straightforward and too often view it in mechanical terms without addressing the unique problems to be encountered We have identified sixteen areas that can provide unique challenges for the SEPG We have grouped these challenges into three areas with the first group of challenges being those related to people issues Consistent with our philosophy we view process improvement first and foremost as a human issue The second group of challenges is related to processes and the third group of challenges focuses on problems related to process assets Biography Gary Wigle is the Associate Technical Fellow for software processes in Boeing s ISDS in Seattle Washington He has more than twenty five years of experience in embedded software applications both in the Air Force and at Boeing He was the
