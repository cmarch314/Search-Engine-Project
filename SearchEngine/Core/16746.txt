Information and Computer Science DEGREES AVAILABLE Major and Minor The overall field of information and computer science spans a vast spectrum of topics The degree in Information and Computer Science is an individually designed degree Students must submit a proposal for a four year plan of study along with a rationale for why the proposed plan is a well motivated set of courses that does not fit into any of the existing ICS majors Students submitting proposals are strongly encouraged to follow the lower division requirements for one of the Bren School majors or provide a rationale for why this is not appropriate and should include at least 48 units of upper division ICS Computer Science Informatics or Statistics courses Proposals must be approved by the ICS Associate Dean for Student Affairs Is Information and Computer Science for me What do I take What can I do with this degree Special Programs and Learning Opportunities Still not sure Is Information and Computer Science for me The Information and Computer Science major is intended for highly motivated students who are currently enrolled at UCI who find that their academic and career interests are not well served by any of the existing ICS majors and would be better served by a uniquely designed course of study Back to top What do I take Back to top What can I do with this degree Graduates of the Information and Computer Science major pursue a broad variety of careers Since students have maximum flexibility in selecting their courses they may choose to take any set of courses that best aligns with their career goals Upon completing their degree our students have been hired at Pixar IBM Yahoo NASA Microsoft Google Deloitte Unisys Accenture Merrill Lynch Blizzard Broadcom and many other world renowned organizations Many students also go on to graduate school continuing their studies conducting research and earning graduate degrees in computer engineering computer science information science management or law Back to top Special Programs and Learning Opportunities There are several ways to add depth scope and experiential learning to your academic program of study An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major minor or concentration to your academic plan and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals CONCENTRATIONS Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus followed by a technology related internship in the host country Application Each student s proposed program of study specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U S must be approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student Affairs It is expected that each student s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection as well as considerations related to internship opportunities housing and financial aid The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan as needed Requirements A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture language if applicable and necessary history literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program international law international labor policy global issues global institutions global conflict and negotiation and global economics A one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and possibly cultural history and literature courses taken at an international university A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience MINORS Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue a minor a coordinated set of courses which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field subject and or discipline Note Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the student s major requirements Some major minor combinations are not allowed Biomedical Computing 1 courses Digital Information Systems 7 courses Informatics 8 courses Information and Computer Science 7 courses Statistics 7 courses OPPORTUNITIES FOR HONORS LEVEL STUDY Students who are

An academic counselor will \nhelp you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor, \nor concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other \ncampus programs and resources that support your interests and future \ngoals.\n\t\t\t  </p>\n<p><strong><span><strong>&#187;</strong></span> CONCENTRATIONS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<br/>\n<li><strong>Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context</strong><br/>\n \n<i><br/>\nAll Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan \nthat demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other \nrequirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.</i>\n<p>\nThe globalization of the marketplace for information technology services\n and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in \nmulticultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive \ninternational operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the \nconcentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the\n history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside\n the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international \nhost campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host \ncountry.\n</p>\n<strong>Application:</strong><br/>\nEach student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a \nguided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be \napproved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student\n Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a \nhigh degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic \ncounselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education \nregarding course selection, as well as considerations related to \ninternship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic \ncounselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified \nstudents with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as \nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Requirements:</strong><br/> \n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li><span>A\n minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an \nemphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), \nhistory, literature of the country that corresponds to the international\n portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, \nglobal issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation and \nglobal economics; </span></li>\n<li><span>A\n one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major \nand, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken at an \ninternational university;</span></li>\n<li><span>A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span><strong>&#187;</strong></span> MINORS</strong>\n<p>\nStudents inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue\n a minor, a coordinated set of courses which together take a student \nwell beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or\n discipline.  Note:  Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the \nstudent&#8217;s major requirements.
