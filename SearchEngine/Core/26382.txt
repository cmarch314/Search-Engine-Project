{"text": "Basic Animation Exercise Now that you have learned how to model shade and light objects in Maya it is time for you to learn how to make these objects move Before continuing this exercise download and open ball ma a scene containing a simple ball We generally animate in 3 frames per second so click the Animation Preferences button go to the Settings category and make sure Time is set to NTSC 3 fps Also for the purpose of this exercise in Animation Preferences go to the Animation category then set Default in tangent to Clamped and Default out tangent to Stepped The Timeline Placed directly below the viewport the timeline is the most visible animation tool in Maya Though relatively simple it is extremely useful You can think of it as a summary of your animation The dark gray bar is called the time slider Its position represents the scene s current animation frame information also indicated by the value on the right To change the slider s position simply left click anywhere on the timeline You can also scrub the slider across the timeline by left clicking and dragging the mouse left and right Below the timeline are the range values The two outtermost numbers 1 6 are the start and end times of the entire animation while the inner numbers 1 3 designate the part of our animation that the timeline shows Essentially the timeline is just a window into the overall animation of the scene To move this window you can manipulate the gray bar inbetween the range values Left click and drag the center of the bar to move it around or drag one of the two small boxes to resize it You can also just edit the values manually To the right of the timeline are the playback controls Click or to play the time slider either backwards or forwards respectively You can alter the playback options by right clicking on the timeline and choosing Playback Speed Real time or Play Every Frame For now make sure that the playback speed is set to Real time as it is the best approximation of your animation s timing whereas the timing of Play Every Frame is variable Click or to send the time slider to the beginning or the end of the playback range and or to step the time slider back or forward one frame Keyframes Maya uses keyframes for animation we also refer to them in short as keys A keyframe is basically a marker used to specify an object s position and attributes at a given point in time To set a keyframe on the ball at the current frame select the ball and go to Animate Set Key or just hit s A red tick mark should appear on the timeline near the slider indicating that you have keyed the ball on the current frame You may also notice that the attributes in the Channel Box have turned pink an indication that the object has been keyed The Channel Box s role in keyframing will be explained in further detail a little later Try setting another keyframe Move the time slider to a different frame and use the translate tool to alter the ball s position before keying After you set the key scrub the time slider back and forth across the timeline The ball should switch between its old and new positions Note that the keyframes are probably set to stepped mode which means that a keyframe will stay in effect until the next key is reached Alternative modes of keyframe interpolation will be discussed in the Graph Editor Exercise For the sake of testing create several more keys randomly along the timeline Note that the timeline will only display keyframes of the object you have selected If you deselect the ball the keys will disappear from the timeline until you reselect it Conversely if you selected more than one animated object the keyframes of all the combined objects would be displayed on the timeline This is something to keep in mind as in that situation it may be difficult to tell which key belongs to which object and how many keyframes a single red tick may represent If you want to move quickly between the keyframes currently displayed click or on the playback controls or just use your keyboard s carrot keys comma and period To change the ball s position on an existing key shift the time slider back to the appropriate frame move the ball to the desired location and set the key again thus replacing the key s previous values Always remember that you must set the key again to save your object s new position If you do not moving the time slider will discard your changes That is unless you enable autokey Autokey automatically saves the changes you make to an object s keyframes If the current frame already has a key autokey will immediately update the key with your changes If the current frame does not have a key autokey will automatically create a keyframe based on your adjustments this only works on objects with existing keys However be aware that with autokey it is easy to accidently create stray keys on the timeline or make changes you did not intend Though it is recommended you do not use autokey before fully familiarizing yourself with the animation workflow you can enable it by clicking the icon below the playback settings It will appear as once turned on To delete a key move the slider to the offending frame right click on the timeline and select Delete Sometimes you will want to delete or move a group of keys all at once To accomplish this you first need to select a portion of the timeline Hold down shift then left click drag over the keys you want to work with The selection should look something like this To move this group of keys simply left click the center arrows and drag You can also scale the group a quick way to speed up or slow down an animation by moving the selection s outter arrows Be careful when scaling keys though as you will end up with keys on that are on fractions of frames In general you never want keys on fractions of frames as they tend to get in the way and are more difficult to work with The easiest way fix to this problem is to select the keys call up the right click menu and choose Snap This will snap each key to the closest whole frame number Channel Box As pointed out before keying the ball will cause all of its attributes in the Channel Box to turn pink However it is important to note that the ball itself is not being keyed Its attributes are When you hit s to set a keyframe on an object you are actually setting a key for each individual attribute usually each attribute visible in the Channel Box One implication of this is that you can key a single attribute Go ahead and delete all of the ball s keyframes You can either do this through the timeline or you can select all of the attributes in the Channel Box left click Translate X and drag down to Visibility call up the right click menu and choose Delete Selected The attributes should turn dark gray signifying they no longer have keyframes on them Right click on any attribute and choose Key Selected Just like the Set Key operation it will create a key on the current frame but now only for the selected attribute You can also make a particular attribute Non keyable which prevents it from being affected by Set Key For example this is particularly useful for the Visibility attribute as most of the time you do not want to worry about accidently animating it on and off To make an attribute Non keyable right click it and choose Make Selected Nonkeyable Its value should turn the same color as the surrounding channel box as shown below If the attribute had existing keyframes they will still be there however you will not be able to edit them If the attribute had no keys you can edit it as a constant value but it cannot be keyed You can make the attribute keyable again at any time by choosing Make Selected Keyable Playblasting Once you have a number of keyframes you will want to review your motion Playblasts are Maya s way of creating a preview of your animation that runs in real time and is much faster to create than a render Go to Window Playblast options Change the Display size to Custom and enter 64 and 48 for the two values Change the scale to 1 and check Save to File and name it appropriately If you do not specify a save path Maya will output it to your current project directory When playblasting character motion that somebody else is going to review for both turn in and production you will want to take extra care to make a clean playblast In the playblast options uncheck Show ornaments Make sure the camera is a reasonable distance from your animated object character It shouldn t be so far away that you can barely see the motion but it also shouldn t be so close up that part of it gets cut off Also if there are any animation controls lights locators etc cluttering the scene you will want to hide those An easy way to do this temporarily is to go the viewport you are going to playblast from then select Show None After that select Show Polygons as animated characters are usually polygonal Now that you have learned about keyframing how to use the timeline and how to preview your animation with playblasts you will need to review the Graph Editor Exercise to learn about splining your keyframes Back to

Exercise</h1></center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow that you have learned how to model, shade, and light objects in Maya, it is time for you to learn how to make\r\nthese objects move.  Before continuing this exercise, download and open <a href=\"../maya_files/ball.ma\">ball.ma</a>, a scene containing a simple ball.  We generally\r\nanimate in 30 frames per second, so click the Animation Preferences button (<img style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" src=\"images/animation/prefs.png\">), go to the Settings category, and make\r\nsure <i>Time</i> is set to <b>NTSC (30 fps)</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, for the purpose of this exercise, in Animation Preferences go to the Animation category then set <i>Default in tangent</i> to <b>Clamped</b>\r\nand <i>Default out tangent</i> to <b>Stepped</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Timeline</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPlaced directly below the viewport, the timeline is the most visible animation tool in Maya.  Though relatively simple it is extremely useful.\r\nYou can think of it as a summary of your animation.\r\nThe dark gray bar is called the time slider.  Its position represents the scene's current animation frame, information also indicated by the value\r\non the right. To change the slider's position, simply left click anywhere on the timeline.\r\nYou can also \"scrub\" the slider across the timeline by left clicking and dragging the mouse left and right.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/timeline.png\"/></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBelow the timeline are the range values.\r\nThe two outtermost numbers (<b>1.00</b>, <b>60.00</b>) are the start and end times of the entire animation, while the inner numbers (<b>1.00</b>, <b>30.00</b>)\r\ndesignate the part of our animation that the timeline shows.  Essentially, the timeline is just a window into the overall animation of the scene.\r\nTo move this window, you can manipulate the gray bar inbetween the range values.  Left click and drag the center of the bar to move it around, or drag \r\none of the two small boxes to resize it.  You can also just edit the values manually.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/range.png\"/></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo the right of the timeline are the playback controls.  Click <img src=\"images/animation/playback_rewind.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\">\r\nor <img src=\"images/animation/playback_play.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\"> to play the time slider either backwards or forwards respectively.\r\nYou can alter the playback options by right clicking on the timeline and choosing <b>Playback Speed &rarr; Real-time</b> or <b>Play Every Frame</b>.\r\nFor now make sure that the playback speed is set to <b>Real-time</b>, as it is the best approximation of your animation's timing, whereas\r\nthe timing of <b>Play Every Frame</b> is variable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClick <img src=\"images/animation/playback_start.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\"> or <img src=\"images/animation/playback_end.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\">\r\nto send the time slider to the beginning or the end of the playback range, and \r\n<img src=\"images/animation/playback_step_back_frame.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\">\r\nor <img src=\"images/animation/playback_step_forward_frame.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\">\r\nto step the time slider back or forward one frame.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/playback.png\"/></center>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keyframes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMaya uses \"keyframes\" for animation (we also refer to them in short as \"keys\").  A keyframe is basically a marker used to specify an object's position\r\nand attributes at a given point in time. To set a keyframe on the ball at the current frame, select the ball and go to <b>Animate &rarr; Set Key</b>\r\n(or just hit <b>s</b>).  A red tick mark should appear on the timeline near the slider, indicating that you have \"keyed\" the ball on the current frame.\r\nYou may also notice that the attributes in the Channel Box have turned pink, an indication that the object has been keyed.  The Channel Box's role\r\nin keyframing will be explained in further detail a little later.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTry setting another keyframe.  Move the time slider to a different frame and use the translate tool to alter the ball's position before keying.\r\nAfter you set the key, scrub the time slider back and forth across the timeline.  The ball should switch between its old and new positions.  Note that\r\nthe keyframes are probably set to \"stepped\" mode, which means that a keyframe will stay in effect until the next key is reached.\r\n(Alternative modes of keyframe interpolation will be discussed in the <a href=\"graph_editor_exercise.html\">Graph Editor Exercise</a>.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor the sake of testing, create several more keys randomly along the timeline:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/keys_multiple.png\"/></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNote that the timeline will only display keyframes of the object you have selected.  If you deselect the ball, the keys will \r\ndisappear from the timeline until you reselect it.  Conversely, if you selected more than one animated object, the keyframes of all the combined objects would \r\nbe displayed on the timeline.  This is something to keep in mind, as in that situation it may be difficult to tell which key \r\nbelongs to which object and how many keyframes a single red tick may represent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you want to move quickly between the keyframes currently displayed, click <img src=\"images/animation/playback_step_back_key.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\"> or\r\n<img src=\"images/animation/playback_step_forward_key.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\"> on the playback controls, or just use your keyboard's \"carrot\" keys (comma and period).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo change the ball's position on an existing key, shift the time slider back to the appropriate\r\nframe, move the ball to the desired location, and set the key again - thus replacing the key's previous values.\r\nAlways remember that you must set the key again to save your object's new position.  If you do not, moving the time slider will discard your changes.\r\nThat is, unless you enable autokey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAutokey automatically saves the changes you make to an object's keyframes.  If the current frame already has a key, autokey \r\nwill immediately update the key with your changes. If the current frame does not have a key, autokey will automatically create \r\na keyframe based on your adjustments (this only works on objects with existing keys).\r\nHowever, be aware that with autokey it is easy to accidently create stray keys on the timeline or make changes you did not intend.  Though it is recommended you \r\ndo not use autokey before fully familiarizing yourself with the animation workflow, you can enable it by clicking the\r\n<img src=\"images/animation/autokey_off.png\"> icon below the playback settings.\r\nIt will appear as <img src=\"images/animation/autokey_on.png\"> once turned on.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo delete a key, move the slider to the offending frame, right click on the timeline and select <b>Delete</b>.\r\nSometimes you will want to delete or move a group of keys all at once.  To accomplish this, you first need to select a portion of the timeline.\r\nHold down shift then left click drag over the keys you want to work with.  The selection should look something like this:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/keys_selected.png\"/></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo move this group of keys simply left click the center arrows and drag.  You can also scale the group, a quick\r\nway to speed up or slow down an animation, by moving the selection's outter arrows.\r\nBe careful when scaling keys, though; as you will end up with keys on that are on fractions of frames:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/keys_partial.png\"/></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn general you never want keys on fractions of frames as they tend to get in the way and are more difficult to work with.\r\nThe easiest way fix to this problem is to select the keys, call up the right click menu, and choose <b>Snap</b>.  This will snap each key\r\nto the closest whole frame number.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Channel Box</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs pointed out before, keying the ball will cause all of its attributes in  the Channel Box to turn pink.  However, it is important to note that\r\nthe ball itself is not being keyed.  Its attributes are.  When you hit <b>s</b> to set a keyframe on an object, you are actually\r\nsetting a key for each individual attribute (usually each attribute visible in the Channel Box).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/cb_keyed.png\"></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne implication of this is that you can key a single attribute.  Go ahead and delete all of the ball's keyframes.  You can either do this through\r\nthe timeline, or you can select all of the attributes in the Channel Box (left click  <i>Translate X</i> and drag down to <i>Visibility</i>),\r\ncall up the right click menu, and choose <b>Delete Selected</b>. The attributes should turn dark gray, signifying they no longer have keyframes on them.\r\nRight click on any attribute and choose <b>Key Selected</b>.\r\nJust like the Set Key operation it will create a key on the current frame, but now only for the selected attribute:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/cb_single_keyed.png\"></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can also make a particular attribute \"Non-keyable\", which prevents it from being affected by Set Key.\r\nFor example, this is particularly useful for the Visibility attribute, as most of the time you do not want to worry about accidently animating it on and off.\r\nTo make an attribute Non-keyable  right click it and choose <b>Make Selected Nonkeyable</b>.  Its value should turn the same color as the surrounding channel box as shown below.\r\nIf the attribute had existing keyframes they will still\r\nbe there, however you will not be able to edit them.  If the attribute had no keys, you can edit it as a constant value but it cannot be keyed.\r\nYou can make the attribute keyable again at any time by choosing <b>Make Selected Keyable</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/animation/cb_non_keyable.png\"></center>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Playblasting</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce you have a number of keyframes you will want to review your motion.\r\nPlayblasts are Maya's way of creating a preview of your animation that runs in real time and is much faster to create than a render.\r\nGo to <b>Window &rarr; Playblast</b> options. Change the Display size to \"Custom\" and enter \r\n640 and 480 for the two values. Change the scale to \"1.00\", and check \"Save to File\" and name it appropriately. If you do not specify a save path, Maya will output it to your current project directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen playblasting character motion that somebody else is going to review (for both turn-in and production), you will want to take extra\r\ncare to make a \"clean\" playblast.  In the playblast options uncheck <strong>Show ornaments</strong>.  Make sure the camera is a reasonable distance from your animated object/character.\r\nIt shouldn't be so far away that you can barely see the motion, but it also shouldn't be so close-up that part of it gets cut off.  Also, if there\r\nare any animation controls, lights, locators, etc. cluttering the scene you will want to hide those.  An easy way to do this temporarily is to go the\r\nviewport you are going to playblast from, then select <b>Show &rarr; None</b>.  After that, select <b>Show &rarr; Polygons</b> (as animated characters are usually\r\npolygonal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow that you have learned about keyframing, how to use the timeline, and how to preview your animation with playblasts you will need to review the\r\n<a href=\"graph_editor_exercise.html\">Graph Editor Exercise</a> to learn about \"splining\" your keyframes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center><a class=\"large\" href=\"exercises.html\">Back to Exercises</a></center>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "id": 26382.0}
