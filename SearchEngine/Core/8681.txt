The virtue of\r\n    \t  the AND/OR representation of the search space is that its size may be far\r\n    \t  smaller than that of a traditional OR representation, which can translate into\r\n    \t  significant time savings for search algorithms. The focus of this paper is\r\n    \t  on linear space search which explores the AND/OR search tree rather than\r\n    \t  the search graph and therefore make no attempt to cache information.\r\n    \t  We investigate the power of the mini-bucket heuristics within the AND/OR\r\n    \t  search space, in both static and dynamic setups. We focus on two most\r\n    \t  common optimization problems in graphical models: finding the Most\r\n    \t  Probable Explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks and solving Weighted\r\n    \t  CSPs (WCSP). In extensive empirical evaluations we demonstrate that the\r\n    \t  new AND/OR Branch-and-Bound approach improves considerably over the\r\n    \t  traditional OR search strategy and show how various variable ordering\r\n    \t  schemes impact the performance of the AND/OR search scheme.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r151a.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8681.0}
