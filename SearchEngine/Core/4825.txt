Recently the problem of Web People Search (WePS) has attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia. In the classic formulation of WePS problem the user issues a query to a web search engine that consists of a name of a person of interest. For such a query, a traditional search engine such as Yahoo or Google would return webpages that are related to {\\em any} people who happened to have the queried name. The goal of WePS, instead, is to output a set of clusters of webpages, one cluster per each distinct person, containing all of the webpages related to that person. The user then can locate the desired cluster and explore the webpages it contains... \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Categories and Subject Descriptors:</H3>\r\nH.2.m [<B>Database Management</B>]: Miscellaneous - Web People Search;<BR>\r\nH.2.8 [<B>Database Management</B>]: Database Applications - Data mining;<BR>\r\nH.3.3 [<B>Information Storage and Retrieval</B>]: Information Search and Retrieval<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3>\r\nWeb People Search, WEPS, clustering,\r\nSkyline Based Classifier,\r\nWeb co-occurrence,\r\nEntity Resolution,\r\nDisambiguation\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/ICDE09_dvk_WEST.pdf\">ICDE09_dvk_WEST.pdf</A><BR>\r\nPresentation: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/ICDE09_dvk_WEST.ppt\">ICDE09_dvk_WEST.ppt</A><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?ICDE09_dvk_WEST\" width=1 height=1>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{ICDE09::dvk_demo,\r\n   author    = {Dmitri V.
