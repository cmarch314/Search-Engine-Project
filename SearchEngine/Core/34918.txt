Chemical ID Molecular Descriptors Sources Vendors Include Source External IDs Results Limit Text SearchSearch FieldTop Select which source vendor annotation field to perform a text search on Options include Chemical name Any field representing the name of the chemical systematic or common For example find tylenol or acetaminophen or serine or 2 amino 3 hydroxy propanoic acid External ID The ID number string that the source refers to the chemical as For example you could input a CAS registry number or PubChem Substance ID here and most likely the respective chemical will be found All annotations Searches through all of the annotations values including names IDs and any other descriptors the sources provide about their chemicals Search TextTop Full text search of source vendor annotations such as chemical names systematic and common Powered by the Lucene simple search module allowing for respective special command characters The search is case insensitive and should automatically separate out word components by spaces and punctuation marks Fuzzy MatchTop If you are unsure of the spelling for a chemical name enter your best guess and select the fuzzy style search option This will not only find chemicals with exactly matching name components but those which are similar to the search name Structure SearchSMILESTop Search for chemicals in the ChemDB with similar structure to a query structure by entering a SMILES string representing the query structure here Enter multiple SMILES strings one per line to perform a profile based concensus search which searches for items similar to every structure listed Especially useful when combined with the sub structure search option to search for chemicals containing several desired functional groups To sketch a structure instead of specifying a SMILES string click on the sketch icon To convert various molecular file formats into SMILES try the online Babel tool For more information on the de facto standard SMILES string representation spend a few minutes with the Daylight SMILES Tutorial Tversky ParametersTop When performing a similarity search additional parameters besides the query structure s may be specified to fine tune the query In particular the and parameters of the Tversky similarity measure may be used to fine tune the search towards a super structure or sub structure search For most basic needs just use the drop list to select either a Similar or Sub structure style search which will set reasonable default values for the and parameters The sub structure search option is especially useful for finding chemicals which possess the query structure as a sub structure functional group For more detailed information on how to use the and parameters refer to the Daylight Tversky Index Description Strict SubstructureTop While the similarity and parameters can be used to bias towards a sub structure search they may still yield some false positives That is structures which have something very similar to the search structures as sub structures but not exactly In combination with substructure biasing and parameters select this option to enforce strict substructure searching Any results returned must have the exact search structures as substructures not just something similar Similarity ThresholdTop Minimum similarity score that any search results must satisfy for similarity searches Value should be between and 1 This value is necessary to enable fast similarity searches A full search used to be supported which would not use such a threshold scanning the entire database for similar molecules This allowed for the calculation of additional statistics such as a z score for each result and a similarity distribution histogram and However this method would take 3 seconds per search and has thus since been disabled Basic FiltersSMILES CDB Chemical IDTop Search for chemicals having a specific SMILES string or CDB Chemical IDs by selecting one of these from the drop list CDB Chemical ID is the numerical identifier used in the ChemDB system to specify every unique chemical Enter one or more SMILES strings or CDB Chemical IDs but not both into the text box one item per line Only chemicals which exactly match one of these values will appear in the results To sketch a chemical structure instead of specifying a SMILES string click on the sketch icon To convert various molecular file formats into SMILES try the online Babel tool For more information on the de facto standard SMILES string representation spend 15 minutes with the Daylight SMILES Tutorial When searching for chemicals by exact SMILES as opposed to the similarity search the match must be exact with what is stored in the database The database only stores the canonical SMILES OEChem implementation for each chemical thus arbitrarily constructed SMILES entered into the search field are unlikely to match any canonical SMILES however The system will automatically convert your entered SMILES into canonical SMILES representations before searching for exact matches in the database Molecular DescriptorsTop To search for chemicals by molecular descriptors select the descriptors from the drop lists Enter a lower limit inclusive and upper limit exclusive for the descriptor Note that multiple descriptor drop lists and limit fields are provided to allow for the specification of multiple filters simultaneously and logic If no limit values are specified all possible values will be accepted The chemical search results will include the values for all descriptors selected whether or not limit values are actually provided Current descriptors include DescriptorDescriptionSourceMolecular WeightSum of average atomic weights OEChemHeavy AtomsNumber of non hydrogen atoms
