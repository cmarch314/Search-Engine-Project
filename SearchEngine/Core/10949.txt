question of projective geometry so we may dualize switch lines and points So the problem is this Given a finite collection of lines in the plane show that there is an intersection point at which exactly two meet Now remove a line at infinity which is not in the collection and return to the affine plane Consider the triangle ABC of smallest area bounded by three of these lines If there is a tie we fix an origin and choose a minimal triangle whose centroid is as far as possible from that origin Since at least 3 lines meet at each point A B C we can find lines L M and N passing through A B and C respectively and not equal to AB BC or CA If L and M meet at X M and N at Y and N and L at Z triangles XBC AYC and ABZ have area greater than or equal to that of ABC But it is easy to show that if you divided a triangle XYZ into 4 parts by choosing a point on each side and connecting the area of the center triangle is greater than or equal to the largest of the corner triangles with equality

all in a straight line However if we require that not all the points of S are in a straight line then the statement is true Suppose S is finite Let L be the set of all lines that contain at least two points of S For any line l and any point p let d l p be the distance between l and p Let D be the set of all distances d l p as l ranges over all of L and p ranges over all points in S not on l Since not all the points in S are on a line D is nonempty Since S is finite D is finite and thus D has a least element d Take a line l in L and a point p in S for which this distance is attained Drop a perpendicular from p to l meeting at X We have this picture p d l X Now since l contains at least three distinct points of S by hypothesis either there are two or more points in S to the left of X or there are two or more points in S to the right of X Suppose without loss of generality that the former holds and let p 1 and p 2 be two points in S on l with p 2 closer to X Inspection of similar

Problem 5359 in Vol 73 1966 of the Amer Math Monthly Let S be a finite subset of complex projective 3 dimensional space such that the line through any two points of S contains at least a third point of S show that all the points of S are coplanar We can no longer conclude collinearity because there are counterexamples in the complex plane of which the simplest is the set of nine inflection points of a nondegenerate cubic This was first proved in 1986 by L M Kelly A resolution of the Sylvester Gallai problem of J P Serre Discrete Comput Geom 1 1986 1 1 1 4 using an inequality of Hirzebruch on arrangements of lines or dually of points in the complex projective plane But Hirzebruch s inequality requires Miyaoka s inequality on the characteristic classes of a complex projective 2 fold of general type specifically the surface obtained by taking the square roots of the linear forms on CP 2 defining the lines of the arrangement which seems an outrageously sophisticated tool to apply to such a problem And indeed it turns out that essentially the same idea which gave my proof in P 2 R also does it in P 3 C construct the dual configuration throw away a generic plane to get a configuration of planes in the affine plane C 3 and assuming that these planes are not coincident consider those four non coincident planes forming a tetrahedron of minimal volume the volume is defined as the absolute value of the determinant formed from the coordinates of the four points of triple intersection of the planes Again a contradiction is obtained from tetrahedra formed by other planes which must go through the lines of intersection of those four planes To be sure the proof is not as immediate as in the real case but it is entirely elementary Note that the generalization to projective space over an arbitrary field K won t give rise to any new theorems of this kind if K is of characteristic zero any finite arrangement of points and lines over K can be embedded in complex projective space of the same dimension and if K is of positive characteristic it contains a finite field k and then the points of projective space of arbitrary dimension over k give an obvious
