During the filing fee quarter, students pay one-half the\nregistration fee and do not enroll in any classes.</p>\n<p>The Filing Fee option applies only to students who have completed ALL\nrequirements for a M.S. or Ph.D. degree except for official submission of a\nthesis or dissertation to the University Archives, or completion of the final\nformal examination (e.g., the comprehensive examination).This means that prior\nto the beginning of the \"filing fee\" quarter ALL other requirements for the\ndegree must have been met by the student, including advancement to candidacy\nand the resolution of any NR or I grades. Consult the ICS Graduate Counselors\nfor other policies and limitations related to the filing fee.</p>\n<p>International visa restrictions may preclude filing fee status for\nstudents who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States.\nInternational students should verify their eligibility for filing fee status\nvia the International Center well in advance of need.</p>\n<p>Students should note that there is a separate form when submitting a\nsummer filing fee petition. Both the Filing Fee Petition and the Summer Filing\nFee Petition can be found on the Graduate Division website here.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header\"><a id=\"InAbsentia\" name=\"InAbsentia\"></a>In-Absentia Registration</h4>\n<p>In absentia registration applies to full-time, regularly enrolled and\nregistered students who have an academic need to conduct coursework or research related\nto their degree program outside of California.</p>\n<p>More\ninformation can be found on the In-Absentia Registration Form on the Graduate Division\nwebsite <a href=\"http://www.grad.uci.edu/forms/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Graduate Division Forms\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<h4 class=\"header\"><a id=\"LOA\" name=\"LOA\"></a>Leave of Absence</h4>\n<p>All graduate students can petition for a leave of absence from the\nprogram for a period of up to, but no more than, <em>three quarters total</em>. </p>\n<p>The LOA\npetition is available for download from the Graduate Division website <a href=\"http://www.grad.uci.edu/forms/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Graduate Division Forms\">here</a>. Students should fill out the form\nwell in advance to make sure it gets approved. The campus deadline is\nFriday of the third week of classes. However, ICS recommends that students\nsubmit the Leave of Absence petition by the registration deadline each quarter.</p>\n<p>The leave must be approved by\nboth the ICS Graduate Office and the Dean of Graduate Division, as well as the\nInternational Center for all international students. The Graduate\nDivision will notify students via email once the leave has been approved or\ndenied.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header\"><a id=\"PartTime\" name=\"PartTime\"></a>Part-Time Enrollment</h4>\n<p>Unless\nenrolled in an approved part-time master's degree program (as described in\nUCI&#8217;s General Catalogue), approval of part-time enrollment status may be granted\nonly for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities or health. Eligibility\nfor part-time study also depends on other factors, such as citizenship or residency,\nand fellowships. ICS Ph.D. are typically not eligible to apply.</p>\n<p>The full guidelines to determine part-time eligibility, as\nwell as instructions on how to submit the request, can be found on the Reduced\nFee Part-Time Study Program petition, which can be downloaded from the Graduate\nDivision website <a href=\"http://www.grad.uci.edu/forms/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Graduate Division Forms\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The campus deadline to submit a Part-Time Study petition is noon on\nWednesday of the third week of classes. However, ICS recommends that students\nsubmit the Part-Time petition by the registration deadline each quarter.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header\"><a id=\"SummerEnroll\" name=\"SummerEnroll\"></a>Summer Enrollment</h4>\n<p>Continuing graduate students generally do not need to enroll in Summer\nSession (international students on CPT may be required to enroll). However,\nstudents who will graduate during summer quarter MUST either be enrolled or on\nFiling Fee (if eligible). During the summer, graduating students will generally\nenroll in the minimum allowable units (two) of Individual Study or Thesis\nSupervision with their advisor. Graduating students who do not have an advisor\nshould consult the ICS Graduate Counselors for assistance with summer\nenrollment.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"><div id=\"sidebar_title\">More Graduate &#187;</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../admissions/index.php\">Prospective students</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/index.php\">Programs of study</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/degrees_MSOverview.php\">M.S. degree overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../degrees/degrees_PhDOverview.php\">Ph.D. degree overview</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"../courses/index.php\">Academic year plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../forms/index.php\">Forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"index.php\">Policies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../funding/index.php\">Funding &amp; housing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../computing/account/new.php\">Computing support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../resources.php\">Campus resources</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../about/visit/index.php\">Visit the Bren School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../bin/pdf/grad/Graduate Student Handbook F14-15.pdf\">Graduate Student Handbook</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a> |\n   \n   <!-- <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/sitemap.php\">Site Map</a> | -->\n \n  <a href=\"mailto: i%63%73%77%65%62m%61s%74%65r@%69c%73%2e%75c%69%2eedu\">icswebmaster</a></div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 7555.0}
