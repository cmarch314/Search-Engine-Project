This algorithm\r\nperforms a search in the space of\r\nperfect elimination ordering of vertices of the\r\ngraph. The algorithm uses novel pruning\r\nand propagation techniques which are derived\r\nfrom the theory of graph minors and\r\ngraph isomorphism. We present a new algorithm\r\ncalled minor-min-width for computing\r\na lower bound on treewidth that is used\r\nwithin the branch and bound algorithm and\r\nwhich improves over earlier available lower\r\nbounds. Empirical evaluation of QuickBB on\r\nrandomly generated graphs and benchmarks\r\nin Graph Coloring and Bayesian Networks\r\nshows that it is consistently better than complete\r\nalgorithms like QuickTree(Shoikhet and\r\nGeiger) in terms of cpu time. QuickBB also\r\nhas good anytime performance, being able to\r\ngenerate a better upper bound on treewidth\r\nof some graphs whose optimal treewidth\r\ncould not be computed up to now.\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<!-- <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~csp/r111.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a> <br> -->\r\n<A href=\"r112.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8528.0}
