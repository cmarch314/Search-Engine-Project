Note that G**=G.\nAny cycle in G disconnects G* by the Jordan curve theorem.\nAny acyclic subgraph F of G is a forest and does not disconnect G*\n(you can get from any face to any other face by detouring around\ntrees in F).  So connectedness and acyclicity are dual to each other.\nThis duality forms the basis of the following proof:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nChoose any spanning tree T in G; this is by definition a connected\nacyclic subgraph.  The dual edges of its complement, (G-T)*,\nform an acyclic connected subgraph of G* which is therefore also\na spanning tree.\nThe two trees together have (V-1)+(F-1) edges.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is my favorite proof, and is the one I use when teaching graph theory.\n<a href=\"refs.html#Som\">Sommerville</a> attributes it to <a href=\"refs.html#VS\">Von Staudt</a>.\nIt fits in well with other topics of planar duality such as the fact that\nevery planar graph with all faces even is bipartite (by duality from Euler tours).\nSeveral other proofs of the Euler formula have two versions, one\nin the original graph and one in its dual, but this proof is self-dual\nas is the Euler formula itself.</p>\n\n<p align=center><img src=\"interdig.gif\"></p>\n\n<p>The idea of decomposing a graph into interdigitating trees has proven\nuseful in a number of algorithms, including work of myself and others on\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-eittwy.html\">dynamic\nminimum spanning trees</a> as well as work of Goodrich and Tamassia\non point location.
