Also note that all 20 do not need to be relevant to the entire paper; some may be relate to the problem domain, others to the methodology used, etc.\n\n\n\n\t\t</span></td>\n                            <!-- reading -->\n\n                            <!-- Project -->\n                            <td style=\"width: 448px; height: 24px;\">\n                                <span style=\"font-size: 10pt\"><span>\n1) GWYCF chapter 14, 15 <BR> \n2) <a href = \"http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2005_05_20/noDOI.5936361726185105423\">Tooling Up: Managing Your Advisor</a><BR>\n3) <a href = \"http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2011/110127/full/nj7331-570a.html\">The Care and Maintenance of Your Advisor</a>                                   \n\n\n</span></span></td>\n                            <!-- supplemental Assignments -->\n                        </tr>\n                        <!-- Week 6 -->\n                        <tr bgcolor=\"white\">\n                            <td align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 19px; height: 29px;\" valign=\"top\">\n\n                                <font size=\"2\">6</font></td>\n                            <td align=\"center\" style=\"width: 32px; height: 29px;\">\n                                <font size=\"-1\">11/5</font></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <!-- date --><td align=\"center\" style=\"width: 458px; height: 30px; text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <span style=\"font-size: 10pt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVisitor: Judy Olson, Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences (12:30-1:15)<BR><BR>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollaboration/Time Management\n\t\t                                \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <!-- topic -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <td align=\"center\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 30px; text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <span style=\"font-size: 10pt\">\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRevise the abstract based on your findings from perusing the 20 articles due last week, and write a 750-1000 word related work section for it.
