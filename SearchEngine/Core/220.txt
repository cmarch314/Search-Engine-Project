reviews We apologize for any confusion this causes Document ID 99 92 META REVIEW 1 Briefly summarize the paper in your own words making sure to identify the paper s contribution to the field of HCI The authors discuss how devices like the Actimates Barney can be adapted as control and information providing devices This required reverse engineering the operation of the device learning how to control it for new purposes and most importantly thinking carefully about what it means for such a device to play an interactive role with people and how this affects how we think about computing 2 Select the phrase that best describes the paper s contribution Design for interactive system 3 Review of the paper This is and will be a very controversial paper Reviewers split very cleanly on this paper Half saw it as a very significant investigation into how external portable character like devices can play a role literally in our interactive computational life the other half saw the paper as an almost trivial writeup of some people fiddling around with a toy I feel very strongly that the paper should be accepted It is certainly a non traditional paper that addresses a non traditional topic with non traditional technology But I believe the authors have done it carefully and well They have not simply fiddled around with a toy but have thought carefully about notions of role and character and how even a simple device like that studied here can offer insights into computing This is not to say that I expect we will soon all have Barneys sitting next to our machines But I do expect that future systems will be able to learn a great deal from the work here which is where the direct benefit will come from And it certainly won t be a boring presentation 4 Comment on the paper s written presentation The paper is very well written the occasional bits of humor don t detract from its content or at least it didn t for me I do agree with the points of some reviewers that too much space is devoted to the reverse engineering aspects of the project and that the Barbie discussion could be safely omitted Figures are fine international readers should have no problems 5 Provide any other comments that may be useful to the authors Document ID 99 92 1 1 Briefly summarize the paper in your own words making sure to identify the paper s contribution to the field of HCI The paper describes an experiment in using a commercial toy a Barney doll as an interaction device 2 Select the phrase that best describes the paper s contribution Experience including design briefing case history 3 Review of the paper This has to be one of the funniest papers I have ever read and I certainly do not believe CHI should reject a paper merely because it treated a subject humorously However I felt there were some more serious problems with the paper In particular I found the work not particularly significant in that it reports on one summer s worth of experimentation with one toy There is a laudable attempt to produce general principles and guidelines from this experience but I would rather see a broader base of experience before reaching for such guidelines Finally I find the author s use of the toy in a work office context to be inappropriate Their idea of using PEAs Programmable Embodied Agents follows in a tradition of using plush toys that goes back at least to Druin but these uses have been educational and entertainment oriented One of the important principles of graspable user interfaces is that the form of the interface tool accords with the task for which it is to be used Mapping the waving of Barney s arms to the status of a copier is arbitrary at best 4 Comment on the paper s written presentation The presentation is quite good and the humor helps a good deal 5 Provide any other comments that may be useful to the authors 6 Rating of Paper s acceptability 1 is low 5 is high 2 7 Rate your expertise in the topic area of this paper 1 is low 5 is high 4 Document ID 99 92 2 1 Briefly summarize the paper in your own words making sure to identify the paper s contribution to the field of HCI This paper is part reverse engineering of the ActiMates Barney a big hit at CHI 98 and promising to have a continued presence at CHI 99 part exploration of bleeding edge HCI issues like character based interfaces and embodied interaction and part sheer fun The authors have deconstructed Barney s API in order to use its capabilities to express other applications particularly as proxies for or awareness of system activity or other users The contribution of the paper is the exploration of the use of embodied interaction through a character and at least for the authors the demonstration that off the shelf technology can be adapted to support new applications 2 Select the phrase that best describes the paper s contribution Tool for interactive system design development 3 Review of the paper This work addresses one of the most interesting new areas of HCI namely character based interfaces and embodied interaction The authors provide an excellent if short review of related work including ubiquitous computing and Ishii s tangible bits work at MIT The lessons learned from the literature review last paragraph in the Related Work section is the most valuable conceptual contribution of the paper and it would be great to have a fuller discussion of it particularly in the context of the framework presented later in the paper To that end the discussion of Barbie might be dropped since it is not needed to understand the rest of the paper or at least condensed into a paragraph since Barbie is not studied or discussed further The discussion of how embodied interactions and character based interfaces are different from computer interfaces and what kinds of messages they are particularly well suited for is one of the main benefits others can gain from this work The authors stress over stress I believe the value of the demonstration that these kinds of applications can be built from off the shelf components i e by hacking or is it back hacking Barney but it is not clear how satisfactory their Barney behaviors are particularly without the luxury of arbitrary speech Without a fairly complete ability to program Barney wrt the behaviors he has it seems difficult to argue that it is possible to consider it a development platform and it tends to make the applications the authors create seem a bit like stupid Barney tricks But they are not just that at least to the extent that they constitute a meaningful testbed for exploring ideas about embodied interfaces characters and the authors discuss their applications in these terms So although I think the paper is acceptable the way it currently stands I think it would be much stronger and make a more significant contribution to the CHI community if these aspects were better highlighted in the discussion and better i ntegrated with the literature mentioned in the introduction as related work For example all of the sections at the end elaborating the framework should be discussed together and summarized at the end I read through them all but did not come away with any unified idea about what had been discovered about character based interfaces and or embodied interaction The work is original and valid 4 Comment on the paper s written presentation The writing is clear and appropriate for an international audience The figures are gorgeous too bad they can t be reproduced in color it would not be worth taking them out of context to get them in color I don t get the SWEETPEA in the title though ok she is a character in Popeye but that won t be understood by many non Americans PEA is programmable embodied agents is SWEET supposed to be software tools The acronym term is never used in the paper I would suggest that the title just be software tools for programmable embodied agents or feel free to preface it by Tangible Stuffed Bits see below 5 Provide any other comments that may be useful to the authors I thoroughly enjoyed reading this paper and am sure it will be well received by the CHI 99 audience By the end I was envisioning all the beanie babies teletubbies and other stuffed characters my colleagues and I keep atop our monitors and on our desks coming to life in a veritable tangible stuffed bits universe But rather than recoil in horror it reveals something of what the future of billions of physically detached networked objects might hold I think this is the kind of paper that will entertain as it

This is a sort of interesting paper but it is really in the form of a product announcement There appears to be no science here and very little engineering I got the feeling that this was the

appears to be reverse engineering how to make the product behave as desired instead of as intended At the end of the day the phrase is very much So what 4 Comment on the paper s written presentation

paper I have to say I couldn t tell if this was serious or not The idea of using that annoying little dinosaur in office contexts had me questioning the author s sanity for a bit But I decided that it probably was for real Contribution Pretty clear to me that there s something here Using existing toy devices to provide additional i o channels is an interesting tweak on the some of the tangible ambient media work pioneered by Hiroshi Ishii and others Unlike Ishii the authors propose exploiting features of well known characters using off the shelf toys Although we are seeing more techniques that exploit physical objects as i o devices i think there s something important about the use of well known characters Plus the use of these technologies in office settings vs playrooms Having said that I ll try to provide some suggestions to the authors My main complaint is the overemphasis on reverse engineering Barney A huge chunk of the paper talks about how the designers had to interpret Barney s MIDI stream For one I suspect they could have asked Erik Strommen at Microsoft for the protocol Two I could care less about its protocol Every toy will have its own protocol until some set of toy networking standards are developed so it just doesn t matter What does matter are the types of interaction that you can squeeze out of the purple one Other reviewers may disagree with me on this one But I feel that whole Exploring Barney s Technology section could be eliminated Or replaced by the sentence We had to spend time understanding the communications protocol before we could develop an API Same goes for the talk about LPC and Barney speech I don t care about these issues I only care about what you can do with the current implementation The other complaint is the in my opinion huge assumption that people like to communicate with autonomous characters in computing environments The authors give the example of the Microsoft Paper Clip agent as an interactive proxy While they don t say whether the paper clip man is a successful example or not I know I ve never met anyone who actually likes that feature I mean nobody Ben Schneiderman has posed many arguments against the use of anthropomorphic characters yet his pleas are almost always ignored by those working on character based agents Whether or not people really want talking dinosaurs it is at least useful to acknowledge that there is some dispute over this Instead of boldly stating these characters embody a stronger sense of identity and agency than can be conveyed by a typical graphical interface As a result then they can serve better as channels for carrying particular sorts of information p 2 related work section It just seems like a jump to imagine that a winking Barney gives me any more context than a dialog box stating i messed up your print job I m being grumpy about this point but I think it s fair to state the arguments against anthropomorphic agents The paper does a nice job of spelling out the various applications that have been developed with Barney The real issue for me is the lack of any evaluations formal or informal of these applications I d be happy with knowing how people in the authors workspace felt about Barney at the print queue or flagging incoming mail Do people really see this type of technology as useful Whether anthropomorphic or not it would be useful to get a sense for reactions to computing that lives outside the monitor and keyboard This paper does what much ubiquitous computing research falls prey to nice technology where s the impact So while I think the work is interesting it does nothing to advance my understanding of how such devices could be deployed in my workspace 4 Comment on the paper s written presentation generally well written argument comes across loud and clear i loved the figures as long as international readers understand super dee duper tm i think the paper satisfies that point as well 5 Provide any other comments that may be useful to the authors I griped a lot but I do think the paper adds a new dimension to the ubiquitous computing paradigm Again one day I m sure someone will take the time to actually think about what these things do for people but until then So I weigh towards acceptance of the paper But if informal feedback from users could be added I d feel even stronger about the work 6 Rating of Paper s

Barney resulting in an Interaction Framework 2 Select the phrase that best describes the paper s contribution Interaction technique 3 Review of the paper Concise introduction clearly stating area of discussion and aims of the paper The Related Work section is not very comprehensive the last paragraph is not justified in the context of related previous work in this area In addition it has a limited set of references relying on past CHI papers as a mainstay and the author does not take into account non US work or work in the filed of Intelligent Agents other than by Laurel as I would have expected The Technical Basis section is overlong with too much detail on interaction protocols this part of the paper is more suitable for a technical report rather than a CHI submission It would have been much more appropriate to focus on details of the software infrastructure the figure given Fig 2 is fairly meaningless without explanation and claims that the applications are lightweight portable and seamless are not justified More information on the widget set would have been useful and made this paper more interesting and innovative there is enough informa tion to whet the appetite but not enough for a comprehensive understanding of what the author s aims were Again Figure 4 is not explained at all well and the framework is not introduced or described clearly The Channel Person category especially hard to understand simply referring the reader to other references is not sufficient In all the work as the author states was a brief exploration of a field which merits more detailed and careful investigation and a more carefully reasoned and thoughtful presentation Contribution This is a contribution to a field which may well prove to be a very promising one in terms of interaction techniques and new designs However this is obviously initial exploratory work presented and written I would guess very quickly and needs a much more careful and well designed study with all assumptions clearly stated and rationale suitably justified This paper does not do that but may be of interest as the basis of future studies Validity Very little to comment on in terms of rationale work presented seems to be mostly in terms of these are my experiences Originality Original but with a limited base 4 Comment on the paper s written presentation Written presentation Sometimes well and clearly written but lacking in consistency The text does become dense in places Related Work s last paragraphs for example and with a number of throw way lines or a chatty style in others In

Review of the paper:\n</i><p>\n<blockquote>\nThis work addresses one of the most interesting new areas of HCI, namely\ncharacter-based interfaces and embodied interaction.  The authors provide\nan\nexcellent, if short, review of related work, including ubiquitous computing\nand\nIshii's tangible bits work at MIT.  The \"lessons learned\" from the\nliterature\nreview (last paragraph in the Related Work section) is the most valuable\nconceptual contribution of the paper, and it would be great to have a\nfuller\ndiscussion of it, particularly in the context of the framework presented\nlater\nin the paper.  To that end, the discussion of Barbie might be dropped,\nsince it\nis not needed to understand the rest of the paper (or at least condensed\ninto a\nparagraph, since Barbie is not studied or discussed further).  The\ndiscussion\nof how embodied interactions and character-based interfaces are different\nfrom\n\"computer\" interfaces, and what kinds of messages they are particularly\nwell-suited for is one of the main benefits others can gain from this work.\n<p>\nThe authors stress (over-stress, I believe) the value of the demonstration that these kinds of\napplications can be built from \"off the shelf\" components (i.e., by\nhacking, or\nis it back-hacking? Barney), but it is not clear how satisfactory their\nBarney\nbehaviors are, particularly without the luxury of arbitrary speech.\nWithout a\nfairly complete ability to program Barney (wrt the behaviors he has), it\nseems\ndifficult to argue that it is possible to consider it a development\nplatform,\nand it tends to make the applications the authors create seem a bit like\n\"stupid Barney tricks.\"  But they are not just that -- at least, to the\nextent\nthat they constitute a meaningful testbed for exploring ideas about\nembodied\ninterfaces & characters, and the authors discuss their applications in\nthese\nterms.  So although I think the paper is acceptable the way it currently\nstands, I think it would be much stronger and make a more significant\ncontribution to the CHI community if these aspects were better highlighted\nin\nthe discussion, and better i\nntegrated with the literature mentioned in the introduction as related\nwork.\nFor example, all of the sections at the end elaborating the framework\nshould be\ndiscussed together and summarized at the end -- I read through them all, but\ndid\nnot come away with any unified idea about what had been discovered about\ncharacter-based interfaces and/or embodied interaction.\n<p>\nThe work is original and valid.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<i>\n4. Comment on the paper's written presentation:\n</i><p>\n<blockquote>\nThe writing is clear and appropriate for an international audience.  The\nfigures are gorgeous; too bad they can't be reproduced in color (it would\nnot\nbe worth taking them out of context to get them in color).  I don't get the\n\"SWEETPEA\" in the title, though -- ok, she is a character in Popeye, but\nthat\nwon't be understood by many non-Americans.  PEA is programmable embodied\nagents\n-- is SWEET supposed to be \"software tools\"??  The acronym/term is never\nused in\nthe paper.

Although we are seeing more techniques that\nexploit\nphysical objects as i/o devices, i think there's something important about\nthe\nuse of well known characters.  Plus the use of these technologies in office\nsettings vs. playrooms.\n<p>\nHaving said that, I'll try to provide some suggestions to the authors.  My\nmain\ncomplaint is the overemphasis on reverse engineering Barney.  A huge chunk\nof\nthe paper talks about how the designers had to interpret Barney's MIDI\nstream.\nFor one, I suspect they could have asked Erik Strommen at Microsoft for the\nprotocol.  Two, I could care less about its protocol.  Every toy will have\nits\nown protocol until some set of \"toy networking\" standards are developed, so\nit\njust doesn't matter.  What *does* matter are the types of interaction that\nyou\ncan squeeze out of the purple one.  Other reviewers may disagree with me on\nthis one.  But I feel that whole \"Exploring Barney's Technology\" section\ncould\nbe eliminated.  Or replaced by the sentence, \"We had to spend time\nunderstanding the communications protocol before we could develop an API.\"\n<p>\nSame goes for the talk about LPC and Barney-speech.  I don't care about\nthese\nissues, I only care about what you can do with the current implementation.\n<p>\nThe other complaint is the (in my opinion) huge assumption that people like\nto\ncommunicate with autonomous characters in computing environments.  The\nauthors\ngive the example of the Microsoft Paper Clip agent as an interactive proxy.\n<p>\nWhile they don't say whether the paper clip man is a successful example or\nnot,\nI know I've never met *anyone* who actually likes that feature.  I mean\n*nobody*.\n<p>\nBen Schneiderman has posed many arguments against the use of\nanthropomorphic\ncharacters, yet his pleas are almost always ignored by those working on\ncharacter-based agents.\nWhether or not people really want talking dinosaurs, it is at least useful\nto\nacknowledge that there is some dispute over this.  Instead of boldly\nstating,\n\"these characters embody a stronger sense of identity and agency than can\nbe\nconveyed by a typical graphical interface. As a result, then, they can\nserve\nbetter as channels for carrying particular sorts of information ... (p. 2,\nrelated work section)\"  It just seems like a jump to imagine that a winking\nBarney gives me any more context than a dialog box stating, \"i messed up\nyour\nprint job.\"  I'm being grumpy about this point, but I think it's fair to\nstate\nthe arguments against anthropomorphic agents.\n<p>\nThe paper does a nice job of spelling out the various applications that\nhave\nbeen developed with Barney.  The real issue for me is the lack of any\nevaluations - formal or informal - of these applications.  I'd be happy\nwith\nknowing how people in the authors' workspace felt about Barney at the print\nqueue or flagging incoming mail.  Do people really see this type of\ntechnology\nas useful?  Whether anthropomorphic or not, it would be useful to get a\nsense\nfor reactions to computing that lives outside the monitor and keyboard.\nThis\npaper does what much ubiquitous computing research falls prey to: nice\ntechnology, where's the impact?  So while I think the work is interesting,\nit\ndoes nothing to advance my understanding of how such devices could be\ndeployed\nin my workspace.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<i>\n4.

In\naddition, it\nhas a limited set of references relying on past CHI papers as a mainstay\nand\nthe author does not take into account non-US work or work in the filed of\nIntelligent Agents (other than by Laurel) as I would have expected. The\nTechnical Basis section is overlong with too much detail on interaction\nprotocols: this part of the paper is more suitable for a technical report\nrather than a CHI submission. It would have been much more appropriate to\nfocus\non details of the software infrastructure: the figure given (Fig. 2) is\nfairly\nmeaningless without explanation and claims that the applications are\n\"lightweight, portable and seamless\" are not justified. More information on\nthe\nwidget set would have been useful and made this paper more interesting and\ninnovative: there is enough informa\ntion to whet the appetite but not enough for a comprehensive understanding\nof\nwhat the author's aims were. Again, Figure 4 is not explained at all well\nand\nthe framework is not introduced or described clearly. The Channel/Person\ncategory especially hard to understand: simply referring the reader to\nother\nreferences is not sufficient. In all, the work, as the author states, was a\n\"brief exploration\" of a field which merits more detailed and careful\ninvestigation and a more carefully reasoned and thoughtful presentation.\n<p>\nContribution - This is a contribution to a field which may well prove to be\na\nvery promising one in terms of interaction techniques and new designs.\nHowever\nthis is obviously initial exploratory work, presented and written (I would\nguess) very quickly and needs a much more careful and well-designed study\nwith\nall assumptions clearly stated and rationale suitably justified. This paper\ndoes not do that but may be of interest as the basis of future studies.\nValidity - Very little to comment on in terms of rationale: work presented\nseems to be mostly in terms of \"these are my experiences\".\n<p>\nOriginality - Original but with a limited base.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<i>\n4. Comment on the paper's written presentation:\n</i>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\nWritten presentation - Sometimes well and clearly written but lacking in\nconsistency. The text does become dense in places (Related Work's last\nparagraphs for example) and with a number of throw-way lines or a \"chatty\"\nstyle in others. In addition, the references in the paper are not in CHI\nstandard format.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<i>\n5. Provide any other comments that may be useful to the authors.\n</i>\n<p>\n<i>\n6.
