Given a graph <I>G</I>=(<I>V,E</I>) and a set of terminal pairs (or\nrequests) <I>T</I>, the problem is to find a maximum subset of the pairs in\n<I>T</I> for which it is possible to select paths such that each pair is\nconnected by <I>k</I> edge-disjoint paths and the paths for different pairs\nare mutually disjoint.  To the best of our knowledge, no nontrivial\nresult is known for this problem for <I>k</I>&gt;1. To measure the performance\nof our algorithms we use the recently introduced flow number <I>F</I> of a\ngraph. This parameter is known to fulfill <I>F=O</I>(<I>Delta alpha</I><sup>-1</sup> log\n<I>n</I>), where <I>Delta</I> is the maximum degree and <I>alpha</I> is the edge\nexpansion of <I>G</I>. We show that a simple, greedy online algorithm\nachieves a competitive ratio of <I>O</I>(<I>k</I><sup>3</sup> <I>F</I>), which naturally\nextends the best known bound of <I>O</I>(<I>F</I>) for <I>k</I>=1 to higher <I>k</I>.  To\nachieve this competitive ratio, we introduce a new method of\nconverting a system of <I>k</I> disjoint paths into a system of <I>k</I>\nlength-bounded disjoint paths.\n<P>\nIn addition, we study the <I>k disjoint flows problem</I> (<I>k</I>-DFP),\nwhich is a generalization of the previously studied unsplittable flow\nproblem (UFP). The difference between the <I>k</I>-DFP and the <I>k</I>-EDP is\nthat now we consider a graph with edge capacities and our requests are\nallowed to have arbitrary demands <I>d<sub>i</sub></I>. The aim is to find a subset\nof requests of maximum total demand for which it is possible to select\nflow paths such that all the capacity constraints are maintained and\neach selected request with demand <I>d<sub>i</sub></I> is connected by <I>k</I> disjoint\npaths, each of flow value <I>d<sub>i</sub>/k</I>.\n<P>\nThis talk is based on work done jointly with Amitabh Chaudhary,\nChristian Scheideler and Petr Kolman.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 11150.0}
