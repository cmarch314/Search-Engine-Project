{"text": "Computational Complexity of Games and Puzzles Many of the games and puzzles people play are interesting because of their difficulty it requires cleverness to solve them Often this difficulty can be shown mathematically in the form of computational intractibility results every NP complete problem is in some sense a puzzle and conversely many puzzles are NP complete Two player games often have higher complexities such as being PSPACE complete WW pp 218 219 see references below is disparaging of this sort of result writing that this asymptotic result says little about the difficulties of calculating good strategies describing NP hard game positions as degenerate and relatively dull and advocating as a response to hardness proofs looking for additional rules and conditions that would make the game easier But to me NP completeness is not the end but the beginning of the study of a game it shows that the game is complex enough that we can encode interesting computational problems within it If a game is in P it becomes no fun once you learn the trick to perfect play but hardness results imply that there is no such trick to learn the game is inexhaustible And of course NP completeness or PSPACE completeness doesn t even rule out the possibility of computing game values exactly true it seems to imply that worst case exponential algorithms are required but there is still plenty of interesting work in designing analyzing and implementing such algorithms There is a curious relationship between computational difficulty and puzzle quality To me the best puzzles are NP complete although some good puzzles are in P relying on gaps in human intuition rather than on computational complexity for their difficulty Some puzzles are even harder than NP for instance sliding block puzzles and Sokoban are PSPACE complete but to me this means only that the problem can have an annoyingly long sequence of manipulations in its solution For two player games one encounters a similar phenomenon at a higher level of complexity The tree of potential interactions in a game typically gives rise to PSPACE completeness results of a sort I find more interesting than PSPACE completeness in puzzles However some games are harder EXPTIME complete which to me means that it may sometimes be necessary for a well played game to go on for a tediously long sequence of moves Perhaps some games or puzzles in which the players start with incomplete knowledge of the game or puzzle configuration might lead to other types of completeness e g MA completeness or P completeness for finding the starting move most likely to succeed but I know of no such results I primarily list here real games and puzzles games that were invented to be played rather than to be analyzed So I m not including some of the more artificial entries in e g WW or GJ such as sequential truth assignment If someone can point me to a tournament for these games a copy of the game sold in stores or a program for people to play them against their computers I ll consider adding them One caveat NP completeness is not a concept that applies to a single puzzle or game position or even a finite collection of positions It only makes sense to talk about an infinite family of problems as being NP complete For this reason games like chess cannot themselves be NP complete as they only have a finite albeit unthinkably large number of possible positions In many cases however there is a natural generalization from some finite game or puzzle to an infinite family of game positions on arbitrarily large game boards in which it makes sense to talk about NP completeness The fact that these infinite generalizations are computationally hard gives us some justification for believing that the original finite games are also hard in some less well defined sense Index Puzzles and solitaire games Alphametics Clickomania Cryptarithms Cubic 15 puzzle Instant Insanity KPlumber Mah Jongg Pearl

clauses and keys We form one stack with one tile from each clause tile group on top in any order underneath which are stacked two tiles from each key tile group For each variable we form three stacks one with a variable tile on top two matched keys and another tile from the same variable tile group one with a variable tile on top of tiles from all clauses in which the variable appears and one with a variable tile on top of tiles from all clauses in which the negated variable appears Then from a satisfying assignment we can produce an ordering of pair removals that frees one pair of tiles from each variable freeing at least one pair of tiles from each clause which in turn frees the keys and the remaining variable and clause tiles Conversely any solution to the Shanghai puzzle produces a

Often\nthis difficulty can be shown mathematically, in the form of\ncomputational intractibility results: every NP-complete problem is\nin some sense a puzzle, and conversely many puzzles are\nNP-complete. Two-player games often have higher complexities such\nas being PSPACE-complete. \n\n<p><i>WW</i> (pp. 218-219; see <a href=\"#refs\">references</a>\nbelow) is disparaging of this sort of result, writing that \"this\nasymptotic result says little about the difficulties of calculating\ngood strategies\", describing NP-hard game positions as \"degenerate\"\nand \"relatively dull\", and advocating (as a response to hardness\nproofs) looking for additional rules and conditions that would make\nthe game easier. But to me NP-completeness is not the end but the\nbeginning of the study of a game: it shows that the game is complex\nenough that we can encode interesting computational problems within\nit. If a game is in P, it becomes no fun once you learn \"the trick\"\nto perfect play, but hardness results imply that there is no such\ntrick to learn: the game is inexhaustible.

Some puzzles are even harder than NP (for instance,\nsliding block puzzles and Sokoban are PSPACE-complete) but to me\nthis means only that the problem can have an annoyingly long\nsequence of manipulations in its solution.

The tree of potential interactions in a game typically\ngives rise to PSPACE-completeness results of a sort I find more\ninteresting than PSPACE-completeness in puzzles. However some games\nare harder, EXPTIME-complete, which to me means that it may\nsometimes be necessary for a well-played game to go on for a\ntediously long sequence of moves. Perhaps some games or puzzles in\nwhich the players start with incomplete knowledge of the game or\npuzzle configuration might lead to other types of completeness\n(e.g. MA-completeness or #P-completeness) for finding the starting\nmove most likely to succeed, but I know of no such results.</p>\n\n<p>I primarily list here real games and puzzles, games that were\ninvented to be played, rather than to be analyzed. So I'm not\nincluding some of the more artificial entries in e.g. <i>WW</i> or\n<i>GJ</i>, such as \"sequential truth assignment\".

Even without ko (special rules related to repetition of\npositions) the game is PSPACE-hard; with ko (Japanese rules) it is EXPTIME-complete.\nIt is apparently still open whether Chinese or US rules Go is EXPTIME-complete.\nEven certain \"simple\" endgames in which the go board has been\ndecomposed into many small independent regions of play are\nPSPACE-hard.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>GJ</i> 257 [GP11].</li>\n<li>D.

The tiles are placed\nrandomly face-up into stacks, forming some particular shape (most\ncomputer solitaire implementations include several shapes of\nvarying difficulty). Only the top tile of a stack is visible,\nalthough some shapes involve tiles partially covered by other tiles\nwhich can be seen but not removed. The object is to remove matching\npairs of uncovered tiles until all tiles have been removed. \n\n<p>Status: NP-complete even if all tile positions are known.\nPSPACE-hard even to approximate the strategy with maximum\nprobability of success when some tiles are covered and unknown.</p>\n\n<p>Proof (of NP-completeness): reduction from 3-SAT. We classify\nthe groups of four tiles into four types: variables, clauses, and\nkeys. We form one stack with one tile from each clause tile group\non top (in any order), underneath which are stacked two tiles from\neach key tile group. For each variable we form three stacks: one\nwith a variable tile on top, two matched keys, and another tile\nfrom the same variable tile group; one with a variable tile on top\nof tiles from all clauses in which the variable appears, and one\nwith a variable tile on top of tiles from all clauses in which the\nnegated variable appears. Then from a satisfying assignment we can\nproduce an ordering of pair removals that frees one pair of tiles\nfrom each variable, freeing at least one pair of tiles from each\nclause, which in turn frees the keys and the remaining variable and\nclause tiles. Conversely any solution to the Shanghai puzzle\nproduces a satisfying assignment from the original 3-SAT\nformula.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A. Condon, J. Feigenbaum, C. Lund, and P.
