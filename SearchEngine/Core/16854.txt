They rely on\nlong-lived hierarchies and impose artificial barriers between documents\nfrom different sources (files, the web, email, and so forth). The\nPlaceless Documents Project is exploring ways to address these problems.\nThe key notion in Placeless is that \"properties\" -- structured metadata\non documents -- can be used to reflect multiple, overlapping work\npractices and can support flexible, dynamic organization and use\nof documents. In this talk, I'll describe the motivations and design\nof the Placeless Documents system, and discuss some of our experiences.\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography:</strong>\nKeith Edwards is a member of the research staff at the Xerox PARC \nComputer Science Lab.  His primary research interests include systems\nsupport for creating novel user interfaces and computer-supported\ncollaboration.  Keith has a Ph.D. in computer science from Georgia Tech.\n\n<p>\n\n<EM><strong><font size=+1>\nSupporting Expertise Recommendations in Organizational Information\nSystems\n</em></strong></em><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dmcdonal\">David W.

This work explores the problem of finding \"expertise\" in\nan organization. An in-depth field study of expertise location in a\nmedium sized software development company demonstrated that expertise\nis fundamentally a collaborative activity. People employ several\ndifferent cognitive and social evaluations when identifying and\nselecting other individuals to pursue for expertise. The results from\nthe field study were then used to inform the design of a system. I\npresent an expertise recommender system that employs heuristics and\ninformation sources similar to those used by the field study\nparticipants.\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Biography:</strong>\nDavid is completing a Ph.D. in Information and Computer\nScience at the University of California, Irvine. His dissertation\nresearch focuses on the problem of designing software that supports\nnuanced interaction among people. David has worked for AT&T\nLabs HCI research group, Apple Computer and Continuus Software\nCorporation. He holds a B.S. in Cognitive Psychology (UCLA) and\nan M.S. in Information and Computer Science (UCI).\n \n<p>\n\n<strong>Coordinator:</strong> \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ackerman\">Mark Ackerman</a>, \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">Information and Computer Science</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine</a>,<br>\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp\n<a href=\"mailto:ackerman@ics.uci.edu\">ackerman@ics.uci.edu</a> \n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_bart.html\">\nDirections</a> to the meeting are available.\n\n<p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<Strong>Next Meeting:</strong><br>\nFriday, May 14, 1999<br>\nTopic: Electronic Commerce 2<br>\nCoordinator: Patricia Cornwell, Hewlett Packard, \n<a href=\"mailto:patricia_cornwell@hp.com\">\npatricia_cornwell@hp.com</a>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Irvine Research Unit in Software wishes to thank its \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsors.html\">\ncorporate sponsors</a>:\n\n<p>\n\nSustaining:\n<blockquote>\nThe Boeing Company * IBM * Microsoft Corporation * Northrop Grumman Corporation\n<br>Raytheon Company * Sun Microsystems Laboratories *  TRW</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nSupporting:\n<blockquote>\n    Beckman Coulter * FileNet Corporation * Printronix, Inc.<br>\n    Continuus Software Corporation * Hewlett Packard\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n \nFor further information on \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/bart/bart.html\">BART</a> or \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">IRUS,</a> contact <br>\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/staff.html\">Debra Brodbeck</a> \nat (949) 824-2260; \n<a href=\"mailto: brodbeck@ics.uci.edu\">brodbeck@ics.uci.edu</a>\n \n<p>\n \n<P>\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\nUniversity of California, Irvine  CA 92697-3425 <BR>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 16854.0}
