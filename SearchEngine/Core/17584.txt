of parallel programming including foundational and theoretical aspects techniques languages compilers runtime systems tools and practical experiences In the context of the symposium parallel programming encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems multicore multithreaded heterogeneous clustered systems distributed systems grids clouds and large scale machines Given the rise of parallel architectures into the consumer market desktops laptops and mobile devices PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads techniques and tools that attempt to improve the productivity of parallel programming and work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to Parallel programming theory and models Formal analysis and verification Parallel programming languages Compilers and runtime systems Task parallel libraries Parallel application frameworks Software productivity for parallel programming Middleware for parallel systems Performance analysis debugging and optimization Development analysis or management tools Parallel algorithms Parallel applications Concurrent data structures Synchronization and concurrency control Software engineering for parallel programs Fault tolerance for parallel systems Software for heterogeneous architectures Programming tools for parallel and heterogeneous systems Parallelism in non scientific workloads web servers search analytics Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community Papers describing experiences should indicate how they illustrate general principles papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice Poster submissions should meet similar criteria for originality and relevance but may present emerging ideas or

htm use the 9 pt template Over length submissions will be summarily discarded by the Program Chair Submissions will be judged on correctness relevance originality significance and clarity Paper submission is double blind to reduce reviewer bias against or for authors or institutions Thus the submissions cannot include author names institutions or hints based on references to prior work If authors are extending their own work they need to reference and discuss the past work in third person as if they were extending someone else s research We realize that for some papers it will still reveal authorship but as long as an effort was made to follow these guidelines the submission will not be penalized Authors must identify any conflicts of interest with PC members and external review committee members as defined here http www sigplan org review policies htm ACM SIGPLAN policy Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions but may not exceed 2 pages in length Paper submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered for posters authors who do not want their paper considered for the poster session should indicate this in their abstract submission Two page summaries of posters will be included in the conference proceedings The proceedings will be published by ACM Press Authors of accepted papers and posters will be

\n<center><h2>Call for Papers</h2></center> \n \n<p>\nPPoPP is a forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including \nfoundational and theoretical aspects, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime \nsystems, tools, and practical experiences. In the context of the symposium, \"parallel \nprogramming\" encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, \nmultithreaded, heterogeneous, clustered systems, distributed systems, grids, clouds, \nand large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures into the consumer \nmarket (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices), PPoPP is particularly interested in \nwork that addresses new parallel workloads, techniques, and tools that attempt to \nimprove the productivity of parallel programming, and work towards improved synergy \nwith such emerging architectures.  Specific topics of interest include (but are not \nlimited to):\n<UL>\n  <li> Parallel programming theory and models\n  <li> Formal analysis and verification\n  <li> Parallel programming languages\n  <li> Compilers and runtime systems\n  <li> Task-parallel libraries\n  <li> Parallel application frameworks\n  <li> Software productivity for parallel programming\n  <li> Middleware for parallel systems\n  <li> Performance analysis, debugging and optimization\n  <li> Development, analysis, or management tools\n  <li> Parallel algorithms\n  <li> Parallel applications\n  <li> Concurrent data structures\n  <li> Synchronization and concurrency control\n  <li> Software engineering for parallel programs\n  <li> Fault tolerance for parallel systems\n  <li> Software for heterogeneous architectures\n  <li> Programming tools for parallel and heterogeneous systems\n  <li> Parallelism in non-scientific workloads: web servers, search, analytics\n</UL>\n\n<p>\nPapers should report on original research relevant to parallel\nprogramming, and should contain enough background materials to make\nthem accessible to the entire parallel programming research community.\n\n<p>\nPapers describing experiences should indicate how they illustrate\ngeneral principles; papers about parallel programming foundations\nshould indicate how they relate to practice.  Poster submissions\nshould meet similar criteria for originality and relevance, but may\npresent emerging ideas or results that are not yet sufficiently\ndeveloped for a full paper.\n\n\n<p>\nAll submissions must be made electronically through the conference web\nsite. Abstracts must include contact information, the full list of\nauthors and their affiliations, and a description (100-400 words) of\nthe anticipated content of the paper. Full paper submissions must be\nin PDF formatted for US lettersize paper. They must not exceed 10\npages (all inclusive) in standard ACM two-column conference format\n(preprint mode, with page number). Templates for ACM format are\navailable for Microsoft Word, and LaTeX at\n<a href=\"http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm\">\nhttp://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm</a> (use the 9 pt\ntemplate). Over-length submissions will be summarily discarded by the\nProgram Chair. Submissions will be judged on correctness, relevance,\noriginality, significance, and clarity.\n\n<p>\nPaper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against or\nfor authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include\nauthor names, institutions or hints based on references to prior\nwork. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference\nand discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending\nsomeone else's research. We realize that for some papers it will still\nreveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these\nguidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Authors must\nidentify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external\nreview committee members, as defined here:\nhttp://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm (ACM SIGPLAN policy).\n\n<p>\nPoster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but\nmay not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not\naccepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered\nfor posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the\nposter session should indicate this in their abstract\nsubmission. Two-page summaries of posters will be included in the\nconference proceedings.\n\n<p>\nThe proceedings will be published by ACM Press. Authors of accepted\npapers and posters will be required to sign the ACM copyright\nform. Instructions for preparing papers for the proceedings will be\nemailed to authors of accepted papers. Instructions for preparing\npapers for the proceedings will be emailed to authors of accepted\npapers.\n\n<p>Important Dates (Tentative):<br>\n<UL>\n  <li> Abstract Submission Deadline: Aug. 10, 2012 (11:59pm Eastern Daylight Time)\n  <li> Paper Submission Deadline: Aug. 17, 2012 (11:59pm EDT, no extensions)\n  <li> Author Rebuttal Period: <s> October 22-24, 2012 </s> Begins October 28 and ends October 31, 2012 at 18:00 (6:00pm) Eastern Time\n  <li> Author Notification: November 12, 2012 \n  <li> Camera Ready Submission: January 06, 2013 (11:59pm Eastern Daylight Time) <font size=\"3\" color=\"red\"><b>Hard deadline.
