We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm\nfor the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to\nsplit in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the\nother augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries\nand merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented\nmodel. We implement the algorithms and report some preliminary\nexperimental results.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"http://www.graphics.ics.uci.edu/publications/BDEG05\">Graphics\nlab pubs page</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Curvature-aware fundamental cycles</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pablo/\">P.
