distinguishing data types and interpreting error messages Quiz 6 Take the quiz for self scored credit at EEE available Sunday through 11 pm on Tuesday February 17 Quiz text for later reference Quiz answers for still later reference Topics String formatting string processing list processing The wrong way to use the quizzes is to glance over them say Yeah that looks okay and just type anything related into the answer blanks on EEE You ll still get the credit but you won t get the experience of actually doing the problems and that s what you ll need for the midterms the final and just basically learning the course material so you ll succeed in the next course Instead work out each problem pretend it s a real quiz Don t look up the answers in the book or on line by the time the quiz comes around you re supposed to be familiar with the topics If you re not you might consider spending more time with the textbook or being a more actively questioning partner in the lab An even more foolish approach to self grading is to answer random nonsense like Zot Zot Zot to every question giving them no thought at all The wise student will take the time to work through the quizzes independently recognizing that these are previews of exam questions and an excellent way to prepare review and assess one s mastery of the material before the stakes get higher The text of the quizzes will be posted on this page that way if you should miss the EEE quiz period you can still see the content of the quiz even if you don t get credit Try not to miss any quizzes on EEE though because it s easy credit that everyone else is getting If you happen to miss one it s not a big deal but the Tuesday deadline is firm we can t extend it for people who just got busy and forgot Even though the quiz contents are available on this page be sure to open up the quiz on EEE before the Tuesday deadline EEE won t give you credit if you try to open the EEE quiz after the window closes around 11 The answers will also be posted The answers may even be posted before the EEE quiz period ends Again copying them into EEE doesn t get you more credit but it does short cut the actual experience you need to actually develop proficiency How do you know if your answer is correct if it doesn t match the printed answer exactly Eventually you ll develop an understanding of what differences are important but in the meantime check with your TA or lab tutor or if the answer is Python code simply try to run your answer and see if it behaves properly or see if the assertions pass Midterms Below are copies of past ICS 31 midterms The most effective way to use these to study or review is to block out the answers entirely and try to answer the questions for real Fall 2 12 First Midterm with answers Fall 2
