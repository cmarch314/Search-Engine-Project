{"text": "Polyominoes and Other Animals Connected subsets of the square lattice tiling of the plane are called polyominoes These are often classified by their number of squares so e g a tetromino has four squares and a pentomino has five this nomenclature is by analogy to the word domino a shape formed by two connected squares but unrelated in etymology to the roots for two or square If a polyomino or a higher dimensional collection of cubes forms a shape topologically equivalent to a ball it is called an animal A famous open problem asks whether any animal in three dimensions can be transformed into a single cube by adding and removing cubes at each step remaining an animal it is known that removal alone does not always work Other related figures include polyiamonds collections of equilateral triangles polyabolos collections of half squares and polyhexes collections of regular hexagons Anna s pentomino page Anna Gardberg makes pentominoes out of sculpey and agate Blocking
