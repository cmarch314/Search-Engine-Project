We are interested in graphical model optimization tasks (e.g., Weighted CSP), which can be formulated as finding the m-best solution-paths in a weighted search graph. Specifically, we present m-A*, extending the well-known A* to the m-best problem, and prove that all A*\u2019s properties are maintained, including soundness and completeness of m-\r\nA*, dominance with respect to improved heuristics and most significantly optimal efficiency compared with any other search algorithm that use the same heuristic function. We also present and analyse m-B&B, an extension of a Depth First Branch and Bound algorithm to the task of finding the m best solutions. Finally, for graphical models, a hybrid of A* and a variable-elimination scheme yields an algorithm which has the best complexity bound compared with earlier known m-best algorithms.\r\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r184.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8701.0}
