There will be two midterm exams The dates are Midterm 1 Wednesday February 4 Wednesday of week 5 Midterm 2 Wednesday March 4 Wednesday of week 9 The midterm exams will be given in lecture You will have until the end of the discussion period to finish the exam a total of 2 hours 2 minutes although this should be much more time than you actually need No make up midterm exams will be given no matter how valid your reason for missing it Instead I will assign a grade based on how you do on the final exam So if you miss a midterm exam plan to do really well on the final exam Drop Add Policy For the first two weeks of the quarter all adds and drops will be handled automatically through the Registrar s WebReg system When the two week period expires All students on the wait list will be automatically added to the class From that point on drops will not be allowed Exceptions will only be allowed in truly extaordinary circumstances preapproved by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies on a case by case basis Grading The grading will be based on the two midterm exams and the final exam An exact breakdown will be posted here later in the quarter The policy for assigning grades will be as follows Excellent or superior performance in the course will result in an A or A Adequate performance in the course will result in a B or B grade Poor performance in the course may result in a grade of C or lower The standard for passing the CompSci 26 portion of the Masters Exam will be performing at an excellent or superior level i e A or better on the final exam Under certain circumstances upon request I may give a grade of S or U Satisfactory of Unsatisfactory rather than a letter grade Such a grade will be assigned only if you request it and I approve your request I will only approve such a request if you have not already taken this class in a previous offering If you think you might want be assigned an S U grade instead of a letter grade you should talk to me Homework problems Recommended homework assignments will be posted weekly The homework will not be collected or graded Click here for the homework assignments Course textbook Kleinberg and Tardos Algorithm Design Addison Wesley 2 6 The course will cover the first eight chapters of this book along with a small number of supplementary readings Note on Email If you send me email about the course please do the following Please include the string CompSci 26 at the start of the subject line to ensure that it gets past my spam filter Please include your name and student number in the message If you are not writing me from your official UCI email address please cc your official UCI email address The reason for the first request is self explanatory The second and the third are because I occasionally get email from non UCI students asking for help on problems and I want to weed them out Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled in the class If for some
