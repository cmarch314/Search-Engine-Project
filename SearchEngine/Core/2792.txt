Ideally, we would like your article to qualify for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_criteria\">\"Good Article\" status</a>. For reference, less than 1% of the articles on Wikipedia achieve this status, so this is no small feat!\n\n<p> Here a few caveats to keep in mind for this assignment:\n\n<ul>\n<p></p><li> You will need to learn some basic wiki code. The code is not difficult, and there is a graphical editor with buttons to insert links and the like.\n<p></p><li> Others can (and will) alter your contribution. In most cases, other users will add to and occasionally correct your work. But your work could be vandalized or deleted. You can always change the page back to what it was before, but such \"revert wars\" are frowned upon.\n<p></p><li> The entire Wikipedia is licensed under the the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License\">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, which means <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN\">you do not own the articles</a> you work on.\n<p></p><li> There is no standard length for a Wikipedia article. For the purposes of this assignment, a reasonable article will contain 600-1000 words, which correspond to 3-5 pages of standard double-space text.\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Part 1: Select a stub</h2>\nNote that past 139W students found that it was crucial to select a good stub whose topic for which a lot of literature is available, but which isn't covered extensively on Wikipedia. \n<ul>\n<p></p><li> Complete this Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_students\"> Tutorial</a>.\n<p></p><li> Create an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_students/Creating_an_account\">account </a>.\n<p></p><li> Find a \"stub\" that you would like to complete to a full article. Here is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/List_of_stubs\n\">list of stubs</a>. Particular stub categories that may be of interest include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_science_stubs\">computer science</a> stubs and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:California_university_stubs\">California university</a> stubs. Here are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SUBSTUB#Differences_between_a_stub_and_a_substub\">tips</a> for picking a good stub.\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Part 2: Write a Good Article</h2>\nOur goal is to produce a Good Article that will be of service to the general Wikipedia community. We need to have a sense of what more needs to be done, and an overall plan for the article. I suggest looking at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GA\"> examples</a>  and guidelines (e.g. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style\">Manual of Style</a> or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_for_nominating_good_articles\">Guide for nominating good articles</a>), as well as reminding yourself of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_criteria\">criteria</a> for a Good Article. I suggest finding an example of a Good Article related to your stub, and follow its structure including its section headings. Note that achieving a Good Article status typically takes more time than what we will have available for the class, but we will attempt it nonetheless.\n\n<h2> Instructions (submissions must follow  <a href=\"requirements.html\">guidelines</a>) </h2>\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\"> Topic post:</span> Select a stub and prepare an introductory e-mail message to the TA. Rather than sending it, upload it to the Wikipedia Topic forum on the EEE class message board. Make sure the email includes a link to the stub article.\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\"> Electronic submission: </span> When submitting an electronic version of your draft/final, save your changes to Wikipedia and upload a textfile with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Permanent_link\">permanent link</a> to your particular version of the article to EEE. Make sure the textfile includes your <b> name, student ID, and wikipedia account name</b>.\n\n<p><span class=\"h2\">Hard copy submission:</span> When submitting a hard copy of your draft/final, click on the \"Printable Version\" link at the left margin of any Wikipedia page and generate a printout. Make sure to write your <b> name, student ID, and wikipedia account name</b> on your hard copy.\n\n<h2> Suggestions and hints </h2>\n\n<ul>\n<p></p><li> Select a stub for which you can find at least two good references, following Wikipedia's guidelines for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources\">reliable sources</a>.\n\n<p></p><li> You will be writing an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_in_brief\"> encyclopedic article</a> that is neutral and verifiable by established facts. You will not be collecting data, analyzing it, or writing about your experiences. You will not be writing an essay with personal opinions or judgments.\n<p></p><li> One of the exciting aspects of Wikipedia is its dynamic and communal nature. You are free (and encouraged) to use Wikiepdia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PR\"> Peer Review</a> to provide feedback on your article before submitting the final copy. It is likely that you will receive messages from editors. Be polite in replying, and don't hesitate to ask them to explain something.\n<p></p><li> Avoid simply copying text from a reference. Isolated quotations are okay, but most of time, it is better to use a summary or paraphrase of the quotation that flows better with the rest of your article. See Wikipedia policies on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copy-paste\">copying</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Quotations\">quoting</a> sources.\n<p></p><li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles\">Here</a> is a useful Wikipedia page giving general advice for writing good articles.\n\n<p></p><li> Finally, we will grade this assignment using the following <a href=\"wikipedia_rubric.txt\">rubric</a>.\n</ul>\n\n<h3> Acknowledgements</h3>\nMuch of this material is based on assignments prepared by Piotr Konieczny at the University of Pittsburgh and Dean Taciuch at George Mason University.\n  </body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2792.0}
