in conjunction with NIPS 2 13 Important Dates Submission deadline October 15 2 13 Acceptance Notification October 3 2 13 Workshop December 9 2 13 Overview Machine learning systems involve an integration of data representing human or physical knowledge and algorithms that discover patterns in this data and make predictions about new instances While machine learning research usually focuses on developing more efficient learning algorithms it is often the quality and amount of training data that predominately govern the performance of real world systems This is only amplified by the recent popularity of large scale and complicated learning systems such as deep networks which can require millions to billions of training instances to perform well Unfortunately traditional methods of collecting data from specialized workers are usually expensive and slow In recent years however a potential for change has emerged thanks to crowdsourcing which enables huge amounts of labeled data to be collected from large groups of usually online workers for a low cost or no cost at all Many machine learning tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing increasingly benefit from data gathered on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower On the other hand tools in machine learning game theory and mechanism design can help to address many challenging problems in crowdsourcing systems such as making them more reliable more efficient and less expensive In this workshop we call attention to crowdsourcing as a source of data discussing cheap and fast data collection methods based on crowdsourcing and how these methods could impact subsequent stages of machine learning Furthermore we will emphasize how the data sourcing paradigm interacts with the most recent emerging trends in the NIPS community Examples of topics of interest in the workshop include but are not limited to Applications of crowdsourcing to machine learning Reliable crowdsourcing e g label aggregation quality control Optimal budget allocation or active learning in crowdsourcing Pricing and incentives in crowdsourcing markets Workflow design and answer aggregation for complex tasks e g machine translation proofreading Prediction markets information markets and their connection to learning Theoretical analyses of crowdsourcing algorithms e g error
