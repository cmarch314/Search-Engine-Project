Introduction\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n\n<p> This is an online repository of <I> large data sets</I> which encompasses a wide variety of data types, analysis tasks, and application areas. The primary role of this repository is to enable researchers in knowledge discovery and data mining to scale existing and future data analysis algorithms to very large and complex data sets. \n\n<p> Creation of this archive was supported by a grant from the Information\nand Data Management Program at the National Science Foundation.\nThe archive is intended to serve as a permanent repository of \npublicly-accessible data sets for research in KDD and data mining. It \ncomplements the original \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html\">\nUCI Machine Learning Archive\n</A>, which typically focuses on smaller classification-oriented data sets.\n\n\n<p> In addition to storing data and description files, we also archive task files that describe a specific analysis, such as clustering or regression, for the data sets stored. The <a href=\"cfd.html\">call for data sets</A> lists typical data types and tasks of interest.\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!

Citation Information\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2>Citation Information</H2>\n\n<p>If you publish material based on databases obtained from this repository, then, in your acknowledgments, please note the <a href = \"acknowledgments.html\"> assistance you received</a> by using this repository. This will help others to obtain the same data sets and replicate your experiments. We suggest the following pseudo-APA reference format for referring to this repository:\n\n<blockquote>\n      Hettich, S. and Bay, S. D. (1999). The UCI KDD Archive [http://kdd.ics.uci.edu].\n      Irvine, CA: University of California, Department of Information and \n      Computer Science.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p> We also request that you send the citation information for your \narticle to <b>kdd '@' ics.uci.edu</b>. If your article is available online \nand \nyou provide us with a url, we will link the data set's documentation to your file. \n\n\n\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!  Donor Information\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2>How to Donate Data and Task Files</H2>\n\n<p>We are always looking for additional data sets and task files. Note that you may submit: (1) data and a description file, (2) a task file describing a particular analysis for a data set, or (3) both. There may be multiple task files for the same data set and the author of a task file may be different from the data donor.\n\n<p>If you are in doubt as to whether a data set or task file would be of interest, please contact the librarian. Donations may be made with anonymous ftp as follows:\n\n<ol>\n  <li> ftp kdd.ics.uci.edu\n  <li> user name: anonymous\n  <li> password: your complete email address\n  <li> cd incoming\n  <li> put filename (note: you will not be able to list the placed files)\n  <li> bye\n  <li> send e-mail to <b>kdd '@' ics.uci.edu</b> specifying the donated \nfile(s).\n</ol>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you may provide us a web url and we will download the data. If neither of these methods is suitable, please contact the librarian and we will arrange the transfer of data in the most convienent manner for you.\n\n<p>As many researchers use this archive, please carefully fill out a data documentation form when you submit data. If you are submitting an analysis of data, please fill out a task documentation form:\n\n<UL>\n  <LI> <A href=\"doc/data.form\"> data documentation guidelines</a> (a description of the data)\n  <LI> <A href=\"doc/task.form\"> task documentation guidelines</a> (a description of the analysis task)\n</UL>\n\n<p>There are several sample files, which may help you fill out the documentation:\n\n<UL>\n  <LI> <A href=\"sample/msweb.data.sample\"> sample data form</a>\n  <LI> <A href=\"sample/msweb.task.sample\"> sample task form</a>\n</UL>\n\n\n<p>We prefer that the data have a standard format.  For multivariate data sets\nthat can be represented by a table, please format the data to have\none instance/example per line, no spaces, commas separated attributes \nvalues, and missing values denoted by \"?\". For other types of data, use your \nbest judgment.\n\n<p>Thank you for your donations.\n\n<p>David Newman (librarian)\n\n<p>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<b>kdd '@' ics.uci.edu</b><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</a><BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">University of California, Irvine</a><br>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\nLast modified: Sept 9, 2005\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "id": 10490.0}
