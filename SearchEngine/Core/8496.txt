This yields AND/OR multivalued\r\ndecision diagram (AOMDD) which compiles a constraint network into a\r\ncanonical form that supports polynomial time queries such as solution counting,\r\nsolution enumeration or equivalence of constraint networks.We provide a compilation\r\nalgorithm based on Variable Elimination for assembling an AOMDD for a\r\nconstraint network starting from the AOMDDs for its constraints. The algorithm\r\nuses the APPLY operator which combines two AOMDDs by a given operation.\r\nThis guarantees the complexity upper bound for the compilation time and the size\r\nof the AOMDD to be exponential in the treewidth of the constraint graph, rather\r\nthan pathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs).\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r135.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8496.0}
