That is, K<sub>3</sub> and\nK<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.\nThis paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in\nthe planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.\nAlso, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar\ngraphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.\n<p>\nMore generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the\nsmallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>\nis a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear\nsubgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an\n(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely\nK<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not\nhave linear subgraph multiplicity.\nWhen x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal\nforbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear\nsubgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.\n<p>\nPlease refer only to the journal version, and not the earlier technical\nreport: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal\nversion.\n<p>(<a href=\"/~eppstein/bibs/eppstein.html#Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity\">BibTeX</a> --\n<a href=\"http://fano.ics.uci.edu/cites/Document/Connectivity-graph-minors-and-subgraph-multiplicity.html\">Citations</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"jour.html\">Journals</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
