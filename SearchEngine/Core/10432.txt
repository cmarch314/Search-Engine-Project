circumstances When you write me an email please take a few moments to make sure that the following information is placed somewhere in your message your name your student ID and which course you re enrolled in important since I m teaching more than one this quarter Course staff In addition to me this course is staffed by a number of folks in a few different roles They are listed below Teaching assistants There are seven teaching assistants each of whom is assigned to two lab sections see below for an indication of which TA is assigned to which section Among other roles the teaching assistants are the primary points of contact with regard to the grading of projects Boyang Wei boyanw1 AT uci DOT edu Duy Quoc Lai laid AT uci DOT edu Fausto Artico fausto artico AT gmail DOT com

will also be staffing the labs at various times specified further below Binh LeEfren AguilarJianyu ZhengKevin CarlisleWilmer Domingo Times and places Lecture This course has two lectures and each of you is enrolled in one or the other They meet on the following days and times Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 3 4 5 pm in HSLH 1 ATuesdays and Thursdays from 5 6 2 pm in ELH 1 The lectures will be more or less the same there may be slight differences particularly on days after one lecture ends up a little ahead of the other due to differences in questions asked etc While you should generally attend the lecture in which you re enrolled you can substitute the other once in a while provided there are available seats Given the course s size attendance is not graded but we certainly recommend it Naturally attendance is required on the days when exams are held which are listed in the Schedule It should be noted that you must attend the exams in the lecture in which you are officially enrolled Labs The ICS 32 Help Center There are four lab sections meeting throughout the day on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays Collectively we will refer to all of these hours as the ICS 32 Help Center which meet at the following locations and times Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 8 am 7 5 am in ICS 183Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 8 am 3 5 pm in ICS 192Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 8 am 9 5 am in ICS 364AMondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 12 pm 1 5 pm in ICS 364AMondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 4 pm 7 5 pm in ICS 364A While you are required to be enrolled in a lab section and this enrollment does determine who will grade your projects and with whom you are permitted to partner when working in pairs you are generally free to attend the ICS 32 Help Center whenever you need it regardless of which lab section you are enrolled in with two caveats When working in pairs you are expected to be physically in the same place working together on everything you do so you will be expected either to attend your scheduled lab or both you and your partner can mutually agree on an alternative arrangement Note that mutual agreement does not mean one partner saying I m not going to be able to make it sorry If you can t make an agreement on times to work best not to partner with each other You will be guaranteed a seat in your enrolled lab section and hence it is possible that you may occasionally be asked to leave to make room for someone else if we are full beyond capacity and you are not officially enrolled in a section While it is not a required part of the course and nothing will be graded in the labs this quarter attendance does offer some significant benefits You will have a chance to consult a TA and one or more lab tutors regarding your work this kind of fast feedback and help can be invaluable as you work through your projects Some of your work this quarter will be done in pairs using a technique called pair programming The lab sections offer built in overlap in your and your partner s schedules You will be surrounded by a large group of other people facing the same problems that you re facing This kind of shared journey will help you to build a social network that will last you in some cases for the rest of your life Don t squander that opportunity Some of our lab sections are laptop only sections which means that there are no computers available for general use except one that you bring for yourself However these sections will be staffed with the same personal help available in the others so if you tend to carry a laptop around with you anyway you may find it at least as comfortable as the alternative Staffing in the ICS 32 Help Center will be as follows The TAs listed for the sections below are the official TAs of record so in general they would be your first point of contact regarding the grading of projects Lab SectionLocationTATutor s Lab 1 MWF 8 9 5 amICS 183Laleh BeniTBDLab 2 MWF 1 11 5 amICS 183Laleh BeniTBDLab 3 MWF

in ICS 243 not my office as it s in a building that will be locked during at least part of that time during which I m available to chat with you about whatever s on your mind Office hours begin on Thursday January 8 and continue throughout the quarter Textbooks We will sometimes make use of the same textbook that was used in the previous offering of ICS 31 which is this one Introduction to Computing Using Python An Application Development Focusby Ljubomir PerkovicJohn Wiley Sons Inc 2 12ISBN 978 47 61846 2RECOMMENDED However much of our work will be focused outside of textbooks altogether One of the main skills you ll be building in this course aside from broadening and strengthening your Python programming skills is the ability to find analyze and synthesize information in online documentation tutorials and other materials that make libraries not just those that are included with Python but also those that are obtained from third parties accessible to you and useful in solving real programming problems To that extent the Internet will serve as a significant textbook for us as well Obtaining additional assistance Asking questions of course staff You can most easily get course questions answered by coming to the lecture the ICS 32 Help Center or office hours and asking them I am happy to help you in person when I m available You can also ask questions by sending email to me or your TA or both we check our email periodically throughout the day so you can usually get an answer to course related questions within a few hours and often much more quickly If the questions require a complex or lengthy response we may ask you to see one of us in person As projects approach their due date particularly on days when projects are due we begin to receive quite a bit of email all at once so we may not be able to respond to all messages before the project is due We aren t ignoring you on purpose but unfortunately it s not always possible for the relatively small course staff to answer questions from a large number of students at once A great way to mitigate this problem is to get started early and ask questions sooner in the process Accommodations for disabilities Any students who feel that they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss these specific needs Also contact the Disability Services Center online or by phone at 949 824 7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations such as alternative test taking environments or note taking services can be arranged for you in a timely way Grading Weights of graded artifacts Your course grade will be determined from the weighted combination of your scores on each of six programming projects one Midterm and one Final Exam The weights of each of these are Five programming projects 4 weighted equally at 8 each Midterm 25 Final Exam 35 Determining final grades Course grades will be determined neither on a normal curve nor a straight scale It is guaranteed that overall scores over 9 will receive an A or better scores over 8 will receive a B or better and scores over 7 will receive a C or better However the actual cutoffs may be lowered at the end of the quarter In short it is not my intention to fail half of the students nor am I planning on giving only 2 of the students A s but I prefer not to constrain myself with either a straight scale or a formalized curve Some of the programming projects will ask you to employ a technique called pair programming which is discussed in more detail in the Project Guide There are times that you will be required to participate in pair programming there are other times when it will either be optional or disallowed Each of you will also be asked to fill out an evaluation of your partner after each paired project is due this will give you an opportunity to let us know confidentially whether your experience with your partner was a positive one I reserve the right to reduce your overall course grade on paired projects down as far as zero if the evaluations you receive from your partners are consistently problematic e g if your partners report that you made no contribution If you re curious about how you re doing in the course I m happy to discuss your estimated grade at any time It s generally best to have this conversation in person so that we can explore issues other than just the raw numbers I m happy to have this conversation at any time that I m available and I m also glad to do it via email if we can t find a mutually available time Dropping the course or changing grade option Through the end of Week 2 Friday January 16 you may drop the course by simply going to WebReg and dropping it If you wish to drop the course after that date you will need to use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request a drop I do not have the final say over those ultimately as the Dean of the Bren School and your major if you are majoring in something outside of the Bren School must approve them It is not generally the case that an exception will be accepted simply because you re not doing well in a course though extenuating circumstances are certainly considered Similarly changing your grade option to Pass NotPass or back again can be done via WebReg through the end of Week 2 Friday January 16 after which you must use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request the change As with exceptional drops you must receive approval from the appropriate Deans and that approval is not guaranteed Academic honesty The policy As ICS 32 or CSE 42 students you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole Please take a few minutes to read the policies which can be found at this link All of your project work is expected to be completed solely by you and your partner on paired projects Working in larger groups and or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted Note that high level discussion of course material for better understanding is permitted and encouraged but when it comes time to sit down and write code that is expected to be done by you and you alone All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions even when there are superficial differences Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you and your partner on paired assignments you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else s work Academic honesty is a two way street Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted any more than turning in someone else s code Resist the temptation to give code to your friends for reference Based on my experience I can say that your friends may very well betray you and turn it in anyway and then you ll have a lot to answer for Naturally the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors registering for computing minors joining the ICS Honors Program and graduating from a computing major with honors The lesson Okay so the moral of the story is that it s wise to avoid cheating I believe that it s relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it why come to UCI if you re not planning to get something out of the coursework So why do people cheat every quarter in every course The answers vary but here s the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I ve had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years I fell behind and couldn t figure out how to catch up Things happen and ten week quarters are unforgiving You might get sick you might have issues crop up in your family you might have misunderstood one of the earlier topics in the course on which later topics dependend you might have an off campus job that s demanding too much of your time you might be trying to decide whether you re on the path you want to be on Any of those things and many others can make it hard to keep up You fall a little behind you fall a little further behind and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless You re under pressure temptation gets the better of you and suddenly it seems better to submit someone else s work than to submit nothing It s not If you feel like you re beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control the best thing to do is to talk to us sooner rather than later We re here to help we understand But the reality of taking large sized courses at a large sized institution is that we re not going to know you re in need unless you tell us If things are happening in your life tell us you don t have to be specific if you re not comfortable with it Before the fact there s often a way to work things out After the fact it s usually too late ", "_id":

We aren't ignoring you on purpose, but unfortunately it's not always possible for the relatively small course staff to answer questions from a large number of students at once.  A great way to mitigate this problem is to get started early and ask questions sooner in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Accommodations for disabilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any students who feel that they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss these specific needs.  Also, contact the Disability Services Center <a href=\"http://www.disability.uci.edu/\">online</a> or by phone at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations, such as alternative test-taking environments or note-taking services, can be arranged for you in a timely way.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Grading</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Weights of graded artifacts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your course grade will be determined from the weighted combination of your scores on each of six programming projects, one Midterm, and one Final Exam.  The weights of each of these are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Five programming projects, 40% (weighted equally at 8% each)</li>\r\n  <li>Midterm, 25%</li>\r\n  <li>Final Exam, 35%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Determining final grades</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Course grades will be determined neither on a normal curve nor a straight scale.  It is guaranteed that overall scores over 90% will receive an A- or better, scores over 80% will receive a B- or better, and scores over 70% will receive a C or better.  However, the actual cutoffs may be lowered at the end of the quarter.  In short, it is not my intention to fail half of the students, nor am I planning on giving only 2% of the students A's, but I prefer not to constrain myself with either a straight scale or a formalized curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the programming projects will ask you to employ a technique called pair programming, which is discussed in more detail in the <a href=\"ProjectGuide\">Project Guide</a>.  There are times that you will be required to participate in pair programming; there are other times when it will either be optional or disallowed.  Each of you will also be asked to fill out an evaluation of your partner after each paired project is due; this will give you an opportunity to let us know, confidentially, whether your experience with your partner was a positive one.  I reserve the right to reduce your overall course grade on paired projects down as far as zero if the evaluations you receive from your partners are consistently problematic (e.g., if your partners report that you made no contribution).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're curious about how you're doing in the course, I'm happy to discuss your estimated grade at any time.  It's generally best to have this conversation in person, so that we can explore issues other than just the raw numbers; I'm happy to have this conversation at any time that I'm available, and I'm also glad to do it via email if we can't find a mutually available time.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Dropping the course or changing grade option</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the end of Week 2 (Friday, January 16), you may drop the course by simply going to WebReg and dropping it.  If you wish to drop the course after that date, you will need to use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request a drop; I do not have the final say over those, ultimately, as the Dean of the Bren School (and your major, if you are majoring in something outside of the Bren School) must approve them.  It is not generally the case that an exception will be accepted simply because you're not doing well in a course, though extenuating circumstances are certainly considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, changing your grade option (to Pass/NotPass or back again) can be done via WebReg through the end of Week 2 (Friday, January 16), after which you must use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request the change.  As with exceptional drops, you must receive approval from the appropriate Deans, and that approval is not guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Academic honesty</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ICS 32 or CSE 42 students, you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole.  Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of your project work is expected to be completed <i>solely by you (and your partner, on paired projects)</i>.  Working in larger groups and/or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted.  Note that \"high-level discussion of course material for better understanding\" is permitted and encouraged, but when it comes time to sit down and write code, that is expected to be done by you and you alone.  All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system.  This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions, even when there are superficial differences.  <!--(Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter, so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in, or even refer to, code written by a friend of yours who took the course already.)--></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you (and your partner, on paired assignments), you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else's work.</p>\r\n\r\n<!--<p>You are not permitted to reuse code that you wrote along with a partner during a previous quarter.  You may only reuse code that you wrote on your own, and you may only reuse it for a project that is not paired this quarter.  (The reason for this rule is simply that I do not want students repeating the course to pair up with someone new and deprive them of the opportunity to work on the project.  Besides, if you're repeating the course, it's generally a good idea to start fresh, to solidify the ideas you missed the first time around.)</p>-->\r\n\r\n<p>Academic honesty is a two-way street.  Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted any more than turning in someone else's code.  Resist the temptation to give code to your friends \"for reference.\"  Based on my experience, I can say that your \"friends\" may very well betray you and turn it in, anyway, and then you'll have a lot to answer for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts.  Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy.  They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade.  Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The lesson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so the moral of the story is that it's wise to avoid cheating.  I believe that it's relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it; why come to UCI if you're not planning to get something out of the coursework?  So why do people cheat every quarter in every course?  The answers vary, but here's the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I've had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years: <i>I fell behind and couldn't figure out how to catch up</i>.  Things happen and ten-week quarters are unforgiving.  You might get sick, you might have issues crop up in your family, you might have misunderstood one of the earlier topics in the course on which later topics dependend, you might have an off-campus job that's demanding too much of your time, you might be trying to decide whether you're on the path you want to be on... Any of those things (and many others) can make it hard to keep up.  You fall a little behind, you fall a little further behind, and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless.  You're under pressure, temptation gets the better of you, and suddenly it seems better to submit someone else's work than to submit nothing.  It's not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel like you're beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control, the best thing to do is to talk to us <i>sooner rather than later</i>.  We're here to help; we understand.  But the reality of taking large-sized courses at a large-sized institution is that we're not going to know you're in need unless you tell us.  If things are happening in your life, tell us; you don't have to be specific if you're not comfortable with it.  Before the fact, there's often a way to work things out.  After the fact, it's usually too late.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 10432.0}
