Generally speaking, each constituent of\n&gt; configuration layers may have different version schemas and numbers.  For\n&gt; example, version 3 of an entire document consists of version 4 of\n&gt; a component and version 5 of another component.\n\nThis is the idea brought up by Marty in the message\n&lt;<a href=\"mailto:9605291632.AA0573@ccmnotes1.cwi.com\">9605291632.AA0573@ccmnotes1.cwi.com</a>&gt; and by Jim in his proposal\non versioning, where he proposes the new content type\ntext/config.  In the long run this functionality is critical,\nespecially for researchers who will want to cite Web documents,\nand need to ensure that the reader is reading the same document\nthat the author of a paper wrote  (see the 4th edition of the MLA\nmanual for writers of research papers for more rationale; I,\nunfortunately, left mine at home today).\n\n- David\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0036.html\">Scot Malloy: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0034.html\">David J.
