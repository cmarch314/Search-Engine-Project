They provide a mechanism for expressing\nthe visibility polygon from a point as the disjoint union of\nlogarithmically many canonical pieces using a quadratic-space data\nstructure. This results in a query time proportional to the size of\nvisibility polygon but without cubic space overhead of earlier methods.\n<p>\nBy exploring the connection between visibility polygons and shortest-path\ntrees, the authors obtained a kinetic algorithm that can track the visibility\npolygon as the viewpoint moves along polygonal paths inside a simple\npolygon. The combination of the static and kinetic algorithms leads to a\nnew static algorithm in which the authors trade off space for increased\noverhead in the query time.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3628.0}
