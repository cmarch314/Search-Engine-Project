{"text": "Scott Jordan Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of California Irvine CS 132 Project Forming a group and choosing a topic due May 6 Please choose a topic that focuses on a networking technology and or on a networking application You should not focus exclusively on a technology at OSI layer 1 If you choose an application that lies at OSI layer 7 you should relate it to other standardized application layer protocols and or relate it to requirements at lower layers You cannot cover material covered in lecture Your project will consist of learning about the topic and presenting what you have learned You are not expected to build or design anything You should work in a group of two three or four students If you are looking for other students to work with you might want to post to the CS 132 MessageBoard By May 6 your group should post information about your proposed project on the course wiki Please include the names of the students in your group a project title and a short one paragraph description of your topic The description need not describe everything you will investigate but it should be enough to give me an idea of what will be included and what is outside the bounds of your interest Learning about your topic You should find and read information related to your topic This information should be composed of a few independent sources You can use any source paper or online that you deem respectable Here are a few magazines that I believe are generally reliable to give you a few examples IEEE SpectrumIEEE Communications MagazineIEEE Network MagazineIEEE Personal Communications MagazineCommunications of the ACM UCI has online subscriptions to these and many other publications To take advantage of this you must either use a computer on the UCI campus or use the UCI VPN A reasonable amount of information would probably be 3 5 articles from these magazines or a corresponding amount from other sources Initial Report due May 2 Write a 1 2 page report explaining the scope of your project Include an initial list of your references Turn in the report by May 2 7pm Only one member of your group should do the following If your report is in a

are presenting Your talk should use a set of computer projected slides You may use either ppt or pdf formats You may use your own laptop or you may use the computer in the classroom You should practice your talk to learn the timing as I will cut you off when you have used 15 minutes Although 15 minutes might seem like a long time you will not have time to present everything you have learned Therefore you should decide what you think is the most important information for your classmates YOU MUST INCLUDE ON YOUR LAST SLIDE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF YOUR INFORMATION SOURCES Please include the

to your classmates For presentations we will assign scores for preparation how well did you demonstrate that you know the material content which material did you include in your presentation presentation how well did you communicate this information to your classmates and length how closely did you match the 15 minute target For reports we will assign scores for preparation how well did you demonstrate that you know the material content which material did you include in your report and presentation how well did you communicate this information Scott Jordanlast modified August 28 2
