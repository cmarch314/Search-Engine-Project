We show that this approach can be implemented efficiently when the sampled variables constitute a cycle-cutset for the Bayesian network and otherwise it is exponential in the induced-width of the network's graph, whose sampled variables are removed. Cutset sampling is an instance of the well known Rao-Blakwellisation technique for variance reduction investigated in [5, 2, 13]. Moreover, the proposed scheme extends standard sampling methods to non-ergodic networks with ergodic subspaces. Our empirical results confirm those expectations and show that cutset sampling is superior to Gibbs sampling for a variety of benchmarks, yielding a simple, yet powerful sampling scheme.\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<A href=\"r102.ps\"><b>PostScript</b></a> \r\n<A href=\"r102.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8639.0}
