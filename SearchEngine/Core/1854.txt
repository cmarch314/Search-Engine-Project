{"text": "Algorithms for Graphs on Surfaces Investigators David Eppstein University of California Irvine Michael Goodrich University of California Irvine Roberto Tamassia Brown University There are number of interesting questions concerned with algorithms for graphs on surfaces Indeed examples of such geometric graphs include planar convex hulls Voronoi diagrams Delaunay triangulations line arrangements visibility graphs polygon triangulations and Euclidean minimum spanning trees which collectively form the backbone of the topics in computational geometry This work studies algorithms for graphs such that the vertices are points in a geometric space and the edges are curves that are embedded in a surface that is itself embedded in that space In particular this project is focused on algorithms for graphs on surfaces directed at the following three thrust areas Algorithms for Embedding Graphs on Surfaces This is the study of methods for producing geometric configurations from a combinatorial graph Topics of interest in this thrust area include methods for approximate minimum genus embedding of graphs algorithms for manifold triangulation for a set of points sampled from an embedded surface and techniques for drawing trees in the plane which are of interest in the visualization of hierarchies such as organization charts and object oriented class hierarchies Algorithms for Graphs Embedded on Surfaces This is the study of graph algorithms that take advantage of additional structure available for graphs embedded on surfaces Topics of interest in this thrust area include the study of connections between partial cubes and integer lattices the development of algorithms for graphs embedded in Non Euclidean spaces such as hyperbolic spaces and the design of methods for solving graph problems on quadrilateral meshes which arise in surface modeling and animation applications Applications of Algorithms for Graphs on Surfaces This is the study of applications of algorithms that are specialized for graphs on surfaces Topics of interest include applications of geometric graphs to computer graphics computer security greedy geometric routing in
