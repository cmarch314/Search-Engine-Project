{"text": "Building a Better Beam Detector A beam detector for the unit circle is a set of points that intercepts all lines crossing that circle As we will see it need not be a connected subset of the plane The task is to find the beam detector with minimum one dimensional measure The detectors we ll discuss are made up of curves and line segments so this measure is just the total length I first came across this problem in 1986 when Bill Thurston posted a message about it to sci math and soon exchanged correspondence on the subject with him and others including Andrew Odlyzko Thurston s original message described a beam detector in the shape of a bow and arrow one circumscribes the circle by a square extends a quarter circle by line segments to two opposite square corners the bow and drops a half diagonal from the remaining corner to the center of the figure the arrow This detector is drawn below and has total length pi 2 2 sqrt 2 approximately 4 985 Thurston also included a proof based on the theory of measures on spaces of lines that the length of any beam detector must be at least pi The point of his message was to ask for better lower bounds My response to this message was to modify this bow and arrow basing it on a hexagon instead of a square It soon became clear that others had looked at modified bow and arrow beam detectors including E Makai who had published in 198 a construction with length 4 8189 He later noted that one of the segments forming an end of the bow can be separated and tilted to form another arrow making a very small further improvement Since then several articles have appeared on the subject of opaque forests This is apparently the same idea as that of a beam detector with three changes First the detector is explicitly required to be a forest set of line segments Second the set of lines that must be detected is that crossing some particular polygon rather than a circle And third the detector must be contained entirely within that polygon This third restriction changes the problem completely for the circle all boundary points would have to be part of such a forest and the total length would be 2 pi Some early works on this subject assumed that generalizations of the bow and arrow idea gave the correct solution but T Shermer in 1991 showed that in some cases one can find a better opaque forest by keeping everything connected computing a Steiner tree My latest but half baked idea for a beam detector combines the hexagon bow and arrow and Steiner tree Start with a hexagon ABCDEF circumscribing the circle Connect vertices ABDE with a Steiner tree Finally drop a line segment from the remaining two vertices C and F to the nearest side of quadrilateral ABDE But for the regular hexagon illustrated below this produces a beam detector with total length 2 sqrt 3 4 approximately 5 1547 not bad but worse than the bow and arrow Thanks to John Rickard for the length I initially miscalculated this value to be 4 464 I suspect but have not calculated that non regular hexagons can be used to improve this value even further but maybe that would still not be enough to get a better beam detector The latest news in Scientific American is of a constructor by J Day with length 4 7998 but this is not much of an improvement on Makai s bound and looks like it may be the same as Makai s old two arrow improvement Is

<A HREF=\"1986.html\">exchanged correspondence</A> on the subject with him\nand others including Andrew Odlyzko.\nThurston's original message described a beam detector\nin the shape of a \"bow and arrow\": one circumscribes the\ncircle by a square, extends a quarter-circle by line segments to two opposite square corners (the \"bow\"), and drops a half-diagonal from the remaining corner to the center of the figure (the \"arrow\").\nThis detector is drawn below, and has total length\npi/2 + 2 + sqrt(2), approximately 4.985.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"bow-arrow.gif\" WIDTH=300

least pi.\nThe point of his message was to ask for better lower bounds.\n\n<P>\n\nMy response to this message was to modify this bow and arrow,\nbasing it on a hexagon instead of a square.  It soon became\nclear that others had looked at modified bow-and-arrow beam detectors,\nincluding E. Makai, who had published in 1980 a construction with length\n4.8189.\nHe later noted that one of the segments forming an end of the \"bow\"\ncan be separated and tilted to form another \"arrow\", making\na very small further improvement.\n\n<P>\n\nSince then, several articles have appeared on the subject of \"opaque\nforests\".  This is apparently the same idea as that of a beam detector,\nwith three changes.  First, the detector is explicitly required to be a\nforest (set of line segments).  Second, the set of lines that must be\ndetected is that crossing some particular polygon, rather than a circle.\nAnd third, the detector must be contained entirely within that polygon.\nThis third restriction changes the problem completely;\nfor the circle, all boundary points would have to be part of such\na forest, and the total length would be 2 pi.\nSome early works on this subject assumed that generalizations of the bow-and-arrow idea gave the correct solution, but T. Shermer in 1991 showed\nthat in some cases one can find a better opaque forest by keeping everything connected (computing a <I>Steiner tree</I>).\n\n<P>\n\nMy latest (but half-baked) idea for a beam detector combines the\nhexagon, bow and arrow, and\nSteiner tree.  Start with a hexagon ABCDEF circumscribing the circle.\nConnect vertices ABDE with a Steiner tree.\nFinally, drop a line segment from the remaining two vertices C and F\nto the nearest side of quadrilateral ABDE.\nBut for the regular hexagon (illustrated below),\nthis produces a beam detector with total length 2/sqrt 3 + 4,\napproximately 5.1547, not bad but worse than the bow and arrow.\n(Thanks to John Rickard for the length; I initially miscalculated this value\nto be 4.464.) I suspect (but have not calculated) that\nnon-regular hexagons can be used to improve this value even further,\nbut maybe that would still not be enough to get a better beam detector.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"newbeam.gif\" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=344\nALT=\"New beam detector\"></CENTER><P>\n\nThe latest news in Scientific American\nis of a constructor by J. Day with length 4.7998,\nbut this is not much of an improvement on Makai's bound,\nand looks like it may be the same as Makai's old two-arrow improvement.\nIs there a better beam detector?\n<P>\nReferences:\n<UL>\n<LI>V.
