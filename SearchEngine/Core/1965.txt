{"text": "Were you expecting something worthwhile up here News Papers Research Schedule TA Resources Courses Interests People Grad School Cisco Clean Access Contact me Various Interests As everyone can imagine I do have a handful of interests This page seeks to highlight a few of them and perhaps even point people off to various resources that would interest others who are interested in similar stuff Theoretical Computer Science Theoretical Computer Science interests me which is why I am doing graduate work in it I took and passed the Phase II s aka qualifiers on May 21 2 4 My advisor David Eppstein is doing his best to keep me focused on research activities but goodness are there many things to work on Research Interests Literally too many to enumerate but here are a couple that may be interesting to others Set data structures and algorithms both ordered and unordered worked from mid April 2 4 to late May 2 4 with preliminary research for a survey paper but was redirected to the precursor to The Weighted Maximum Mean Subtree and Other Bicriterion Subtree Problems Adaptive Lossless Data Compression I have done some minor work in the Winter of 2 3 research indicated that compression better than bzip2 is possible with the algorithm I developed though is very slow more research would likely result in a faster algorithm with comparable compression Python I m also interested in programming for fun and profit with the Python programming language For most everything that I ve done since the spring of 2 Python has been the way I ve made it happen Right now I have two projects that have been released to the masses PASP Python Anti Spam Proxy a bayesian like spam filter similar in functionality to SpamBayes and Popfile PASP is a little short on features and rough around the edges but it is what I use and of the 1 spams I get per day only around 1 2 get through it 1 82 downloads between October 2 2 and April 2 4 PyPE Python Programmer s Editor a multi tabbed editor with syntax highlighting for a few languages Just the right amount of editor for me 9 72 downloads between July 2 3 and April 2 4 And one commercial product which is backed by as of September 2 5 around 3 k lines of Python I ve also written a PEP that was rejected quite spectacularly My three favorite links on the whole deal are here 1 2 3 though in my defense I did not whine when it was rejected I could tell it was coming In any case the PEP was the culmination of my desire to give symbolic maximum and minimum values to Python I have a handful of recipes in the online ASPN Python Cookbook and was given a free copy of the 2nd edition of O Reilly s publishing of the Python Cookbook which I read through in three days Strangely enough I was credited as part of the discussion in the Fifo queue implementation After the Fifo queue portion they offered a way to change the Fifo implementation into an LRU with O n overhead per update They didn t bother to include my O 1 LRU implementation which has been around since the at the latest summer of 2 2 I discussed it with some professors the fall of 2 2 because I hadn t seen it previously available posted on the internet since December of 2 3 in PyPE and used by me in the spring of 2 4 in an OS memory paging simulation on top of Simplesim 3 for a processor architecture design course Se la vi There was a partial asynchronous translation of the SimpleHTTPServer in Python over in the cookbook which I made completely asynchronous except for block reads from the disk while serving files of unlimited size and added some command line options so it could be a simple web server for most people My senior capstone project for my undergraduate degree was written in Python I ve been paid a reasonable amount of money to develop software in Python and wxPython for a company by the name of Next Gen Aeronautics though they lack a web presence as of this writing April 27 2 4 I ve also previously worked for Affini run by William Chang former chief architect of Infoseek May 2 4 2 7 Currently I work at Networks In Motion as a backend server developer working with their routing engine and related systems When I get the time I read and post to the comp lang python newsgroup aka the python list mailing list hopefully to help people I m used to lurk on the python dev mailing list occasionally posting when someone says something particularly deserving of a response In my spare time I sometimes write utilities and scripts for personal use From socket servers and clients to various GUI utilities in wxPython of course I have written well over 3 programs that are as of yet unreleased though a surprising number of them end up giving me the functionality of various nix shell utilities that I am missing in Windows that I don t know the name of Yes I do know about cygwin More recently I ve been spending more and more time with friends trying to relax Some day I hope to release a MUD written in Python to the masses I m up to version 4 or 5 on one I started the summer of 2 2 I usually get a bit farther every summer because that s when I usually have time but if tthe last couple summers are any indication it will never be done Politics This is a bit confusing but I m really not interested in politics If things were going right no one should be interested in politics and no one should have to pay attention to politics at all Unfortunately the world is as I see it messed up I m tired of pointing fingers at people who have caused the problems and I would like for things to get better The only way for me to make a difference is to pay attention to what is going on and point out the stupid shit that happens every day The first step towards the world getting better is that people need to start telling the truth No more lies I m tired of hearing X thinking that it sounded fishy then discovering 6 12 months later that X was a lie crafted to misdirect people away from fact Y and the course of action caused by X being called the truth resulting in an outcome that is only good for the people who told X and their financial supporters You want to know my political affiliation I m all for politicians who tell the truth No spin no tactics no bullshit just truth When politicians lie believably then we can t make educated decisions about what we want and they get what they want which for liars in politics usually means their friends get money that they don t deserve Tell the truth If you have to lie to get people to agree with you about subect Z or the course of action to deal with Z then your position obviously isn t holding water It s OK to be wrong admit it people will think the better of you for it Games During my undergrad career I occasionally was in attendance of a game of D D or several Fun was had by all I sometimes still do on occasion but nothing regular as of late I used to play quite a few console and computer games From Civilization 3 to Half Life original Opposing Force Blue Shift 2 Episode 1 to Worms to Fallout on the PC side of things to Metroid Prime Katamari Damaci FFX Amplitude Worms 3D Breath of Fire III Castlevania Symphony of the Night Metroid Fusion Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga etc on the console side of things I don t get much time to play video games anymore though I occasionally play a quick game of Civ 3 Other Stuff I do have other interests and when I have a chance or an idea of what to say about them I ll post it here News Papers Research Schedule TA Resources Courses Interests People Grad School Cisco Clean Access
