Horizontally partitioned\ncaches help reduce cache pollution and thereby improve\nperformance. Consequently most previous research has\nfocused on exploiting horizontally partitioned data caches to\nimprove performance, and achieve energy reduction only as\na byproduct of performance improvement. In constrast, in\nthis paper we show that optimizing for performance tradesoff\nseveral opportunities for energy reduction. Our experiments\non a HP iPAQ h4300-like memory subsystem demonstrate\nthat optimizing for energy consumption results in up to\n127% less memory subsystem energy consumption than the\nperformance optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that\nenergy optimal solution incurs on average only 1.7% performance\npenalty. Therefore, with energy consumption becoming\na first class design constraint, there is a need for compilation\ntechniques aimed at energy reduction. To achieve\naforementioned energy savings we propose and explore several\nlow-complexity algorithms aimed at reducing the energy\nconsumption and show that very simple greedy heuristics\nachieve 97% of the possible memory subsystem energy savings.\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Center For Embedded Computer Systems,<br> \n      Department of Information and Computer Science,<br>\n      University of California, Irvine.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "id": 16883.0}
