He came up with a 14-sided\nspace-filling polyhedron with 6 square sides and 8 hexagonal sides.\nThe faces have to curve a bit where they meet to form the proper\nsoap film angles.  Now Denis Weaire (<A HREF=\"mailto:dweaire@vax1.tcd.ie\">dweaire@vax1.tcd.ie</A>) and\nRobert Phelan (<A HREF=\"mailto:rphelan@alice.phy.tcd.ie\">rphelan@alice.phy.tcd.ie</A>) of Trinity College, Dublin,\nhave beaten Kelvin.  The Weaire-Phelan structure uses\ntwo kinds of cells, a dodecahedron and a tetrakaidecahedron\nwith 2 hexagons and 12 pentagons.  The surface area is 0.3% less\nthan the Kelvin structure, which is a whopping big amount to all\nof us who have tried to beat Kelvin over the years.\n\nThe Weaire-Phelan structure has cubic symmetry, and the fundamental\nregion is a 2x2x2 cube.  The 8 cells start as Voronoi cells on centers\n\n                0   0   0\n                1   1   1\n                0.5 0   1\n                1.5 0   1\n                0   1   0.5\n                0   1   1.5\n                1   0.5 0\n                1   1.5 0\n\nThere are two dodecahedra (centered at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1)) and six\ntetrakaidecahedra. The cells must be adjusted a bit to get exactly equal\nvolumes, and the faces must curve a bit to get the proper soap film angles.\nThe tetrakaidecahedra stack on their hexagonal faces to form three sets\nof perpendicular interlocking columns, with the interstices filled\nby the dodecahedra.\n\nKen Brakke\n<A HREF=\"mailto:brakke@geom.umn.edu\">brakke@geom.umn.edu</A>\n</PRE>\n", "id": 11017.0}
