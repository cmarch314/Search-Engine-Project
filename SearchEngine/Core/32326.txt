and website while trying to research my family tree My name is Michelle Neiman and I live in Akron Ohio I have been desperately seeking information concerning my grandmother whose maiden name was Langsam My grandmother s name was Anna Langsam who married William Neiman Wolf Neumann She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman and died three weeks later at approximately age 24 in 1926 I have been unable to find any information concerning her as anybody who could have given me information has since passed I have never even been able to locate her grave which is somewhere in Pittsburg The only information I have is that the family lived in the Pittsburg area and moved to San Francisco after a flood devastated their furniture business probably the St Patrick s Day Flood of 1936 Anna s brothers were Paul Philip and Sam She also had a sister named Rose I don t have any additional information so I don t know if I fit somewhere into the descendants of Pesach or not I would be grateful for any information you have concerning my grandmother or any of her siblings I have checked many websites including ancestry com and familysearch org but I haven t gotten any good leads Thank you for

death certificate because she actually died here in Akron The only information the death certificate provided was that her body was returned to Pittsburgh by hearse I found that unusual since most travel was by train back then No one in the family seems to know where she could be buried It is no small task since there are about 4 jewish burial areas in the Pittsburgh area I have looked 3 4 times to narrow the search Some are actually just a few headstones in between houses I will keep looking I may also try to find her marriage record since that might indicate the congregation she belonged to which might help narrow my search From Michelle Neiman Date Mon 26 Jul 2 4 16 5 4 To Once again I want to thank you for the information I really can t express what it means I am named after my grandmother my middle name is Langsam so I have searched a long long time to find out something about my family You have handed me the missing pieces Anna Langsam married William Neiman aka Wolf Neumann They lived in Akron Ohio She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman on July 1 1926 and died 22 days later on July 23 1926 She was buried in Pittsburg somewhere supposedly with her mother and an aunt I have never been able to locate the graves but I have renewed hope now My grandfather remarried third wife actually Anna was the second wife The new wife was also called Anna Together they had four more children my father s half siblings My father Harold Neiman married Hazel Casey Kline I am one of three daughters Karyn Lynne Neiman born 1963 Lori Ann Neiman born 1965 died 1988 I am Michelle Langsam Neiman born 1967 My sister also lives in Akron and is married to John Goldsmith They have two daughters Allison and Victoria I barely remember both my older and younger aunt roses who used to visit us in Akron Ohio We also visited them in San Francisco at the apartment building on Funston Street It is good to hear that the younger Rose is still living but it is my understanding that she does not want to hear from my part of the family and has been reluctant to share family history in the past so I don t think I will travel down that road I am very excited to continue my

This inquiry is especially interesting to me as I \r\nremember Gladys Henerson vaguely from Temple Sinai in Oakland. I really\r\ndidn't know her, but her husband, Morris, was my religious school teacher\r\none year. You mentioned a son Stan. I remember their older son, James.\r\n\r\nMorrie Henerson was also the executive director of Temple Sinai, so I just\r\nphoned the Temple office. They connected me to the cemetery. Gladys is\r\nburied at Home of Eternity, 500 Piedmont Avenue, Oakland 94611.\r\nThe woman I spoke with (Rhonda) said they do not have any info on\r\nGlady's parents.  And since Temple Sinai is reform, I have a feeling\r\nthat there may not be any Hebrew on the gravestone.\r\nI told the woman that I had known the family, and she said that she did, too.\r\nI said I remembered their son, Jimmy. She said, \"We're in touch in with\r\nJimmy.\" I said I went on the web and got 2 southern Calif. addresses for\r\nJames Henerson. She said, \"Oh, from the film website?\" I said no, from\r\ntelephone listings. She said she couldn't reveal the address. I said which\r\none do you like best , Santa Barbara or Sherman Oaks? She said,\"Sherman\r\nOaks.\"  So here is Jimmy's address and Phone:\r\n\r\nJames Henerson\r\n15300 Kingswood Lane\r\nSherman Oaks, CA 91403\r\n\r\nPhone # 818-981-5893\r\n\r\nI did a web search, and James is apparently a writer for some TV shows\r\nand various films.\r\n\r\nIf you phone him, you can mention my name (and my brother Don Rubin)\r\nif you wish, though I don't think he would remember me. I think he's about\r\n4 years younger than I am. I'm 68. Maybe it's best not to mention that \r\nRhonda told me which town. Just say I remembered the name James,\r\nand that I (or you) did a web search for Calif. James Henersons.\r\n\r\nI'll find out the address to get the death certificate.\r\n\r\nI'll really be interested to know if I was sitting in synagogue with an einicle\r\nof Rebbe Elimelech! Even as a young child, I felt the connection with the ages.\r\n\r\nFor maybe a year, Irwin Spira was director of the religious school. At the\r\ntime I had no knowledge of the significance of the name Spira.

I never had much interest in my family's geneology, \r\nbut I find as I grow older - I'm 66 - my interest has grown.

I think \r\nshe had three brothers, David, Sam and Jack, all of whom have long \r\nsince passed on.  Dave had off-spring, but Sam and Jack died \r\nbachelors.  I knew Mark Langsam and his second wife, and if memory \r\nserves, my mother considered him her first cousin.  For that to be \r\ntrue, however, Mark would have had to be the brother of the \r\naforementioned David, Sam and Jack - and I don't think that was the \r\ncase.   \r\n\r\nAnyway, I would be happy to help you in any way I can, but I have \r\nthe feeling that what I just wrote amounts to the sum total of my \r\nknowledge.   \r\n\r\nBest regards,] \r\n\r\nJim Henerson   \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nDate: Sat, 02 Nov 2002 22:05:13 -0500\r\nTo: HENERSON@aol.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Langsam geneology\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply and words of interest.

My name is Michelle Neiman and I live in Akron, Ohio. I \r\nhave been desperately seeking information concerning my grandmother \r\nwhose maiden name was Langsam.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother's name was Anna Langsam who married William Neiman \r\n(Wolf Neumann). She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman and died \r\nthree weeks later at approximately age 24 in 1926. I have been \r\nunable to find any information concerning her, as anybody who could \r\nhave given me information has since passed. I have never even been \r\nable to locate her grave which is somewhere in Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe only information I have is that the family lived in the \r\nPittsburg area and moved to San Francisco after a flood devastated \r\ntheir (furniture) business-probably the St. Patrick's Day Flood of \r\n1936. Anna's brothers were Paul, Philip and Sam. She also had a \r\nsister named Rose. I don't have any additional information, so I \r\ndon't know if I fit somewhere into the descendants of Pesach, or \r\nnot. \r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any information you have concerning my \r\ngrandmother or any of her siblings. I have checked many websites \r\nincluding ancestry.com and familysearch.org but I haven't gotten any \r\ngood leads. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com [mailto:moishe@langsam.com] \r\nSent: Monday, July 26, 2004 2:50 PM\r\nTo: Michelle Neiman\r\nSubject: H4 Langsam family\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nTonight begins the Jewish fast of \"Tisha B'Av\" (the ninth\r\nday of Av), which marks the destruction of both Temples in\r\nJewish History.

I really can't\r\nexpress what it means. I am named after my grandmother-my middle \r\nname is Langsam-so I have searched a long, long time to find out \r\nsomething about my family. You have handed me the missing pieces!\r\n\r\nAnna Langsam married William Neiman aka Wolf Neumann. They lived in\r\nAkron, Ohio. She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman on July 1, \r\n1926 and died 22 days later on July 23, 1926. She was buried in \r\nPittsburg somewhere supposedly with her mother, and an aunt. ( I \r\nhave never been able to locate the graves but I have renewed hope \r\nnow.) My grandfather remarried (third wife actually, Anna was the \r\nsecond wife!) The new wife was also called Anna. Together they had \r\nfour more children-my father's half-siblings. \r\n\r\nMy father Harold Neiman married Hazel \"Casey\" Kline. I am one of \r\nthree daughters: Karyn Lynne Neiman born 1963, Lori Ann Neiman born \r\n1965, died 1988. I am Michelle Langsam Neiman born 1967.\r\n\r\nMy sister also lives in Akron and is married to John Goldsmith. They \r\nhave two daughters-Allison and Victoria. \r\n\r\nI barely remember both my older and younger \"aunt\" roses who used to \r\nvisit us in Akron, Ohio. We also visited them in San Francisco at \r\nthe apartment building on Funston Street. It is good to hear that \r\nthe younger Rose is still living but it is my understanding that she \r\ndoes not want to hear from my part of the family and has been \r\nreluctant to share family history in the past, so I don't think I \r\nwill travel down that road.\r\n\r\nI am very excited to continue my family research. You have opened \r\nmany doors! I will try to call you one evening this week to speak in \r\nperson, and that will give you a day or two to update the family \r\ninformation. I am eternally grateful. Thanks again. Take care. \r\n  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com [mailto:moishe@langsam.com] \r\nSent: Tuesday, July 27, 2004 10:22 AM\r\nTo: Michelle Neiman\r\nSubject: Re: PA Death Records\r\n\r\nWhat are the names of her parents on her death certificate?\r\nWhat other info is there on it?\r\n\r\nMoishe  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Michelle Neiman\" <mneiman@cpcourt.summitoh.net> \r\nSubject: RE: PA Death Records \r\nDate: Tue, 27 Jul 2004 11:08:22 -0400 \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n \r\n\r\nI will have to check with my sister.
