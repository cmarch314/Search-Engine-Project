However the complex and \r\n    dynamic nature of these architectural and micro-architectural techniques \r\n    renders them intractable for exploitation by conventional compiler \r\n    technology. Our research attempts to model and exploit these dynamic \r\n    mechanisms within such processors during the process of code generation. We \r\n    investigate compilation strategies for&nbsp; performance, power and code size, \r\n    while allowing for exploration and evaluation of different \r\n    micro-architectural features.</font><p align=\"justify\">\r\n    <strong><font size=\"1\">References:</font></strong><font size=\"1\"><br>\r\n    A.

SRAM-based FPGAs are becoming popular for HW \r\n    implementation and design sizes are increasing very rapidly. In this \r\n    context, there is a need to investigate efficient and scalable partitioning \r\n    and scheduling algorithms that do a very rapid and high-quality exploration \r\n    of the design space. One key feature of modern FPGAs is dynamic \r\n    reconfiguration where the hardware configuration can be changed dynamically \r\n    to obtain better performance at lower hardware cost. While this is a very \r\n    powerful feature,&nbsp; it introduces a lot of architectural constraints on \r\n    the system. We are developing a number of partitioning and scheduling \r\n    algorithms to generate high-quality results in the context of multiprocessor \r\n    SOCs.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <strong>References:</strong><br>\r\n    S.

Key challenges in DRE system \r\n    developments include safe composition of system components and mapping the \r\n    functional specifications onto the target platform. Model-based technologies \r\n    help address these issues by enabling design-time analysis and providing the \r\n    means for the rapid evaluation of design alternatives with respect to \r\n    end-to-end QoS properties, predictability and performance measures before \r\n    committing to a specific platform. The Distributed Real-time Embedded \r\n    Analysis Method DREAM \ufffd is an open-source tool and method for optimizing \r\n    multiple quality of service (QoS) properties of distributed real-time \r\n    embedded (DRE) systems. The project focuses on the practical application of \r\n    formal analysis methods to real-time middleware to automate the \r\n    verification, development, configuration, and integration of \r\n    middleware-based DRE systems.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <strong>Reference:</strong><br>\r\n    G.
