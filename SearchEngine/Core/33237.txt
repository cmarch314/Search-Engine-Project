This discussion has highlighted an important requirement Versions should be extractable from the URL Just Say No I ll read the rest in detail later but I ll just say now that I think this is a fatal flaw Compare with MIME types should be extractable from the URL The web as it exists today is proof that this is not necessary There are plenty of ways to ship the appropriate metainformation around so that this can be avoided Sure we could use HTTP headers but I think that we should have a way to GET a particular version of an object As I say later I think that it s not unreasonable to expect that one should be able to inspect URLs to determine that they are different versions of the same document Given the fact that resource versions affect referential integrity while MIME types modification dates and other meta data do not it seems that there is evidence that a version is part of the identification of a resource and not just information about it I don t want to question the feasibility of using HTTP headers and additional specialized requests to accomplish version identification but I don t see the need to require an extra set of HTTP transactions that must be done in order for a version aware browser to decide how to follow a link As Larry M said the flip side is given a URL A and a version V there should be a standard way to combine them into a new URL A such that GETting A yields version V of A This flip side is reasonable I m not so sure I don t see why we need to create more URL aliasing to handle versions Also what happens if I use the recipe on a URL A that already specifies version V of A in the server s private notation If the URL s version information is completely opaque this cannot be prevented I was going to ask what happens if we apply the recipe to A but we can define the syntax to prevent that Another way to put it web clients have a standard way to construct query URLs from the address of the search service and the search terms On the other hand there is no standard way to do the reverse look at a URL and determine what it means to the origin server After I read your earlier attempt to kill the discussion of version identification in the URL I read the Genericity notes by TimBL I was not convinced by the notion of equating genericity of representation the examples were mime type and language and genericity of time which seems that it should properly include version For one thing a translation of a resource from one language or data format to another is an am attempt em to create a set of equivalent resources However it is not the case that different revisions of a document are intended to be equivalent but rather that they are hostorically related It is the complexity of the relation that actually obtains between revisions that makes versioning systems useful Obviously I don t set design strategy for the WWW but I m not sure that version really meets the criteria for genericity Of course there are only examples of genericity given and no explicit definition or criterion so I can t say that for sure Here s a definition that I think makes sense A is generically related to B iff A and B are intended by an information provider to be equivalent for differing users or user agents If genericity is to be an absolute requirement of the W3C for any URL proposals perhaps it should be defined I don t want to founder on a religious issue if the W3C will rule URL version information right out I m willing to accept extra mandatory use of HTTP operations to find out any version information I assume that others would too But I think that the justification for that if there is to be one is not yet clear David David Durand dgd cs bu edu david dynamicDiagrams com Boston

If\nthe URL's version information is completely opaque, this cannot be\nprevented.
