normal part of the development of IETF protocols is revision based on operational experience from deployed implementations This document is a revised version of RFC 2518 the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol The WG intends for this document to become a Draft Standard specification Currently at Internet Draft revision 4 July 1 2 3 Advanced Collections Binding Extensions to WebDAV G Clemm J Crawford J Reschke J Whitehead Issues List A protocol for creating bindings to resources A binding is a referential containment relationship between a collection and a resource named by a URL path segment like weather html By making a new binding to a resource the resource can have multiple URLs mapped to it Thus bindings act somewhat like hard links in file systems WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources Jim Whitehead Geoff Clemm Julian Reschke Last Call Issues List A protocol for creating redirect resources A redirect resource responds to most HTTP methods with an HTTP 3 2 redirection response This protocol allows such resources to be remotely created and administered Requirements for Advanced Collection Functionality in WebDAV Judith Slein Jim Davis This draft sets out requirements for more advanced optional collection functionality beyond that supported by the distributed authoring protocol specification It extends the base functionality in two general directions support for referential members and support for ordered collections Though several years old this document still provides a good overview of rationale for advanced collections capabilities Currently
