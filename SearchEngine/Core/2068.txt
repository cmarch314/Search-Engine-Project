geographic features such as\nroads, buildings, mountains... These systems can be used for making\nmaps, but also for analyzing data e.g. for facility location.  There has\nbeen some communication between the geometry and GIS communities (e.g.\ngeographer Michael Goodchild gave an invited lecture on \"Computational\nGeography\" at the <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/contributions/snoeyink/acm-scg.html\">11th\nACM Symp.

Geographic problems already visible in the geometry community\ninclude <A HREF=\"interpolate.html\">interpolation of surfaces from scattered data</A>,\noverlaying planar subdivisions, hierarchical representations of\nterrain information, boundary simplification,\nlossy compression of elevation data (e.g. by using a piecewise linear\napproximation with few facets), and map labelling.  Other\ninteresting geometric issues include handling of approximate and\ninconsistent data, matching similar features from different databases,\ncompression of large geographic databases, cooperation between raster\nand vector representations, visibility analysis, and generation of\ncartograms (maps with area distorted to represent other information such\nas population).\n\n<P>A particularly important geometric data structure in geographic\nanalysis is the <A HREF=\"voronoi.html\">Voronoi diagram</A>, which has been\nused for to identify regions of influence of clans and other population\ncenters, model plant and animal competition, piece together satellite\nphotographs, estimate ore reserves, perform marketing analysis, and\nestimate rainfall.\n<P><UL>\n<LI>ACM Int.
