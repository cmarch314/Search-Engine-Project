For an arbitrary\ndual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of\norientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a\nrectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The\nalgorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a\ngiven dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's\nrepresentation theorem for distributive lattices.\n<p>\nMerged with \"<a href=\"p-area-universal.html\">Area-universal rectangular layouts</a>\"\nto form the journal version, \"<a href=\"p-aucrl.html\">Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts</a>\".\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/cartograms.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
