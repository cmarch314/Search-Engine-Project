{"text": "ICS 6D Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Winter 2 15 Dillencourt From the UCI Catalog Covers essential tools from discrete mathematics used in computer science with an emphasis on the process of abstracting computational problems and analyzing them mathematically Topics include mathematical induction combinatorics and recurrence relations Although ICS 6B is not listed as a prerequisite this background will be assumed and we will only give a cursory review of the ICS 6B material This web page is a work in progress Information will be added incrementally asthe quarter progresses Class meetings Lecture MWF 9 9 5 AM in SSLH 1 Prof Dillencourt Discussion Sections MW 1 1 5 PM in MSTB 118 Mr Tajik MW 4 4 5 PM in PCSB 12 Mr Tajik MW 5 5 5 PM in ICS 174 Ms Forouzmand MW 6 6 5 PM in ICS 174 Ms Forouzmand There will be no class on the following days Monday January 19 Martin Luther King Jr Day Monday February 16 Presidents Day Class attendance You should plan on attending class regularly If you are unable to do this because of a regularly occurring conflict your best strategy is to drop the class and take it some quarter when you will be able to attend The slides used in lecture will be posted They are intended as a supplemental aid not as a substitute for attending class There will be things said in class that are not in the lecture notes and will not be posted on the class web page Examples of this may include Questions from students and their answers Additional examples applications Nuanced interpretations of material on the slides Errors on the slides that are discovered in class I try to fix these after class but this is not guaranteed to be a perfect process Remarks to the effect that this topic is really important or this topic will not be on the quizzes or the final Announcements of precisely what a particular quiz will cover Announcements concerning the grading curve Announcements of how to access the class notes Announcements that the office hour immediately after class has been cancelled or moved or otherwise changed Other announcements You are responsible for all material covered in class and all announcements made in class If you have to miss a class please ask a classmate to fill you in on what you missed If you are not attending class regularly ask yourself the following questions Who is paying my tuition and fees Do they know that I am not attending class How would they feel about it if they knew Instructor Professor Michael Dillencourt Email dillenco at ics dot uci dot edu But please read the section on class email below Office hrs I am available immediately after class for questions After class ends if there are questions I usually move the discussion to outside the door near the podium front of classroom to my right and your left My official office hours are 1 3 11 3 MWF in DBH 4 86 I try to be there then but sometimes I step out for a few minutes and sometimes there are unexpected exingencies that result in a last minute cancellation of an office hour To avoid the inconvenience of showing up unexpectedly at my office and finding that I am not there please note If for some reason I have to miss an office hour I will announce it in class If you are planning on coming to my office hour please let me know after class If I know someone is coming I will be sure to be there Teaching Assistants Mr Hossein Tajik Email tajikh at ics dot uci dot edu But please read the section on class email below Office hours Tuesday 2 3 and Thursday 4 5 DBH 3 13 Ms Elmirasadat Forouzmand Email forouzme at uci dot edu But please read the section on class email below Office hours Tuesday 1 12 DBH 4 69 Reader Mr Reza Asadi Email rasadi at uci dot edu But please read the section on class email below Office hours TBA Prerequisites and assumed background Although ICS 6B is not a formal prerequsite for this course we will assume that you are familiar with the material from the first three chapters of the textbook This material is covered in detail in ICS 6B We will review the first three chapters of the textbook during the first week The review will proceed at a pace that should be fine if it is truly a review However it may seem quite rushed if you have not seen the material before or if your knowledge of it is rusty I recommend that you review the first three chapters in the textbook before the first class If portions of it are not familiar to you you should do the related online activites in the textbook Unlike the rest of the material from the textbook that I will be assigning during the quarter this material is optional in the sense that I will not be tracking whether you have done the online activites for the first three chapters If you find that you are having difficulty with the first three chapters I strongly recommend that you drop ICS 6D take ICS 6B first and then take ICS 6D at a later time after you have studied this material in ICS 6D Grading Final Exam 46 Quizzes 48 Reading Assignments Interactive Exercises 6 Final Exam Wednesday Mar 18 8 1 AM in the same room where the lecture is held Quizzes There will be 5 quizzes given at 2 week intervals The dates are Quiz 1 Wednesday January 14 Wednesday of week 2 Quiz 2 Wednesday January 28 Wednesday of week 4 Quiz 3 Wednesday February 11 Wednesday of week 6 Quiz 4 Wednesday February 25 Wednesday of week 8 Quiz 5 Wednesday March 11 Wednesday of week 1 Quiz coverage Generally the material covered on a quiz will be the material up through and including the material to be covered the week prior to the quiz on the list of topics For example Quiz 1 is given during week 2 so the material to be covered would be the material listed up through week 1 which is Sections 1 1 1 5 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 4 from the text The focus of each quiz will be on the material covered more recently but there may be questions from material earlier in the quarter More nuanced announcements to the effect that certain topics will be skipped and other topics will be emphasized may be given in class If you want to hear these announcements your best strategy is to attend class regularly Quizzes will be given in lecture The quizzes are anticipated to take 3 4 minutes each On quiz days there may be a short lecture followed by the quiz However this is not a guarantee If you show up late for class on a quiz day and miss some or all of the quiz no special allowances will be made No make up quizzes will be given no matter how valid your reason for missing the quiz The lowest quiz score will be dropped If you miss a quiz you will receive a zero on that quiz If this quiz is the only one you miss it will be the one that is dropped If you have to miss a quiz please plan to do well on the others If you miss more than one quiz special arrangements will be made only if both of the following conditions hold There are documentable and compelling circumstances for each missed quiz Note you need a good reason for missing all of them including the first one you missed If the reason for missing any of the quzzes was something you know about in advance you asked and received my permission in advance If these two conditions do not hold I will drop one of the missed quizzes and you will receive a zero on all the other quizzes that you missed If these conditions do hold special arrangements will consist of weighting the final more when computing your grade As I stated above I will not give a makeup quiz under any circumstances Regrade requests After your graded quiz has returned if you think we made an error on the grading submit a regrade requests Please follow the instructions guidelines given here Reading Assignments Each section in the online textbook contains some activities which serve to reinforce the material For each assigned section you will receive points for completing the activities by the due date for reading that section The due dates can be found by following links in the list of topics below Of course there is no reason to wait for the deadline to complete the reading We recommend that you keep a log of when you finish the activites in each section If you have not received credit for finishing an assignment it is because the Zyante software tells us you have not completed it If you think this is an error contact Zyante support Their email address is in the textbook section of this web page If you are having trouble keeping track of which activities you have completed this link may be helpful As noted above the readings for week 1 review of relevant material from ICS 6B is not required The required readings are the readings starting with week 2 Homework Weekly homework assignments will be posted here The homework will not be collected or graded The solutions will be discussed in the discussion sections The homework assignments are a tool that you can use to help you learn the material If you diligently attempt the problems reviewing the relevant portions of the text and your notes along the way you will most likely learn the material well If you choose to not do the homework problems or to only make a half hearted attempt to do them you are only cheating yourself Textbook We will be using the online web based textbook Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sandy Irani You are required to subscribe to the book if you are enrolled in the class The material includes interactive exercises which will count as a small portion of your grade Directions for subscribing are included below Please note the following If you have already subscribed to this book in the last year for another class ICS 6B or a previous offering of ICS 6D you still need to subscribe again but you can receive a 5 discount To receive the discount send email to support zyante com In this email be sure to tell them The email address for your zybooks com account The ZyBook code to which you were previously subscribed The ZyBook code to which you wish to subscribe this term see below Here are the directions for subscribing Sign up at zybooks com Enter zyBook code UCIICS6DWinter2 15 Click Subscribe Send email to support zyante com if you have problems accessing the web site or other questions of comments A recommended supplementary text is the book Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Kenneth H Rosen any edition is fine This book is not required but you may find it useful It has a large number of homework exercises with answers to all the odd numbered exercises Enrollment issues All adds and drops are handled by the WebReg system Adding the class The class is full As students drop during the first two week of classes students at the front of the wait list will be automatically added Please do not ask me to override this mechanism by adding you to the class If you ask me to do this in person I will say no If you ask me to do this via email I will ignore your email Dropping the class The deadline to drop the course is the end of week 2 Friday January 16 The deadline is imposed by the UCI Registrar not by me Note on email The Teaching Assistants and I will make every effort to answer all course related email promptly and to give helpful answers You can help us do this by following these simple guidelines All email with questions about course material should be sent to the address ics6d questions uci edu This is an alias for the instructor the TAs and the Reader Sending your question here ensures that all of us see your message and the response It may also give you better turnaround time Please include the string ICS 6D at the beginning of the subject line This ensures that your email will successfully pass through our spam filter and be flagged as a course related message Please make the rest of your subject line descriptive In particular please do not just reply to a message we send out to the entire class If we read your message and need to think about it or check something before replying we can find your message quickly if the subject has something to do with the content of the message If your message has a meaningless subject line such as Re ICS 6D Course announcement we may not be able to find your email and you may not receive a response Please include your name and student number in the message If you are not sending from your UCI account please include your UCI ID as well If you do not comply with the above requests you run the risk that we will not see your email and hence will not get a reply or that there may be a delayed reply Course announcements Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled in the class The announcements will be set to your UCI email address All students enrolled in this course have a UCI email address If you have not set up your UCI email account you can do so at the UCI Office of Information Technology Email page If you are not receiving these announcements for some reason you can view the archive here Question and answer forum We will be using the Piazza question and answer forum Although posters can hide their identity from other students the instructor and the teaching assistants are able to determine the identity of posters The forum is intended as an open and respectful forum for the exchange of questions and answers about the class and the course material Inappropriate insulting or offensive posts will not be tolerated Such posts will be deleted and may result in the suspension or termination of access to the forum In extreme cases offensive posts may be referred to other University entities for appropriate disciplinary action Academic Dishonesty Academic dishonesty cheating is a serious offense in the eyes of the instructor the instructional assistants ICS and the university Incidents of academic dishonesty will usually result in your receiving a grade of F in the course and not being allowed to drop the course Additional consequences may occur at the academic unit or campus level Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to Copying from others during an examination communicating exam answers with other students during an examination or using unauthorized materials during an examination Allowing another student to copy off your work during an examination Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected then returning it for more credit Forging add drop change cards and other enrollment documents or altering such a document after signatures have been obtained Intentionally disrupting the educational process in any way For more complete information about academic honesty policies consult the UCI Academic Senate Policy on Academic Honesty and the Academic Honesty Policy for Information Computer Science Class Notes Will consist of slides used in class and perhaps other information as well Not everything I say will be in the notes In fact major topics may be omitted You are responsible for all material from class and from the text whether they appear in the class notes or not Access to class notes is restricted to students enrolled in the class Click here to access the class notes When you click the link authentication will be required Authentication information will be discussed in class List of topics Schedule of topics and readings for weeks 7 through 1 Sections 9 3 and forward Schedule of reading deadines for week 5 and earlier
