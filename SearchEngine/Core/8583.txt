The goal of the research is to develop algorithms which\r\nare effective on large and hard constraint satisfaction problems.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dissertation presents several new combination algorithms. The BJ+DVO\r\nalgorithm combines backjumping with a dynamic variable ordering heuristic that\r\nutilizes a forward checking style look-ahead. A new heuristic for selecting a value\r\ncalled Look-ahead Value Ordering (LVO) can be combined with BJ+DVO to yield\r\nBJ+DVO+LVO. A new learning, or constraint recording, technique called \r\njumpback learning is described. Jump-back learning is particularly e\u000bective because it\r\ntakes advantage of e\u000bort that has already been expended by BJ+DVO. This type\r\nof learning can be combined with either BJ+DVO or BJ+DVO+LVO. Learning\r\nis shown to be helpful for solving optimization problems that are cast as a series\r\nof constraint problems with successively tighter cost-bound constraints. The \r\nconstraints recorded by learning are used in subsequent attempts to \fnd a solution\r\nwith a lower cost-bound.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"R69.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"R69.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8583.0}
