Previous\r\nwork showed the tremendous gain obtained by exploiting problem's\r\ndecomposition (using AND nodes), equivalence (by caching) and irrelevance\r\n(via the power of lower bound heuristics). In this paper,\r\nwe show the additional improvements that can be gained by bringing\r\ntogether all the above, as well as diverse refinements and optimizing\r\nprinciples such as exploiting determinism via constraint propagation,\r\nusing good initial upper bounds generated via stochastic local search\r\nand improving the quality of the guiding pseudo tree. We illustrate\r\nour results using a number of benchmark networks, including the\r\nvery challenging ones that arise in genetic linkage analysis.\r\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r162.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8412.0}
