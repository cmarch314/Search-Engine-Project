undergraduate degree Degree Available Major The Computer Game Science CGS major combines a solid foundation in computer science with a focus on designing building and understanding computer games and other forms of interactive media The fundamentals of information and computer science along with coursework in mathematics statistics physics and film and media studies provide students with the concepts and tools to study a wide scope of computer game technologies CGS emphasizes design teamwork and the understanding of computer games and related technologies and media in a social and cultural context The term computer game includes games that run on cell phones mobile devices PCs consoles Macs web pages and even inside automobiles CGS majors design and create games for entertainment and also for education training and social change The study of computer games is an emerging field driven by advancing computer hardware and software technology the widespread popularity of video games as an entertainment medium and by the interest of artists economists educators scientists and many others to use game technologies for communication visualization computation and learning Is Computer Game Science for me CGS is ideal for anyone interested in learning the technical components of creating games computer programming graphics network design database management artificial intelligence and much more and working in teams to design and implement exciting new games If you are primarily interested in the art or management sides of creating games the CGS major may not be the best fit for you Students who major in Computer Game Science will acquire a solid foundation in computer science and software development learn how to create interactive and human centered computer game designs employ an interdisciplinary approach to computer game design and development drawing on coursework in modeling and design graphics software engineering hardware architectures AI algorithms distributed systems human interfaces and aesthetics be able to analyze and discuss computer game systems as communication teaching and entertainment media that can be a force for education social change and activism graduate with an extensive portfolio of implemented games Back to top Why study at UC Irvine Several factors contribute to the strength of UC Irvine s Computer Game Science program including Overall excellence Ranked 28th nationally by U S News and World Report computer science education at UCI is broad deep and cutting edge Location Irvine and Orange County are home to a remarkable concentration of game development studios large and small including industry giant Blizzard Entertainment We consulted with these companies many of which employ or were founded by UCI alumni while planning the CGS major and they look forward to offering internships and jobs to our students Collaboration We partner with nearby Laguna College of Art and Design which offers a Game Art major Their student artists work with our CGS students to develop innovative visually engaging games Back to top What courses do I take The CGS major combines the fundamentals of computer science with about a dozen game focused courses A full listing of the major requirements can be found in the General Catalogue Students are encouraged to consult an academic advisor in the Bren School of ICS to determine the coursework designed to meet their educational goals What can I do with a degree in CGS A wide variety of careers and graduate programs are open to Computer Game Science graduates The video game industry is comparable in size to the film and music industries and job growth projections are excellent for people with strong technical backgrounds Many other fields including mobile software development interactive entertainment and training and education software have demand for similar skill sets and knowledge CGS graduates are well trained in computer science and can thus pursue graduate programs or any career that involves designing implementing evaluating or interacting with computer based systems Back to top Still not sure Prospective and current UCI students

The fundamentals of information and \ncomputer science &#8212; along with coursework in mathematics, statistics, physics, \nand film and media studies &#8212; provide students with the concepts and tools to \nstudy a wide scope of computer game technologies. \n</p>\n<p>\nCGS emphasizes design, teamwork, and the understanding \nof computer games and related technologies and media in a social and cultural \ncontext. The term &#8220;computer game&#8221; includes games that run on cell phones, \nmobile devices, PCs, consoles, Macs, web pages and even inside automobiles. \nCGS majors design and create games for entertainment, and also for education, \ntraining and social change.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe study of computer games is an emerging field driven by advancing computer \nhardware and software technology, the widespread popularity of video games as \nan entertainment medium, and by the interest of artists, economists, \neducators, scientists and many others to use game technologies for \ncommunication, visualization, computation and learning.\n</p>\n<a href=\"../ICS/ics/ugrad/degrees/degree_cgs#startcontent\"></a>\n<h4>Is Computer Game Science for me? </h4>\n<p>\nCGS is ideal for anyone interested in learning the technical components of\ncreating games &#8212; computer programming, graphics, network design, database\nmanagement, artificial intelligence and much more &#8212; and working in teams to\ndesign and implement exciting new games. If you are primarily interested in\nthe art or management sides of creating games, the CGS major may not be the\nbest fit for you.\n</p>\n<p>\nStudents who major in Computer Game Science will:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"content-list-large\">\n<li>acquire a solid foundation in computer science and software development;\n      </li>\n<li>learn how to create interactive and human-centered computer game designs;\n      </li>\n<li>employ an interdisciplinary approach to computer game design and development,\n          drawing on coursework in modeling and design, graphics, software engineering,\n          hardware architectures, AI, algorithms, distributed systems, human interfaces\n          and aesthetics;\n      </li>\n<li>be able to analyze and discuss computer game systems as communication,\n          teaching and entertainment media that can be a force for education, social\n          change and activism;\n      </li>\n<li>graduate with an extensive portfolio of implemented games.\n   </li>\n</ul>\n&#8593;<a href=\"../ICS/ics/ugrad/degrees/degree_cgs#startcontent\">Back to top</a>\n<h4>Why study at UC Irvine? </h4>\n<p>\nSeveral factors contribute to the strength of UC Irvine&#8217;s Computer Game Science program, including:\n   </p>\n<ul class=\"content-list-large\">\n<li><strong>Overall excellence.</strong> Ranked 28th nationally by U.S.\n          News and World Report, computer science education at UCI is broad,\n          deep and cutting-edge.\n      </li>\n<li><strong>Location.</strong> Irvine and Orange County are home to a\n          remarkable concentration of game development studios large and small,\n          including industry giant Blizzard Entertainment. We consulted with\n          these companies (many of which employ or were founded by UCI alumni)\n          while planning the CGS major, and they look forward to offering\n          internships and jobs to our students.\n      </li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> We partner with nearby\n          <a href=\"http://www.lagunacollege.edu/\">Laguna College of Art and Design</a>,\n          which offers a Game Art major. Their student artists work with our\n          CGS students to develop innovative, visually engaging games.\n   </li>\n</ul>\n&#8593;<a href=\"../ICS/ics/ugrad/degrees/degree_cgs#startcontent\">Back to top</a>\n<h4>What courses do I take?</h4>\n<p>\nThe CGS major combines the fundamentals of computer science with about a dozen\ngame-focused courses. </p>\n<p>A full listing of the major requirements can be found in the <a href=\"http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/#computergamesci\">General Catalogue</a>.</p>\n<p>Students are encouraged to consult an academic advisor \nin the Bren School of ICS to determine the coursework designed to meet \ntheir educational goals.</p>\n<h4>What can I do with a degree in CGS? </h4>\n<p>\nA wide variety of careers and graduate programs are open to Computer Game\nScience graduates. The video game industry is comparable in size to the film\nand music industries, and job growth projections are excellent for people with\nstrong technical backgrounds. Many other fields, including mobile software\ndevelopment, interactive entertainment, and training and education software,\nhave demand for similar skill sets and knowledge. CGS graduates are well\ntrained in computer science, and can thus pursue graduate programs or any\ncareer that involves designing, implementing, evaluating or interacting with\ncomputer-based systems.\n</p>\n<a name=\"special\"></a>\n&#8593;<a href=\"../ICS/ics/ugrad/degrees/degree_cgs#startcontent\">Back to top</a>\n<h4>Still not sure? </h4>\n<P>\r\nProspective and current UCI students interested in learning more about the Bren School\u2019s degree \r\noptions are encouraged to meet with the school\u2019s associate dean of student affairs, counselors and \r\nstudent ambassadors.
