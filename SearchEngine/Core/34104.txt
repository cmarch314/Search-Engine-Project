The lab is structured around exercises that highlight topics such as addressing, subnetting, bridging, ARP, routing (RIP, OSPF), TCP, ICMP, etc. The course consists of 8 weeks of lab experiments. Every week a series of exercises are required to be completed. Lab reports are used to evaluate the students' understanding of the material and document the exercises. Students are required to review ICS 153 material for each lab. An accompanying text will be used and for each exercise the relevant chapters will be given.</P>\n\n<P><B>Prerequisites</B>: ICS 153 (a strict requirement!)</P>\n\n<P><B>Required Text</B>: A Guide to the TCP/IP Prtocol Suite by Floyd Wilder, Artech House, 2nd edition, ISBN: 0-89006-976-X</P>\n\n<P><B>Reference Text</B>: TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1, by W.
