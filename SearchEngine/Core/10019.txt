Out of the Cube Aurora Bedford Aurora Bedford knew she wanted to major in computer science but she didn t want to churn out code or work with computer hardware building During her visit to UCI the Pomona native saw some presentations on the Informatics major from Professor Andre van der Hoek and was hooked I was immediately interested as it appeared to be computer science for people who were interested in the human aspect of computers not just hardware stuff Bedford said The Informatics major covers the design implementation use and impact of information technology Compared to traditional computer science which primarily focuses on the internal features of computer systems Informatics is also concerned with computer systems and their surrounding context the people and organizations that use them and the problems they need to solve AN INTERESTING MAJOR Bedford is a member of the second class of Informatics majors which made her a little nervous since she would still be part of an experiment to see if the major would be a success However it also gave her a source of pride and an incentive not to fail I believe that Informatics is a great program and I want to prove that its students will learn a lot from this field of study and succeed after graduation Bedford said Hear Aurora s story in her own words and be sure to check out our YouTube page to watch more student profiles So far her most interesting Informatics class has been Seminar in Informatics Research The class is composed completely of guest Informatics faculty who speak about what research they are currently conducting It was really interesting to get to know most of the faculty in Informatics and get to hear about all the different areas of research going on in Informatics Bedford said The variety of research was amazing no two professors were doing anywhere near similar things Graduation is still two years away but her experience thus far in the Informatics major has helped her get a better picture about her career after UCI I hope to work in either consulting or some aspect of software development something that will enable me to talk to people about what they want their software to accomplish and working with them to achieve their goals Bedford said SPREADING THE WORD Bedford recommends the major for those who are interested in the management or development side of the computer science which entails a lot of interaction with people and working in teams If you do not enjoy meeting new people or communicating with others this may not be the major for you Bedford said However if you are interested in how an idea and becomes a reality then studying Informatics will show you all the work that goes into software development Bedford is so passionate about Informatics she joined the Informatics Student Association INSA where she is currently the Treasurer Check out our spotlight page to read more profiles of Bren School students faculty and alumni INSA puts together numerous events for Informatics and other Bren School majors such as company visits resume and interview workshops and events with company representatives to talk about what their company does and how student can prepare for a job with them She is also a Community Programmer in Middle Earth undergraduate housing community which has provided her a chance to interact with first year residents and will be a resident advisor next year in Mesa Court I have great respect for those that do these jobs and look forward to being a good role model for younger students and making a positive impact in their lives Bedford said I also love being a part of the student staff community as they are all very fun interesting and caring people Despite her rather hectic schedule Bedford finds time to dabble in the social experience of college life by going to hockey games visiting museums and aquariums and going to concerts Irvine is a wonderful place to live as it is a very safe community and there are a lot of places to hang out such as Irvine Spectrum The Lab the beach Fashion Island and many more Bedford said I love it here Eric Kowalik More community

Bedford said. </p>\n<p>The Informatics major  covers the design, implementation, use and impact of information technology.  Compared to traditional computer science, which primarily focuses on the  internal features of computer systems, Informatics is also concerned with  computer systems and their surrounding context -- the people and organizations  that use them and the problems they need to solve.</p>\n<p><strong>AN INTERESTING MAJOR </strong></p>\n<p>Bedford is a member of the second class of Informatics  majors which made her a little nervous, since she would still be part of an  experiment to see if the major would be a success. </p>\n<p>However, it also gave her a  source of pride and an incentive not to fail.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe that Informatics  is a great program and I want to prove that its students will learn a lot from  this field of study and succeed after graduation,&#8221; Bedford said. </p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\">\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Y6DmYaMTLpg\"/><embed height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Y6DmYaMTLpg\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100\"/></object>\n<p>Hear Aurora's story in her<br/> \nown words, and be sure to <br/>\ncheck out our <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/UCIBrenICS\">YouTube page</a><br/> \nto watch more student profiles.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>So far her most interesting  Informatics class has been Seminar in Informatics Research. The class is  composed completely of guest Informatics faculty who speak about what research  they are currently conducting. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really interesting  to get to know most of the faculty in Informatics, and get to hear about all  the different areas of research going on in Informatics,&#8221; Bedford said. &#8220;The variety of research was  amazing--no two professors were doing anywhere near similar things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Graduation is still two  years away but her experience thus far in the Informatics major has helped her  get a better picture about her career after UCI. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope to work in either  consulting or some aspect of software development, something that will enable  me to talk to people about what they want their software to accomplish, and  working with them to achieve their goals,&#8221; Bedford said. </p>\n<p><strong>SPREADING THE WORD </strong></p>\n<p>Bedford recommends the major for those who are interested  in the management or development side of the computer science, which entails a  lot of interaction with people and working in teams. </p>\n<p>&#8220;If you do not enjoy  meeting new people or communicating with others, this may not be the major for  you,&#8221; Bedford  said. &#8220;However, if you are interested in how an idea and becomes a reality,  then studying Informatics will show you all the work that goes into software development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bedford is so passionate about Informatics she joined the  <a href=\"http://www.clubs.uci.edu/insa\">Informatics Student Association (INSA)</a> where she is currently the Treasurer. </p>\n<div class=\"highlight_box_left\">\n<a href=\"index.php\">Check out our spotlight page</a> to read more profiles of Bren School students, faculty and alumni.\n</div>\n<p>INSA puts together numerous  events for Informatics, and other Bren School majors, such as company visits,  resume and interview workshops, and events with company representatives to talk  about what their company does and how student can prepare for a job with them. </p>\n<p>She is also a Community  Programmer in Middle Earth undergraduate housing community which has provided  her a chance to interact with first year residents and will be a resident  advisor next year in Mesa Court. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I have great respect for  those that do these jobs, and look forward to being a good role model for  younger students and making a positive impact in their lives,&#8221; Bedford said. &#8220;I also love  being a part of the student staff community, as they are all very fun,  interesting, and caring people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite her rather hectic  schedule Bedford  finds time to dabble in the social experience of college life by going to  hockey games, visiting museums and aquariums, and going to concerts. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Irvine  is a wonderful place to live, as it is a very safe community and there are a  lot of places to hang out, such as Irvine Spectrum, The Lab, the beach, Fashion Island  and many more,&#8221; Bedford  said. &#8220;I love it here.&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>- Eric Kowalik</i></p>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"><div id=\"sidebar_title\">More community &#187;</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../../alumni/index.php\">Alumni</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../friends/index.php\">Friends</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.parents.uci.edu/\">Parents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../friends/leadershipcouncil/index.php\">Leadership Council</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../index.php\">News</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ua-web.uadv.uci.edu/eGiving/\">Give a gift</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> |\n   <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a> |\n   \n   <!-- <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/sitemap.php\">Site Map</a> | -->\n \n  <a href=\"mailto: i%63%73%77%65%62m%61s%74%65r@%69c%73%2e%75c%69%2eedu\">icswebmaster</a></div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "id": 10019.0}
