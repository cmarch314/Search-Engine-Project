{"text": "US 3 DAVID G KAY UC IRVINE WINTER 2 14 Assignments Each Thursday after class we ll post an assignment here for the following week Week 2 due January 16 Read Chapters and 1 of the Linguistics Wikibook Stabler 1 and 11 Feel free to follow up on Piazza with questions and comments But note that we ll spend time in class next week talking about phonetics the subject of Chapter 1 Also the authors may address or emphasize things that just aren t important for what we re doing That means you shouldn t worry if small passages aren t crystal clear don t spend a lot of time on those passages and we can discuss on Piazza or in class whether it s important to understand them further There s no written assignment for this week Week 3 due January 23 Read Chapters 2 and 3 of the Linguistics Wikibook Stabler 12 13 and 2 These are the topics we ll get to after phonetics Choose a language you know other than English It doesn t matter how well you know it Let s call it Language X Write down three different consonant sounds of the sort we talked about in class that Language X has but English doesn t have For each sound give an example of a word or phrase in Language X that contains the sound and try to describe the sound in the articulatory phonetics terms we covered in class Typically that woud include a point of articulation like bilabial or palatal and a manner of articulation like voiced stop or voiceless fricative So the sound z is an alveolar voiced fricative Take a look at this animated pronunciation head that illustrates the various points of articulation Week 4 due January 3 Read Chapter 4 of the Linguistics Wikibook There s another free linguistics text that you might prefer it s Lecture Notes Linguistics by Edward Stabler I ve indicated the corresponding chapters above the chapters that correspond for this week are 3 through 7 All these readings should provide some background for what we do in class you should look over the indicated chapters in at least one of the texts but you should not feel obligated to read them in great detail There s no written assignment for this week Week 5 due February 6 There s nothing additional to read for this week use the opportunity to catch up or study for your midterms You may do the written part of this assignment by yourself you may also do it with one or two partners because you may learn something more by discussing the problems If you work with partners turn in one paper copy with everyone s name at the top If there are four of you split into two groups of two Here is a phrase structure grammar like the one we looked at in class It describes an extremely limited subset of English Each line is a rewrite rule it says that the item to the left of the arrow can be rewritten as the item s to the right of the arrow Thus the first line says that S for sentence can be rewritten as NP for noun phrase followed by VP for verb phrase The vertical bar means or so the last line says that V can become ate or chased or saw We use the typewriter font to indicate terminal symbols that could occur in the language as part of the final sentence i e that can t be rewritten because they don t occur on the left side of any grammar rule S NP VP NP Art N VP V NP Art a the this that N cat dog mouse V ate chased saw a Write three varied sentences that this grammar produces That is start with S and keep rewriting symbols according to the grammar s rewrite rules until all you have are terminal symbols English words that can t be rewritten any further This isn t the same as just assembling sentences out of the listed words b Write two Engish sentences that this grammar does not produce but that it could produce if the definitions of Art N and V were expanded That is come up with sentences that don t require any structural change to the grammar but just require new words in the existing categories c Write two English sentences that this grammar could not produce even if all the words in the sentence were included in the definitions of Art N and V d Does this grammar really describe a subset of English That is is every sentence it can generate acceptable to most English speakers If it can generate any sentences that are not part of English then the grammar does not describe a subset of English if you think this is the case give an example of such a sentence The grammar above is finite We could list all the possible sentences in the language it describes With one small addition the grammar below is infinite as all natural languages are infinite S NP VP NP Art N NP Conj NP VP V NP Art a the this that Conj and or N cat dog mouse V ate chased saw e Write two sentences that this grammar produces but the first grammar doesn t which means you ll use the second alternative for NP at least once Week 6 due February 13 There s nothing additional to read for this week use the opportunity to catch up or study for your midterms I saw the man in the park with a telescope That sentence is ambiguous It could mean I viewed the man through the telescope while I was in the park it could also mean I viewed the man while I was in the park that has a telescope i e an observatory List at least two additional distinct meanings of this sentence there are at least a dozen Consider each meaning you come up with carefully Be sure it s really a meaning of the sentence and be sure you write it down clearly and unambiguously so it won t be confused with other meanings Week 7 due February 2 Take a look at these items The Wikipedia chart Distribution of languages in the world North American English Dialects page just browse around George Booth s cartoon Ip Gissa Gul from The New Yorker January 2 1975 Try to translate what the cavemen say into normal English If the link doesn t work just Google Ip Gissa Gul Take the New York Times American Dialect Quiz If possible print out the final page Your map or at least write down which three cities it thinks match your linguistic background Also write down whether you think the result is accurate or surprising and if surprising feel free to take a guess about why I doubt this quiz was designed for people whose first language isn t English but it will still be interesting to see what it produces in that case Put your name on it and turn it in Week 8 due February 27 Read Chapter 1 of the Linguistics Wikibook When you speak to a professor in class or in office hours you speak in a certain way You use certain words certain grammatical structures and so on Write down at least one other different situation in which you speak a different kind of English different vocabulary different grammar perhaps different pronunciation even if it s not very different and give at least two examples of something you d say differently in the two situations Week 9 No class on March 6 due March 13 There s no formal class meeting on March 6 because I ll be out of town But show up Thursday at 1 anyway to work on the Cryptography Group Exercise I handed out If you form a group and your group chooses to meet at a different time and place that s okay but if you haven t made other arrangements show up at the usual time Turn in your probably joint solution on March 13 David G Kay kay uci edu Friday February 28 2 14 7 47 AM", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/us3/hw.html", "title": "us 3

If you work with partners, turn in one paper copy with everyone's name at the top.  If there are four of you, split into two groups of two.\n <p>Here is a phrase-structure grammar like the one we looked at in class.  It describes an extremely limited subset of English. Each line is a \"rewrite rule\"\u2014it says that the item to the left of the arrow can be rewritten as the item(s) to the right of the arrow. Thus, the first line says that S (for &quot;sentence&quot;) can be rewritten as NP (for &quot;noun phrase&quot;) followed by VP (for &quot;verb phrase&quot;).  The vertical bar means &quot;or&quot; (so the last line says that V can become &quot;<code>ate</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>chased</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>saw</code>&quot;.  (We use the <code>typewriter font</code> to indicate &quot;terminal symbols&quot; that could occur in the language as part of the final sentence (i.e., that can't be rewritten because they don't occur on the left side of any grammar rule).)<br />\n S \u2014&gt; NP VP<br />\n NP \u2014&gt; Art N<br />\n VP \u2014&gt; V NP<br />\n Art \u2014&gt; <code>a</code> | <code>the</code> | <code>this</code> | <code>that</code><br />\n N \u2014&gt; <code>cat</code> | <code>dog</code> | <code>mouse</code><br />\n V \u2014&gt; <code>ate</code> | <code>chased</code> | <code>saw</code>\n <p>(a) Write three varied sentences that this grammar produces.\n (That is, start with S and keep rewriting symbols, according to the grammar's rewrite rules, until all you have are &quot;terminal symbols&quot; (English words) that can't be rewritten any further. This isn't the same as just assembling sentences out of the listed words.)</p>\n <p>(b) Write two Engish sentences that this grammar does not produce, but that it <em>could</em> produce if the definitions of Art, N, and V were expanded. (That is, come up with sentences that don't require any structural change to the grammar, but just require new words in the existing categories.)</p>\n <p>(c) Write two English sentences that this grammar could not produce even if all the words in the sentence were included in the definitions of Art, N, and V.</p>\n <p>(d) Does this grammar really describe a subset of English?
