{"text": "APBS 4 User Guide Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver PreviousOverviewNext Other tools APBS contains a number of tools to facilitate the preparation of APBS runs and analysis of the results NOTE In addition to the tools provided with APBS there are a number of other programs which interoperate with our code Please see the Other Programs section of this manual for more information Parameterization Unfortunately the majority of problems encountered during electrostatics calculations arise in process of taking a structure from the Protein Data Bank and transforming into a file that can be used by the APBS software The PDB2PQR service was orginally developed in conjunction with Jens Nielsen and Andy McCammon to address these issues The service has since evolved and has been completely rewritten by Todd Dolinsky and Nathan Baker PDB2PQR is able to Fill in missing atoms in the PDB within reason Add hydrogens to the structure to optimize the hydrogen bonding network Calculate side chain pKasAssign charges and radii according to one of the following force fields CHARMM23 AMBER 2 or PARSEReturn the results in PQR format Please visit the PDB2PQR home page http pdb2pqr sourceforge net for more information links to available servers and download options Additionally APBS provides the ability to read plain PDB format files and assign charges and radii from user supplied parameter files These features are described in the READ PARAM command description Finally APBS provides a few other miscellaneous tools for converting and parameterizing structures tools conversion qcd2pqr awkConvert a QCD file UHBD format for a molecule to PQR format tools conversion amber2charmm shA script which converts a PDB file with AMBER atom names to a PDB file with CHARMM atom names Useful for preprocessing files before converting with pdb2pqr tools conversion WHATIF2AMBER sedA sed script for converting a PDB file with WHATIF atom names to a PDB file with AMBER atom names Useful for preprocessing files before converting with pdb2pqr Contributed by Chiansan Ma Problem setupIn addition to parameterization of the molecule there are several common operations which are performed to setup the calculation This section reviews some of the tools available for these operations The following scripts help generate or transform APBS input files tools manip psize pyGet the dimensions and center of a molecule in PQR format Very useful for setting up input files i e grid dimensions lengths spacings etc for APBS calculations Written by Todd Dolinsky and Nathan Baker apbs tools manip inputgen pyGenerate an APBS input file from PQR format data using suggested parameters Also can decouple a parallel calculation into a series of sequential asynchronous

OpenDX format data from APBS Written by Nathan Baker Data visualizationThis section describes the data visualization tools provided with APBS A more complete discussion of the various ways to visualize APBS output is presented in the Visualization section of this manual tools visualization vmdThis directory contains scripts which facilitate the visualization of APBS data with VMD NOTE As described in the Visualization section a much more elegant interface has been developed for APBS and is available from the VMD plugins page The version distributed with APBS was written by Nathan Baker and Dave Sept based on example Tcl scripts by John Stone The file loadstuff vmd is the command file to be modified to the users tastes and loaded into VMD The file read dx contains the Tcl functions needed to read the APBS output tools visualization opendxThis directory contains the OpenDX program files net required to visualize APBS data with OpenDX In particular one can visualize single file potential isocontours pot single file potential data mapped onto molecular surfaces potacc or multiple file potential data multipot Solvent accessibilityWe provide a simple program tools manip acc which calculates molecular volumes surface areas and other surface based properties from PQR format structural data Such calculations are often used to determine apolar solvation contributions to binding events etc This program has a number of options which can be viewed by running acc with no arguments Coulomb s Law and Generalized Born calculationsThese utilities are provided for occasional use and are definitely not optimized for speed NOTE Many of these tools will be incorporated into the main APBS executable during upcoming releases Coulomb s Law calculationsThe program tools manip coulomb calculates vacuum Coulomb law energies from a PQR file It has a number of options which can be viewed by running the coulomb program with no arguments Generalized Born calculationsThe program tools manip born is a crude non optimal buggy program are you still reading for calculating Generalized Born electrostatic energies This is only intended for hacking and general comparison with Poisson Boltzmann results Eigenvalue analysistools arpack driverIf APBS is linked with ARPACK see configure help this routine will perform eigenvalue analyses of matrices produced by APBS Python development toolsThere are a number of example Python tools and wrappers provided in the tools python directory These tools all make use of the APBS SWIG wrappers developed by Todd Dolinsky Nathan Baker Alex Gillet and Michel Sanner The SWIG wrappers are compiled by default during normal installation The Python scripts which link to the wrappers and thereby illustrate their use include tools python main pyDrop in replacement for main APBS executable Only permits sequential runs tools python noinput pySimilar to main py but adds the ability to read input files and PQR files as Python strings and return energies and forces as Python lists This makes it a very useful tool for working with APBS via Python without dealing with a great deal of file I O
