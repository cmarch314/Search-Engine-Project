In this survey, we review\nrollback-recovery techniques that do not require special language\nconstructs, and classify them into two primary categories.\nCheckpoint-based rollback-recovery relies solely on checkpointed\nstates for system state restoration. Depending on when checkpoints\nare taken, existing approaches can be divided into uncoordinated\ncheckpointing, coordinated checkpointed and communication-induced\ncheckpointing. Log-based rollback-recovery uses checkpointing and\nmessage logging. There are three different log-based approaches,\nnamely, pessimistic logging, optimistic logging and causal logging.\nWe identify a set of desirable properties of rollback-recovery\nprotocols, and compare different approaches with respect to these\nproperties. Log-based rollback-recovery protocols generally rely on\nthe assumption of piecewise determinism and pay additional overhead\nto allow faster output commits and more localized recovery. We\npresent research issues under each approach, and review existing\nsolutions to address them. We also present implementation issues of\ncheckpointing and message logging. \n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 2395.0}
