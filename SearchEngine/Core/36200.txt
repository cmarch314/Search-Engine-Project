The difference is that if samples\n    really are paired, the variance in the denominator can be much smaller\n    (and hence power greater).  The paired t-test evaluates whether the mean\n    difference between paired samples is significantly different from\n    zero, whereas the non-paired t-test tests if the mean of group 1 is\n    different from the mean of group 2.  Let's do a &quot;classic&quot; example.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Below is the body weight of a group of people before and after some diet regime was applied:\n  </p>\n  <pre>\n    PERSON      BEFORE          AFTER      DIFFERENCE\n\n    Joe           200            180          -20\n    Sue           120            100          -20\n    George        175            155          -20</pre>\n  <p>\n    (Note: People here are like replicate experiments and Before and After are like Control versus Experimental).  \n    Doing a \n    &quot;paired t-test&quot; results in showing the diet is very effective -- everyone loses 20 lb with no \n    variance (that is: the \n    mean difference is significantly different from zero). On the other hand, if we take the \n    (Mean of the Afters) - (Mean of the Befores), the difference is still 20, however the variance \n    <i>within treatments</i> \n    is large so it is impossible \n    to say the difference is significant.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Basically when observations are &quot;paired&quot; the paired approach is the correct and \n    most powerful approach, when \n    observations are not paired then we have to use the unpaired approach.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n", "id": 36200.0}
