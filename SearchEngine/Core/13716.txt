This model offers a natural language\nfor encoding world knowledge in areas such as scheduling, \nvision, diagnosis, prediction and design, and it facilitates many \ncomputational tasks relevant to these domains.\n\nThe course will focus on techniques for constraint processing.\nIt will cover search techniques, consistency algorithms and\nstructure based techniques, and will focus on \nproperties that facilitate efficient solutions.\nExtensions will be given into applications such as \ntemporal reasoning, diagnosis, scheduling, \nand probabilistic Bayes networks.\nThe constraint language\nEclipse will be used for modelling and solving constraint problems.\nThe topics covered will be taken from the following list.\n    \n\n<p>\n<B> Outline: </B>\n\n\n<p><ul>\n<li>\nThe constraint network model, examples.
