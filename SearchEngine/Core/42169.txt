multi page FAQ grew too large and for release 116 it has been dispersed throughout the A HREF reference index html reference A The A HREF reference troubleshooting troubleshooting A page is perhaps the most important it contains most of the former bugs html which had outgrown its title The sections relating to library issues video OpenGL serial have moved to the web pages for those libraries Changes between releases has A HREF reference changes html its own page A as do the sections that cover specific A HREF environment platforms html platforms A and the how and why of A HREF environment export html exporting A your code p 828384 h5 id download a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 85 When can I download Processing and how much does it cost h5 86 87 p The software is free to download 88If you are interested in testing the BETA version of the software 89visit the a href http processing org download download a 9 page and follow the instructions p 9192 p We think it s important to have Processing freely available rather93than selling it for a million dollars under some godawful yearly94contract update scheme To that end we encourage people to spread95the word and refer them to the a href http processing org processing org a site p 9697 h5 id start a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 98 How do I get started h5 99 1 p Double click the Processing application and select something from1 1the examples menu File rarr Open rarr Examples Hit the run button1 2 which looks like the play button on a vcr or tape deck 1 3Lather rinse repeat as necessary p 1 4 1 5 p More information on using Processing itself is can be found in the 1 6 a href http processing org reference environment index html environment a 1 7section of the reference p 1 81 9 p If you re having trouble getting Processing to start check the11 a href reference troubleshooting index html nostart troubleshooting a 111section of the reference for possible solutions p 112113 h5 id learn a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 114 How do I learn to use Processing h5 115 116 p To learn the Processing language we recommend you try a few of the117built in examples and check out the a href reference a p 118119 p When using the examples or trying someone else s code 12 if you run across a function that you re not familiar with 121highlight the word right click ctrl click on the mac 122and select Find in Reference to open the reference page123for that keyword This can be helpful for understanding how124programs work p 125126 p If you re stuck or want to talk about your work head over to the A HREF http processing org discourse discourse A section of the site to find127open minds and helpful peers p 128129 p Once you ve graduated beyond the examples and devoured the A HREF reference index ext html complete A reference also check out the A HREF http processinghacks com Processing Hacks A site it s not quite reference not quite examples and not as developed as a library These mutants are known as hacks and there s lots of good stuff to be found p 13 131 h5 id platforms a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 132 On what platforms can I run Processing h5 133 134 p We release versions for Windows Mac OS X and Linux 135We test extensively on Mac and Windows platforms but not much on Linux p 136137 p More detailed information for the specific platforms can be found 138in the a href environment platforms html Platforms a section 139which also includes information about running the Processing14 Development Environment on a href environment platforms html other other141platforms a p 142143 h5 id opensource a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 144 Is Processing Open Source h5 145146 p The Processing development environment is released as open source147under the GPL The export libraries also known as core are148released under an LGPL license which means they can be used 149as a library and included in your project without you having to open up 15 your code though we encourage people to share anyway But if151you make changes to core you have to submit back to us 152More information about the GNU Public License can be found at a153href http www gnu org copyleft gpl html www gnu org copyleft gpl html a p 154155 p Processing also relies on other open projects namely p 156 157 ul 158 li the older a href http www savarese org oro ORO Matcher a 159distributed under a BSD style license as part of the 16 a href http jakarta

processing org developer site a and more178information about its use can be found over there p 17918 p The source code for the libraries is also included with the Processing181software itself should you want to modify them for your own use If you182want to modify the library for your own use you can include the java file 183as part of your sketch Just be sure to remove the package processing xx 184line at the beginning The Processing environment does not allow packages 185186 p We need help Having shared all the code and made it available for187free doesn t it just make you want to pitch in We have too much work188to do and can t keep up with things We love to see bug fixes new189libraries etc If you re interested contact us via the a19 href http processing org discourse discourse a section of the191site p 192193 h5 id attribution a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 194 Do I have to cite Processing Do I have to share my code 195Can I distribute my sketches h5 196197 p We like it when people include a Built with Processing note with a198link back to the site since it helps create interest and brings in199more people to the project We don t can t shouldn t require it but2 it makes us happy because the project is free and this is one way you2 1can help give back to us p 2 22 3 p You can also remove the source code from web pages that you export 2 4but in the spirit of the Processing project overall we include it by2 5default so as to encourage sharing and learning from one another p 2 62 7 p You can distribute your sketches all you want and commercial projects should 2 8be just fine too however we place no warranty on the software see the 2 9download page for the license shenanigans p 21 211 h5 id versions a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 212 What s with the version numbers h5 213 214 p This is not 1 software It s buggy and may kill people That s part215of why we used to make everyone sign up to download so that we know that you 216care enough to bother and have more of an inkling of what you re 217getting into p 218219 p At least until the final 1 version we ll be using four digit22 numbers for the release Revision 85 was the first beta release 221which means that all the features are in but not all the bugs222are out There remain several known issues with the beta release 223that will need to be sorted out before we re comfortable calling 224a release an actual final 1 p 225226 p The numbered releases aren t always heavily tested so don t be surprised 227if when something breaks Check the a href http processing org bugs bugs a 228section of the site and report the problem if it s new and in the meantime 229you can go back to the previous numbered release until there s a fix p 23 231 p EM please note that Processing is not yet known to be responsible 232for any actual deaths EM p 233234 h5 id naming a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 235 Why is it called ldquo Processing rdquo h5 236 237 p At their core computers are processing machines They modify move and 238combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations 239Our software allows people to control these actions and representations 24 through writing their own programs The project also focuses on241the ldquo process rdquo of creation rather than end results The design of the software supports 242and encourages sketching and the website presents fragments of projects 243and exposes the concepts behind finished software p 244245 p ldquo Proce55ing rdquo is the spelling we originally used for the URL 246of the web site because Processing was already taken Even 247though it s a combination of numbers and letters it was always248pronounced ldquo processing rdquo Since then 249we saved our pennies had a can drive and used the funds to 25 acquire the processing org domain name 251As a result we are no longer using the name ldquo Proce55ing rdquo p 252253 p When we see it with the 55 s it annoys us and we want to 254punch people in the face Or punch ourselves in the face for using it 255in the first place Actually we try not to be that emotional about it256but we re trying to avoid the previous naming However to257make it more confusing we sometimes still use ldquo p5 rdquo 258 but not p55 as a shortened version of the name p 25926 h5 id sketchbook a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 261 What is the sketchbook What do you mean by sketches h5 262 263 p We think most ldquo integrated development environments rdquo 264 Microsoft Visual Studio Codewarrior Eclipse etc tend to be265overkill for the type of audience we re targeting with Processing For266this reason we ve introduced the sketchbook which is a more lightweight 267way to organize projects As trained designers we d like the process 268of coding to be a lot more like sketching The sketchbook setup and269the idea of just sitting down and writing code without having27 to write two pages to set up a graphics context thread etc is271a small step towards that goal p 272273 p The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily274 via a little run button is a direct descendant of John Maeda s work275in a href http dbn media mit edu Design By Numbers a and 276our experiences maintaining it Yes other languages and environments 277have done this first but in our case the concept is drawn from DBN p 278279 h5 id whyjava a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 28 Why Java Or why such a Java esque programming language h5 281 282 p We didn t set out to make the ultimate language for visual283programming we set out to make something that was p 284285 ol 286 li a sketchbook for our own work simplifying the majority 287 of tasks that we undertake li 288 li a teaching environment for that kind of process and li 289 li a point of transition to more complicated or difficult 29 languages like full blown Java or C a gateway drug to 291 more geekier and more difficult things li 292 ol 293294 p At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and295simplicity of use i e if we didn t care about speed Python Ruby296or many other scripting languages would make far more sense297 especially for the simplicity and education aspect of it 298If we didn t care about transition to more advanced languages 299we d get rid of the crummy C style well algol really syntax 3 etc etc p 3 13 2 p Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it s3 3far more forgiving than C and also allows users to export sketches for3 4distribution via the web p 3 53 6 p Processing is not intended as the ultimate environment language in3 7fact the language is just Java but with a new graphics and 3 8utility API along with some simplifications Fundamentally 3 9Processing just assembles our experience in building things 31 and trying to simplifies the parts that we felt should be easier p 311312 h5 id flash a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 313 Dude Where s the Timeline This Sucks hellip Awesome A Flash Killer h5 314315 p We re not targeting the same audience Flash 316If we wanted to make a Flash killer we d317have set out to do that and our stated purpose would have been more318specific and we d have more on the site about Processing vs Flash 319in the competitive shootout sense right now we just have32 information about how the syntax differs so that people can make the321transition p 322323 p We could have saved a lot of time if we just wanted to build a better324Flash And in the end as two people do you really think we can or325should bother competing with a company as large as Macromedia 326Macrodobe Does anyone really want a better Flash p 327328 p There are things that are always going to be better in Flash 329and other types of work that will always be better in Processing But33 fundamentally and this cannot be emphasized enough there is no331all or nothing game hellip We re talking about tools Do people refuse332to use pencils because pens exist No you just use them for different333things and for specific reasons If Processing works for you then334use it If not don t It s easy It s free You re not being forced335to do anything p 336337 p As we have heard Flash 8 will be better at doing some of the pixel338editing image stuff you can do in Processing but there are still lots339of things we re covering that s not focused on moving pixels OpenGL34 acceleration easy serial port access video input and other things341that are incomplete in beta but just around the corner Export to342Application and more p 343344345 h5 id java a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 346I know Java is this Java How do I use it that way 347 h5 348349 p Processing code is converted to straight Java code using the preprocessor when you hit the Run button This also makes it possible to embed other Java code in your sketches or use the core jar file from the Processing distribution to develop your own sketches with other environments For instance if you want to use A HREF http eclipse org Eclipse A there are instructions on the A HREF http processing org discourse discourse A section of the site 35 p 351352 p The main rule when using Java code You cannot use anything from the AWT or Swing which is built on the AWT because it will interfere with our graphics model If you want to add scroll bars and buttons to your projects you should make them using Processing code or embed your Processing applet inside another Swing or AWT application see below Even if they appear to work such sketches are likely to break when you try to run on other operating systems or other versions of Java p 353354 p Another point to note when using Java code is that we only support Java 1 4 and earlier You cannot currently use 1 5 syntax in the Processing Development Environment If you want to use Java 1 5 or later take core jar and develop your project with another Java IDE again see below More about Java 1 5 and the rationale for why we don t like it much can be found A HREF here A 355356 p Since we can t really support anything and everything that you might want to do when interfacing with Java or using core jar inside a Java environment we have a separate A HREF http processing org discourse yabb beta YaBB cgi board Integrate discussion area A on the discourse board for asking questions about it This is mostly a peer supported area p 357358 p If you want to embed Processing into another Java application visit the developer s reference for A HREF http dev processing org reference core javadoc processing core PApplet html PApplet A A discussion of how to use Processing with Eclipse is found A HREF http processing org discourse yabb beta YaBB cgi board Integrate action display num 1117133941 here A p 35936 p Also note that when using Processing outside the development environment the headaches of the Java CLASSPATH and PATH return and using libraries gets much nastier These issues are just one of the nasty things that we try to hide in the Processing environment things that separate Processing from straight Java coding We feel that it is important to put the good stuff at the surface and that those nastier details don t teach students much anyway they annoy advanced users too p 361362363 h5 id dbn a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 364Where does this project come from Is this DBN 365 h5 366 p Processing is a descendant of the A HREF http dbn media mit edu Design By Numbers A DBN project DBN is a simplified programming language that was developed to teach the structure and interpretation of software in a visual manner Design By Numbers was created by John Maeda and accompanied a book of the same name While at the A HREF http acg media mit edu ACG A Ben and Casey were involved in the development and maintenance of the DBN softare and courseware and that experience provided the basis for the Processing project p 367 p While working on DBN Ben developed several experimental versions that included other programming languages Python and Scheme and drawing features color changing the window size magnification movie recording and even OpenGL support but it was clear that these neither made sense for the project but also polluted Maeda s concept of a simplified programming language and environment p 368 p At the time around 1999 2 work at the ACG was usually developed via sketches developed in Java and later moved to applications written in C using OpenGL We were curious about how to meld the idea of sketching in code with the pedagogical aspect of DBN Development of Processing began formally in the Spring of 2 1 with discussions between Casey and Ben about API and feature set and the first version of Processing would be used in August 2 1 for a A HREF http dbn media mit edu workshops musabi workshop A at Musashino Art University in Japan p 36937 371 h5 id update a href top img src img up arrow gif width 26 height 19 alt Top a 372 Why Is Processing Connecting to the Network h5 373 374 p After you double click Processing it will check the site for375updates This is helpful so that we can keep people376aware of the frequent updates to Processing p 377378 p In so doing it also sends a random number that identifies yours as a379unique machine but sends no personal information to us 38 This really helps us get a general idea of how many people are using the381software which is really important for things like382writing grants so that we can keep Processing free p 383384 p If the network connection causes you trouble it can be shut off385inside the
