Casale, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>\n\n<p>In recent weeks, researchers from several distinct departments\nin the University of California, Irvine, have been applying various\ncomputational methods to determine an optimal research protocol for\nHuntington's disease. The departments include computer science,\nchemistry and the college of medicine plus others that have played\nadvisory and consulting roles. An overview of this work will be\ngiven, and the talk will then concentrate on two aspects of the\nresearch: (1) development of a computational model of huntingtin\n(the HD protein) aggregation, and (2) an \"on-line\" algorithm for\nfinding commercially available compounds as experimental controls\nand potential therapeutic agents. Time permitting, a novel and\nspeculative approach to the geometric sampling problem (which may,\nor may not, be relevant to the title topic) will be presented.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3718.0}
