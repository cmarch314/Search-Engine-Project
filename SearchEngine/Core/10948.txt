Rourke From orourke whatever cs jhu edu Newsgroups sci math Subject Radical difference summary of responses Date 28 Dec 9 15 8 34 GMT Reply To orourke cs jhu edu Organization Smith College Thanks to all who responded to the problem I posted The problem is Find a lower bound on r n k the minimum positive value of sum i 1 k sqrt a i sum i 1 k sqrt b i where a i and b i are integers no larger than n Andrew Odlyzko and Michael Ben Or both informed me that this is a known difficult problem Its decade old origins are not clear to me but at the least Ron Graham has discussed it in public lectures The consensus seems to be that the only bounds known are something like n 2 k or perhaps n k 2 k or perhaps 4 n k 4 k but in any case n p with p exponential in k On the other hand Odlyzko feels that the true bound is more like n k or perhaps n 2 k n p with p linear in k The gap between what can be proved and what seems to be true is rather wide but closing it seems difficult Joseph O Rourke Smith College From eppstein ics uci edu To jmchen pub jiangmen gd cn Subject Re Welcome to my site on Equal sums of like powers Date Mon 28 Jul 1997 15 1 21 7 Thanks for the pointer to your page on equal sums of like powers http www jiangmen gd cn person chen chenhome htm You know by the way of the following application of such sums It is an important open problem in computational geometry how much precision is needed to compute lengths of polygonal paths in order to determine which of two paths is longer If the path vertices have integer coordinates each length is a sum of square roots of integers so the problem can be expressed in number theoretic terms how small can be a nonzero number that is the sum of k terms sqrt a i where each a i is an integer smaller than some bound N The known lower bounds are something like N 2 k but the best known upper bound i e explicit construction is much larger something like N k This upper bound is based on sums like the ones you treat I think this may be due to Ron Graham but unfortunately I can t find the reference offhand Marshall Bern showed it to me and Graham may have showed it to him Here s how it works Suppose we have two sets of numbers a i and b i such that sum a i j b i j for all j from to k You have a page http www jiangmen gd cn person chen TarryPrb htm on this case For instance your home page has a i 1 19 2 51 57 8 82 b i 2 12 31 4 69 71 85 k 6 Then consider the number x sum sqrt N a i sqrt N b i Each of the summands sqrt N a i can be expressed as a Taylor series sqrt N 1 y 2 y 2 8 y 3 16 5y 4 128 7y 5 256 where y a i N The fact that all the sums of powers of ai and bi are equal means that the initial terms in these Taylor series cancel and x O sqrt n y k 1 O N k 1 2 Numerically with the a i above and N 1 we have x 2 5 1 11 With N 1 we have x 6 1 18 and in general multiplying N by 1 is going to lead to a reduction by around 3 1 6 in x With more of the sums of powers being equal x would go down even more quickly as a function of N So solutions to the Prouhet Tarry Escott problem lead to quite small sums of square roots David Eppstein UC Irvine Dept of Information Computer Science eppstein ics uci edu

If the path vertices have\ninteger coordinates, each length is a sum of square roots of integers,\nso the problem can be expressed in number-theoretic terms: how small can\nbe a nonzero number that is the sum of k terms +-sqrt(a_i) where each\na_i is an integer smaller than some bound N.\n\nThe known lower bounds are something like N^{-2^k}, but the best known\nupper bound (i.e. explicit construction) is much larger, something like\nN^{-k}.

Here's how it works:\n\nSuppose we have two sets of numbers a_i and b_i,\nsuch that sum(a_i^j - b_i^j)=0 for all j from 0 to k.\n(You have a page <A HREF=\"http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/TarryPrb.htm\">http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/TarryPrb.htm</A>\non this case.)  For instance, your home page has\na_i={1,19,20,51,57,80,82}, b_i={2,12,31,40,69,71,85}, k=6.\n\nThen, consider the number\n\tx = sum(sqrt(N - a_i) - sqrt(N - b_i)).\n\nEach of the summands sqrt(N - a_i) can be expressed as a Taylor series\nsqrt(N)*(1-y^2-y^2/8-y^3/16-5y^4/128-7y^5/256-...)\nwhere y=a_i/N.  The fact that all the sums of powers of ai and bi\nare equal means that the initial terms in these Taylor series cancel\nand x = O(sqrt(n) y^{k+1}) = O(N^{-k-1/2}).\n\nNumerically, with the a_i above and N=1000, we have x ~= 2.5 * 10^{-11}.\nWith N=10000 we have x ~= 6 * 10^{-18}, and in general multiplying N by\n10 is going to lead to a reduction by around 3*10^6 in x.  With more of\nthe sums of powers being equal, x would go down even more quickly as a\nfunction of N.
