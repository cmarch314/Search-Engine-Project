{"text": "International Workshop on Innovative Architecture for Future Generation High Performance Processors and Systems Date March 16 17 2 9 Video conference center 2F Maui Research Technology Center Kihei Maui Hawaii Program Committee Prof Atsushi Kubota Hiroshima City U Japan Prof Hironori Nakajo TUAT Japan Prof Peter Kogge Notre Dame Prof Kiyofumi Tanaka JAIST Japan Prof Hans Zima JPL Nikil Dutt UCI Jose L Ayala UCM Spain Organizing Committee Organizer Prof Kazuki Joe Finance Chairs Profs Nicolau and Joe Publication Chair Prof Veidenbaum Description This invited workshop aims to bring together researchers and designers from academia and industry to discuss directions in the development of high performance parallel distributed and multimedia processors and systems The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler operating system and application experts The main goal of the workshop is to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and software systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects about software systems and by software writers about architecture The increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased interaction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately assess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems The main themes of the workshop are software and technology driven and constrained new architectures compiler architecture interaction and co design and application requirements and characteristics Both numerical and non numerical applications such as database data mining Web and Java based and high performance embedded applications are of interest In all cases a longer term view and assessment of the future is of most interest This year s special focus is on multi core systems and ways to explore single program parallelism on such systems All aspects of design compilation and application design are of interest for both single chip multi core processors and multi processor systems built from such chips and are the 2 9 special topics Other topics of interest include but are not limited to the following All aspects of processor design Multi threaded processors Large scale multiprocessors Memory technology and memory hierarchy organization Applications and their performance Power management Embedded system design The workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations with discussion Presentations will be limited to 2 min to provide sufficient time for discussion An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future directions in addition to recently obtained results Speculation is encouraged Submission and Publication The invitees wishing to make a presentation should submit an extended abstract up to 3 pages by 2 28 9 Submissions should be electronic in pdf format The abstracts will be reviewed and printed in the on site proceedigns The final proceedings consisting of full papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting The papers will undergo an additional review process and will be selected for publication in the post proceedings Papers will be due by July 1st 2 9 Publication instructions will be distributed by CS Press at a later date Participants Hans Zima Peter Kogge Nikil Dutt Jose L Ayala Hironori Nakajo Atsushi Kubota Jun Yao Yasuhiko
