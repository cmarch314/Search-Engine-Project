Taylor, David L. Levine, Kari A. Nies,\nand Debra Brodbeck in\nTechnical Report TR-128-P, Software Engineering Research Center,\n1398 Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN\n47907-1398, November 1994.\n(To appear in <i>ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</i>)\n\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nCATS (Concurrency Analysis Tool Suite) is designed to satisfy several \ncriteria: it must analyze implementation-level Ada source code and check \nuser-specified conditions associated with program source code; it must be \nmodularized in a fashion that supports flexible composition with other \ntool components, including integration with a variety of testing and \nanalysis techniques; and its performance and capacity must be sufficient \nfor analysis of real application programs.  Meeting these objectives \ntogether is significantly more difficult than meeting any of them alone.\nWe describe the design and rationale of CATS and report experience with \nan implementation. The issues addressed here are primarily practical \nconcerns for modularizing and integrating tools for analysis of actual \nsource programs. We also report successfully applying CATS to major\nsubsystems of a (non-toy) highly concurrent user interface system (Chiron). \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 27 13:36:13 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 26105.0}
