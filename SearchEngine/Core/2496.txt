The latter has a couple of entertaining theoretical and\ncomputational properties, stemming from the fact that it is nothing\nbut the bivariate halfspace depth interpreted in the Poincar\\'e plane\nmodel of the Lobachevski geometry - in particular, invariance with\nrespect to the M\\\"obius group and favorable time complexities of\nalgorithms. The practical implications involve a new fancy\nlocation-scale typical value, the Student median, as well as somewhat\nextravagant graphical tool for exploring distributional properties of\nunivariate samples, a sort of cousin to the quantile-quantile plot.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, perhaps more than those particular accomplishments it may be\nworthy to note potential new views on data and questions that the\nprocess raises: the role of invariance (if any) in data analyses;\nwhether there can be such a thing as median in sophisticated\nsituations; whether classical rank-based nonparametrics can be\nelevated beyond their traditional (essentially) univariate setting;\nand last but not least, whether all these hallucinations can be\neffectively computed. \n\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2496.0}
