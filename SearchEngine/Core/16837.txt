The world-wide efforts to construct databases of protein and small molecule structures, DNA sequences, metabolic pathways, regulatory mechanisms, pharmaceutical structures and activities, patient response data, etc., have created many opportunities for intelligent systems. Central questions include: What function is encoded in a protein sequence? What structure will it fold into? How can we make better pharmaceutical drugs? What factors effect patient response to treatment? Partial solutions to these problems have been found using extensions of research on knowledge representation, search, and learning. \n<p>\nICS faculty are involved in a project to develop a knowledge-based systems for recommending a customized multiple-drug therapy for HIV infected patients. We are also exploring an approach to creating knowledge-based systems by learning from patient data and have identified guidelines for screening for forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. We have developed knowledge-based approaches to protein structure prediction, and implemented novel sequence-structure search algorithms \nand recognition methods. We are modeling DNA mutation and repair in connection with cancer-related studies. \n<p>\nThe biomedical domain is a rich source of application problems on which to test AI methods, and we welcome inquiries from academic and industrial colleagues with interesting biomedical research problems amenable to an AI-based computational approach.
