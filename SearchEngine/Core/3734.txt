Propagation delays \nare specified as a time bound (upper & lower bound) due to \nmanufacturing and environmental changes. \n        Three types of constraints are required in modelling \nthe properties of a circuit viz. max (AND gate), min (OR gate) \nand linear (imposed constraints).  Computing the maximum separations \nunder these constraints is discussed in the talk. \n\n<p>\n         We restrict ourselves to ACYCLIC constraint graphs.\nIt is known that the problem can be solved in polynomail time\nin  the presence of only a single type of constraint. The problem\nis NP-Complete when both max and min type constraints are present.\nThe complexity of the problem with max and linear constraint \nis yet unknown (min + linear is dual of max - linear).  It is conjectured \nthat it can be solved in polynomial time. We have studied the best known \nalgorithm( by Yen) which is conjectured to run in polynomial time.\nWe are working on some approaches to have a tight bound on the \nalgorithm and to verify the posed conjecture for max-linear constraint \nproblem.\n\n\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3734.0}
