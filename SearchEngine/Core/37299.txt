Introduction</h2></center>\nThis document presents the foundations of the Daylight Chemical Information\nSystem, including our motivations and goals, theoretical discussions on\nchemical information processing and chemical database design, and insight into\nthe inner workings of some of our algorithms.\n<br><br>\nAt Daylight, our goal is to provide the best known computer algorithms for\nchemical information processing to those who need them.  We provide these\nalgorithms both as a Daylight Toolkit  programmer's library and\nas a set of ready-to-use programs for the non-programmer.  This document is meant to\nserve both groups as well as users of other products that \nincorporate Daylight's technology.<p>\nThis document does not provide specifics on how to use Daylight applications and \ntoolkits (see User Manual's, Programmer's Guide, and the man pages for this\ninformation).  Rather, it is designed to help you understand how the software\nworks.  In general each chapter is written with the assumption that the reader\nhas read the previous chapters.\n\n<br><br>\n<i>Go To Next Chapter...</i>\n<a href=\"theory.mol.html\">2.
