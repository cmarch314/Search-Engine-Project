But the general schema for\ninformation about web resources is:\n\n        link(A1, A2, rel)\n                ==&gt; \"There is a link of type _rel_ from A1 to A2\"\n\n        attribute(A1, name, val)\n                ==&gt; \"The _name_ attribute of A1 is _val_\"\n\nDan\n\n\nIn message &lt;add10d040a0210045498@[128.195.21.209]&gt;, Jim Whitehead writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;One aspect of the versioning of WWW content which appears in all\n&gt;work/proposals to date is a versioned HTTP GET method.  A versioned GET\n&gt;supports browsing of an arbitrary version of an entity, a basic\n&gt;requirement.  Examples of this include (references are to work which is\n&gt;available from the working group home page, at URL:\n&gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/</a>&gt;)\n&gt;\n&gt;Pettengill &amp; Arango:\n&gt;  - add a \",{version_identifier}\" suffix to the end of a URL to specify the\n&gt;version identifier\n&gt;\n&gt;MKS:\n&gt;  - add a \";version={version_identifier}\" suffix to the end of a URL\n&gt;\n&gt;Whitehead:\n&gt;  - add a \";v={version_identifier}\" suffix to the end of a URL\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From these examples, you can see that there is a basic similarity to all\n&gt;approaches.\n&gt;\n&gt;I would like to suggest we adopt the MKS approach for specifying version\n&gt;identifiers in a versioned GET operation as a usage convention for our\n&gt;future work.  I like the MKS approach because it uses a semicolon (;) to\n&gt;separate the version specification from the rest of the path (this is\n&gt;superior to a (,) because a comma is not a reserved character according to\n&gt;the URL specification in RFC 1738 \"Uniform Resource Locators\", and hence\n&gt;might legally be part of a path), and because the use of a full \"version\"\n&gt;tag is more readable, and is less likely to have a name collision with\n&gt;another URL usage convention than the \"v\" tag.\n&gt;\n&gt;Note that this convention only specifies the version of the entity, and\n&gt;does not specify the version of each directory in the heirarchy leading to\n&gt;that entity.\n&gt;\n&gt;Comments?\n&gt;\n&gt;- Jim Whitehead &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ejw@ics.uci.edu\">ejw@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0005.html\">Kenji Takahashi: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0003.html\">Andre van der Hoek: \"Re: Version identifier in URL.\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0002.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0005.html\">Kenji Takahashi: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "id": 34520.0}
