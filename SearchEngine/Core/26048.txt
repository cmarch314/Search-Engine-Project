{"text": "Intelligence Alan Turing the father of computer science proposed a test to determine if an artificial system could be intelligent He proposed to play a game where a human interrogator would ask questions to either another human or to a machine which would be hidden out of sight behind a brick wall or on the other side of the earth If the human interrogator would be fooled 3 of the time the system would pass the test and ought to be called intelligent Now this is a somewhat arbitrary line in the sand Why 3 How many humans must it fool Moreover why would we be so concerned about human intelligence Can t we imagine other types of intelligence that would not be able to fool us I don t think we should take the claim too seriously that this ought to be the working definition of intelligence but rather a very useful illustration of what may be needed to build robots that are behaving in ways similar to humans Turing believed that by the year 2 this machine would be reality It didn t turn out that way The Turing test did spark a lot of heated debate about whether we could ever build machines that can think in the same way as humans do Most importantly can we ever build robots that have a conscious mind John Searle was the most vocal opponent of this idea He invented interesting thought experiments which according to his reasoning would make it clear that such a thing could not happen He imagined a Chinese Room with a human in it that would receive questions in Chinese S He would also have access to an enormous library with a Chinese answer to every conceivable Chinese question Mechanically the person would look up the answer perhaps randomly picking from a large set of possible answers and return it to the interrogator Clearly this person has no idea of Chinese even though s he would pass this variant of the Turing test One objection could be that it is really somewhat unrealistic to ask for a library with answers to every possible question it would require more atoms to store than the universe has to offer So perhaps we should restrict ourselves to systems that are limited in their capabilities of storing data This seems like a workable sophistication of the Turing test but I am pretty sure someone else will come with a system that may beat the Turing test in another way which would then require addition changes because surely that system could not be really intelligent In another famous thought experiment the brain prosthesis experiment by Clark Glymour one imagines replacing the neurons in one s brain one by one with electrical circuits Each circuit models the input output function of a neuron perfectly By the time we are done we have replaced the entire brain by a computer We can do it again in reverse order to rebuild the human Assuming for a moment this can be technically achieved would we then have altered the human mind in any way Many people among whom Searle believe this is the case During the process they believe that one will gradually loose any conscious experience of the world yet one s behavior will remain unaltered How about this thought experiment then In 3 AC a smart scientist comes up with a really clever way to build an intelligent machine S He first assembles a long strand of amino acids which s he places in a small protein cover The strand of amino acids will copy itself and code for new proteins to be assembled The proteins become a robotic body made mostly of carbohydrates and water with a brain S He then decides to raise this robot among her biological children This robot has a normal life because it looks so much like a real human being And some day it starts referring to itself as me It looks in the mirror and understands who that person is When published people cry out this is not a real robot it was just a copy of a human being grown in a test tube So the scientist develops new techniques to copy the exact same process by now with new synthetic molecules that have the same properties as carbon hydrogen iron etc People are still not satisfied until the same procedure is now repeated with electronic circuits Now what Intelligent machine or not For me these examples drive home the fact that a mind has nothing to do with the substrate it is made from It s about computation and information And therefore if our goal is creating human intelligence yes we will be able to build intelligent machines that may have conscious minds real emotions and all the other good and bad things that make us human These are not magical but rather functional properties We evolved them for a purpose They are fascinating and utterly un understood today but perhaps not un understandable or non replicable Our brain is extremely complex propelled by principles that we don t understand today It therefore seems far to premature to claim that a consciousness mind is something reserved uniquely for human beings Max Welling UCI 2 8 ", "_id":
