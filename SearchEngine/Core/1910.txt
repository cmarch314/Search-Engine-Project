doctoral symposium presentation at ICMR 2 13 7 3 12 Setup personal website and Blog 7 19 12 Got a Google Ph D Fellowship 5 25 12 Completed Topic Proposal for Ph D Projects CueNet This project arose from a need to associate context with photos to tell stories Stories without context are meaningless And data without context is gibberish In order to combat this lack of context we started working on CueNet a framework which would discover event context for personal photos We invented a technique called progressive discovery which would navigate from source to source to find the most relevant event and person information about a given photo Tolkien We developed a computational model of transitions to generate a basic linear story skeleton which consists of a set of media items The user of the system is then allowed to add textual descriptions to this story to provide its readers with appropriate context to interpret the story Finally the resulting story is displayed in a familiar comic like layout and shared with the intended readers You can find other stories here here here and here Emme Emme is a research project under the supervision of Prof Ramesh Jain It involved in creating an event based media organizing and visualization tool Click on the picture below to look at the prototype on YouTube Wicker Wicker is an interesting class project which sits with the Firefox browser as a plugin and displays articles from Wikipedia which are similar in content to the webpage you are currently browsing We used Hadoop to generate our text index which would in turn be used to compare
