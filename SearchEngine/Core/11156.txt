special issue for 31st FOCS In this paper we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input As a result we can guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded away from zero using a number of triangles within a constant of optimal this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh element quality and mesh complexity of this form and therefore the first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input geometries and the quality of its output In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets so that all angles are non obtuse using linearly many triangles and to triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and a number of simplices within a constant of optimal Also we can augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation has linear complexity In later follow up work I showed that the same technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have total length within a constant factor of optimal Bern Mitchell and Ruppert showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon without obtuse angles see Faster circle packing with application to nonobtuse triangulation for an algorithmic improvement to their technique Additionally with Bern

Bannister W E Devanny and D Eppstein arXiv 131 377 Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics ANALCO14 Portland Oregon 2 14 pp 92 1 3 We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of classes of acyclic graphs by finding forbidden patterns in the permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden In particular dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width 2 partial orders have universal point sets of size O n3 2 derived from superpatterns of the same size for the 321 avoiding

272 283 Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths and an assignment of the angles 18 and 36 to the angles between adjacent edges we show how to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of the graph as a flat folding on a line As a consequence we can determine whether two dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be flattened The main idea behind the result is to
