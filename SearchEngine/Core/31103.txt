At the Space and \nMissile Systems Center (SMC), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), \nand Air Force Material Command (AFMC), two methods for evaluating \ncontractor capability are in use. The first method is based on the \nSoftware Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) \nfor software and uses the Software Capability Evaluation (SCE) process. \nThe second method is the Software Development Capability Evaluation (SDCE), \nwhich includes its own model and process. Conducting either of these \nevaluations during the source selection process increases the likelihood \nof selecting a contractor capable of developing the required software \nwithin program constraints. Additionally, the SCE and SDCE help identify \nand manage risks early in a program's lifecycle and provide a means to \nobtain contractual commitment to the use of sound software engineering \npractices throughout the lifecycle.\n\n<p>\n\nThe purpose of our presentation is to introduce the SDCE and compare it \nwith the SCE. We will begin with an historical background of the SDCE and \na brief description of its model and process, including revisions to the \nmodel that were developed at The Aerospace Corporation. We will then compare \nthe SDCE and SCE in terms of their purposes, models, and processes, review \napplications of the SDCE and SCE to various DoD programs, and discuss the \nbenefits of their use. Finally, we will examine lessons learned from past \nevaluation experiences.\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Biographies:</b>\n\nMrs. Rita C. Creel is Manager of the Acquisition Support Section in the \nSoftware Engineering Subdivision at The Aerospace Corporation, where she \nsupports acquisition and analysis activities for large, software-intensive \nsystems. Prior to joining Aerospace, Mrs. Creel worked in the Space and \nTechnology Group at TRW, Inc., where she participated in and led full \nlifecycle software system development activities for communications and \nscientific satellite systems. She received her Bachelor of Science degree \nin Engineering and Computer Science from California State University, \nLong Beach.\n\n<p>\n\nMrs. Bonnie R. Troup is an Engineering Specialist with The Aerospace \nCorporation. Mrs. Troup has more than 12 years of experience in software \nengineering and software acquisition management; she is currently the \ncorporate focal point for the SDCE. During her previous employment at \nTRW, Mrs. Troup was Project Engineer and software engineering lead, where \nshe participated in an SCE. Her work at Aerospace includes software \nsystems engineering consulting services for the Evolved Expendable Launch \nVehicle (EELV) program, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), \nand the Milstar program, and coordinating SDCE efforts for several program \noffices. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics \nfrom UC Riverside, and her Master of Science degree in Computer Science \nfrom Loyola Marymount University.\n\n<P>\n\n<B>Coordinator: </B>Sergio Alvarado, \n<A HREF=\"http://www.aero.org\">The Aerospace Corporation</A>, \n<A HREF=\"mailto:alvarado@aero.org\">alvarado@aero.org</a>\n\n<p>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html\">\nUCI Maps and Directions</A> to meeting are available.\n\n<P>\n\n<strong>Next Meeting:</strong>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>Date: Friday, February 19, 1999 (a week earlier than usual)\n<BR>Topic: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/flyers/99/feb99.html\">\nPractical Software Measurement --</a><br>\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/flyers/99/feb99.html\">\nA Guide to Objective Program Insight</a><br>\nSpeaker: Leia White, Software Productivity Consortium<br>\nCoordinator: Leitha Purcell, Northrop Grumman Corporation\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nThe Irvine Research Unit in Software wishes to thank its \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsors.html\">corporate sponsors</A>:\n\n<P>\n\n<strong>Sustaining:</strong>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nThe Boeing Company * Boeing North American, Inc. * Microsoft Corporation<br>\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation * Raytheon Company * Sun Microsystems Laboratories * TRW\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<strong>Supporting:</strong>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n Supporting:\n     Beckman Coulter * FileNet Corporation * Printronix, Inc.*<p>\n    Continuus Software Corporation * Hewlett Packard\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nFor further information on <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin.html\">SPIN</A>\nor <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">IRUS,</A>\n<DD>\ncontact <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/staff.html\">Debra Brodbeck</A>\nat (949) 824-2260, <A HREF=\"mailto:brodbeck@ics.uci.edu\">brodbeck@ics.uci.edu</A></DD>\n\n<BR>&nbsp;\n<BR>&nbsp;\n<BR>&nbsp;\n\n<P>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">Irvine Research Unit in Software</A></ADDRESS>\n\n<BR><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">Information and Computer Science</A>\n<BR>University of California, Irvine CA 92697-3425\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 31103.0}
