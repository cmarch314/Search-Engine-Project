At the top of the off-ramp, take a left onto Bison. Follow\nBison onto the campus, and take the second right onto East Peltason. The\nentrance to lot 12B the first left turn after Bison, just after you\ncrest the hill (there's a left-turn lane, but no light or stop sign.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf you're coming from the south on the 73, get off at the Bison exit,\nand take a right onto Bison and onto the campus, then follow the\ndirections above.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf you're coming from the south on the 405, then get off at\nCulver. Turn left onto Culver and follow it until you reach\nCampus (after University and Harvard). Take a right onto Campus, and,\nat the second (I think) light, a left onto East Peltason. Follow East\nPeltason around to the south side of the campus; the entrance to lot\n12B will be on your right after a stop sign at Los Trancos.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn your right as you enter lot 12B, there are around ten \"pay and\ndisplay\" spots for which you can purchase a ticket at the blue\nmachine. The majority of lot 12B is a permit-only lot, though,\nso you'll proabbly need to get a\nparking permit. You can pick one up from the any of the parking\nstructures. If I've arranged a permit for you, then you should just be\nable to give your name and they'll give you one. The closest parking\nstructure is the \"Engineering Parking Structure\" on East\nPeltason between Gabrielino and Anteater (marked ICS/ENG on the campus\nmap, E7). The map shows the entrance at Gabrielino, although I think\nit's actually at Anteater. So, if you're coming from Bison, you pass\nlot 12B, pick up your permit from the structure, and then double back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBe sure to get a \"reserved\" parking permit, which will allow\nyou to park in spaces marked \"AR\"; lot 12B requires AR permits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPark in lot 12B, and walk towards the bottom right corner (reckoning\nfrom the entrance.) Turn right to walk along the footpath (the \"ring\nmall\").\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe corner of the parking lot you're looking for looks like this:\n</p>\n\n<img src=../images/directions1-lot.jpg>\n\n<p>\nAnd then the route to follow looks like this:\n</p>\n\n<img src=../images/directions2-mall.jpg>\n\n\n<p>\nThat's Bren Hall that you can see through the trees; as you approach,\nthe shade on the sixth-floor patio is pretty distinctive.\nIt's the first large building directly on the path you're following:\n</p>\n\n<img src=../images/directions3-brenhall.jpg>\n\n<p>\nThe part of the building you\ncan see here is one of two arms that form an \"L\" shape, pointing away\nfrom you as you come from this direction. The entrance to the building\nis at the inside of the L. As you come past the first wing of the\nbuilding, you should turn right. You'll see a glass-covered stairway,\nlike this:\n</p>\n\n<img src=../images/directions4-entrance.jpg>\n\n<p>\nThe entrance to the building is a door at the base of this\nstairway. Go through the doorway and into the lobby on the right. Turn\nleft to find the elevators (they will be on the left again) and take\none to the fifth floor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTurn right on exiting the elevator (it's the only way to go) and then\nimmediate left down the corridor. Take the next left and follow the\ncorridor;\nmy office is 5086, which will be on your right, a couple of doors\nafter the corridor makes another left turn.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 4903.0}
