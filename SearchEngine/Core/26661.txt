Architect Netscape Communications Corporation kswenson netscape com http people netscape com kswenson The web has revolutionized the way that we do many things Workflow is no exception A few years ago we saw the emergence of HTTP interfaces on top of existing workflow products Now we are beginning to see the emergence of workflow which has been designed from the beginning based around internet standards In the same way that a hypertext document can have pieces served from any number of servers one flavor of new workflow systems is to be fully distributed such that different parts of the workflow come from any number of different servers Standardization of directory services through LDAP is having a big effect on workflow system as well as standards in the document management field To help with interoperability the OMG is motivating standards of distributed workflow with the prominent submission being the flow submission which is being readied for voting at this time This talk will cover the elements of flow web based workflow and the trend of new workflow technology for the near future Biography Keith D Swenson is currently Coordination Technology Architect for Netscape Communications Corp in Mountain View California He has just completed his role as architect for Visual JavaScript a high level web application development environment which is now available to the public At Fujitsu Software Corporation he lead the development of Regatta Technology a workflow tool that allows groups of people to collaboratively define the processes that they are involved in while performing the processes now known as TeamWARE Flow Previous positions include project manager for Framework at Ashton Tate and development lead for Open Access at Software Products International He is a past vice chair for the ACM SIG for Group Support Technology SigGROUP He has been elected a fellow of the Workflow Management Coalition having chaired a working group on the Process Definition Interface in the past He has an M Sc in Computer Science with a specialization in public hypertext information systems Workflow Technology and Applications that Leverage the Internet Ra l Medina Mora Senior Vice President and Chief Scientist Action Technologies raul medina mora actiontech com As businesses seek to cost effectively grow revenues through increased customer partner and employee loyalty delivering responsive service is critical Intranets and extranets can help organizations deliver superior service To successfully deploy intranets as a tool to help companies achieve strategic business goals intranet applications must be developed to encompass all necessary parties inside and outside the organization In a world still largely operating in vestigial mainframe development paradigms several principles need to be embraced to realize the full potential of Intranet applications Intranet applications function differently than client server applications because they serve different users customers partners suppliers and other voluntary users Intranet applications are inherently workflow or coordination applications because they need to respond track and enable people to complete actions forother people rather than simply enter data Intranet applications need to be built from open standards so work can cross organizational boundaries rather than remaining desktop applications for primarily managing data In this presentation we will discuss the tools and technologies to design build and deploy successful workflow applications that manage the business process of the organization reaching its customers and suppliers to take full advantage of the intranets and extranets of these organizations We will also exemplify with different scenarios that illustrate the nature of today s challenges that organizations have as they move to capitalize on the new business opportunities that the Internet provides Biography Dr Ra l Medina Mora
