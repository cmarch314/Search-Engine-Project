collecting data you can save locally and then ftp the data to the machine that has the floppy installed in it this c an also be used to get around the floppy drive problem if one machine has a bro ken floppy drive then just use another machine s floppy drive and ftp the files over when you are done besides using mtools you can also mount the floppy drive Mounting a Floppy In order to use floppy disks insert an MS DOS formatted floppy disk into the fl oppy disk drive Then mount the floppy using the commands mount mnt floppy This command will mount a floppy disk under the directory mnt Then use mnt f loppy to refer to your floppy e g ls mnt floppy To manipulate the files in the floppy disk use the same Unix commands as usual e g to copy a file into the floppy disk cp file name mnt floppy When you are done you need to un mount the floppy using the following command umount mnt floppy This will un mount the floppy If you eject before un mounting you will crash the machine Announcement 1
