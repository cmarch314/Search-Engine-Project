On the other hand, there is no standard way to do the\nreverse: look at a URL and determine what it means to the origin\nserver.\n\nDan\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0066.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: what's doable in Web version control\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0064.html\">David G.
