{"text": "Acute Square Triangulation From tromp cwi nl John Tromp Date Wed 23 Oct 1996 17 6 4 GMT Newsgroups sci math Subject nice geometry puzzle I was recently reminded of an old puzzle asking for a subdivision of a square into acute angled triangles So there can be no angle of at least 9 degrees In particular all four corners of the square require bisecting at least An additional challenge is to minimize the resulting number of triangles The answer appears to be eight as witnessed by my PostScript signature This fact may very well have been proven somewhere in the literature let me know if you have a reference I attacked the problem of how to make the angles as acute as possible For an 8 triangle subdivision this leads to an optimization problem involving two unknowns x y being one of the symmetric middle points in a square ranging from 1 to 1 2 and three necessarily equal angles Application of the cosine law results in the simultaneous equations x 2 x y 2 1 x 2 2y y 2 x sqrt 1 x 2 y 2 sqrt x 2 y 2 sqrt 1 x 2 2 y 2 sqrt x 2 2 y 2 With the help of expert Maple user Walter Lioen this gave me the desired solution x y 13 71391155196 379831986484951 corresponding to an angle of about 85 degrees Now I was wondering if a division in more triangles could achieve even more acute angles I discovered that a division in 2 triangles can First divide the square in two along a main diagonal Then subdivide each of the two triangles into 1 smaller ones by adding a small triangle in the middle each of whose corners connects to one of the outer triangle and adding one point on each side of the outer triangle connecting to two corners of the inner one My big question is how do I go about optimizing the angles in such a subdivision It seems to involve three instead of two parameters If we position the outer triangle at 1 1 then the small inner triangle should be positioned at w w x y y x The problem is I m not sure which angles should up being equal when w x y are chosen so as to minimize the largest angle By fixing some angles and optimizing a remaining single parameter I found a solution with all angles smaller than 84 degrees but it seems something close to 8 degrees should be feasible Any help is appreciated regards PS John Tromp http www cwi nl tromp 3 2 translate 2 1 1 26 76 2 2 4 4 26 76 2 4 2 26 76 9 76 moveto lineto repeat scale repeat stroke showpage From eppstein

diagonally in the square as large as possible so that four of their corners touch the square s sides Use as triangulation vertices these four points on the square s sides the two centers of the pentagons on one diagonal of the square and the two points on the other diagonal where the pentagons share a corner The triangulation has six 54 54 72 triangles connecting each pentagon center to three pentagon edges and eight 45 63 72 triangles two at each corner of the square Is fourteen triangles optimal One can t do better than 72 degrees because by some manipulations with Euler s formula any triangulated square has 1 a vertex along a square edge where only two triangles meet 2 a square corner covered by only one triangle or 3 an interior vertex where at most five triangles meet Cases
