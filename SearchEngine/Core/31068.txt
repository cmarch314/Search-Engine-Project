You can make\na directory which will be the root directory of your Chimera website.\nYou can name it anything you like, and place it anywhere you like, but \nif you want it to be visible across the WWW, then you should place it \nin the namespace of your webserver. (In other words, in a directory \nwhere the server will allow outside access.) \n</p>\n\n<p> For the purposes of this tutorial, create a directory called \n<b>chimera_tutorialws</b> (you may place this one anywhere you like).  \nThis will be where you be running the \nChimera website from, and it will eventually contain the data \nfor your website.  Now do the following to start your Chimera Website:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> For Unix Systems do the following:\n\t<br>\n\tFrom the directory chimera_tutorialws start the Chimera\n\tWebsite by executing the program, hyperwebManager.\n\t(Note: this image is from the testing machine used, also \n\tthe command hyperwebManager is provided by chimera.jar)\n\t<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/hwm_start.gif\" WIDTH=\"315\"\n\tHEIGHT=\"75\"></CENTER>\n\n    <li> For Windows NT do the following:\n\t<br>\n\tFrom the directory chimera_tutorialws start the Chimera\n\tWebsite by typing the following in the command line interface:\n\t<br>\n\t<tt>java chimera.hyperwebManager</tt>\n</ul>\n\n<p> Note: The Hyperweb Manager considers the directory where it is started from\nto be the root of your Chimera Website.  Chimera 2.0 distinguishes directories \nbelow the root as hyperwebs.\nPlease start\nthe Hyperweb Manager only in in a directory which you want as the root for your \nChimera Website.  Starting the Hyperweb Manager from another directory \nmay cause a degradation in Chimera's performance.\n</p>\n\n<p> Once started, you should have the following servers appear in your\ndisplay:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> The Hyperweb Manager\n\t<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/hwm.gif\" WIDTH=\"494\"\n\tHEIGHT=\"205\"></CENTER>\n    <li> The Hyperweb Server\n\t<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/hws.gif\" WIDTH=\"494\"\n\tHEIGHT=\"178\"></CENTER>\n    <li> The Applet Server\n\t<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/as.gif\" WIDTH=\"494\"\n\tHEIGHT=\"147\"></CENTER>\n</ul>\n\n<p> Note: The above three screen-shots are from a Unix environment, other\noperating systems will have slightly different window setups.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCongratulations, you have successfully started the Chimera website.\nThese three servers pictured in the screen-shots provide the services \nfor the Chimera Website. You may\nmay now proceed with doing some operations to enhance your website such as\ncreating some hyperwebs so that clients can use Chimera.\n</p>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "id": 31068.0}
