We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids\nto construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding\npattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line\nsegments.\n<p>\n<li><b>Folding a paper strip to minimize thickness</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://erikdemaine.org/\">E.

It turns out to\nbe hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways\nis best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.\n<p>\n<li><b>Contact representations of sparse planar graphs</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~mjalam/\">M.
