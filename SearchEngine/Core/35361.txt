Tony Long 1 The web interface was first implemented by Harry Mangalam Cyber T has received valuable inputs from many UCI biologists in particular from G Wesley Hatfield Denis Heck She pin Hung Michelle Riehle and Suzanne Sandmeyer The program has been maintained and extended by various members of the Baldi group including Yann Pecout Laurence Richard Suman Sundaresh Michael Zeller and Matthew Kayala Cyber T has been ranked by investigators from Harvard University and the Pasteur Institute as the best commercial or public software package for the analysis and interpretation of DNA microarray data 2 The superiority of Cyber T was further demonstrated in other comparison experiments 3 5 In addition to DNA microarray analysis 6 8 Cyber T has been used to analyze other high throughput data including protein microarrays 9 1 and quantitative mass spectrometry data for example 11 Current works in press use Cyber T for the differential analysis of Next Generation Sequencing

is free for academic non commercial research use only The appropriate references 1 should be cited when used for academic research purposes For commercial licenses please contact IGB Licences To work with the Cyber T library written in R directly you need to have R installed There are installation packages available for most platforms and source code that will compile with gcc all available via your nearest node of the Comprehensive R Archive Network Assuming you have R installed on your system just source the bayesreg R file using either the command line interface or the menu What is in the Cyber T library bayesreg R bayesT main function for unpaired two sample t tests both Bayesian and non Bayesian versions bayesT pair main function for paired two sample t tests both Bayesian and non Bayesian versions A paired test is appropriate when controls and experimentals are paired An example of this is Brown type array data where each control has a matching experimental treatment runAllBayesAnova main function for the one way ANOVA both Bayesian and non Bayesian versions An ANOVA is appropriate when there are more than two experimental conditions to analyze An example of this would be array data from more than two different types of tissue ppdeMix main function for running Posterior Probability of Differential Expression analysis runVsn main function to run Variance Stabilizing Normalization VSN pre processing Note The vsn package from Bioconductor must be installed runMulttest main function to calculate Bonferroni and Benjamini Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction Note The multtest package from Bioconductor must be installed postHoc main function to run postHoc tests for the one way ANOVA cyberTPlots main function for plotting the basics of the data The lattice package must be installed The bayesreg R file is well commented It should be easy to use with a minimal knowledge of R Using the bayesreg R code in R Depending on what platform you are running the R code you need to use the menu options and source the bayesreg R file This loads all the functions in hdarray in to R On Windows or Unix like systems you can type source filename at the command line You may also want to use the menu option to change the R working directory to the directory that contains your data Let s assume a simple text file Expt1 txt as follows C1 C2 E1 E2 gene1 1 8 7 9 gene2 6 5 7 6 gene3 4 5 8 9 The following commands demonstrate how to read a data file and invoke the various functions to perform t tests or bayes t tests on either paired unpaired multiple conditions data The R command line prompt may look like this after which you can type the commands shown below Read the data file which in this case is comma separated If the file is tab separated ignore the sep field Do not type the If the data file is not in your working directory you need to specify the full file path Tab delimited file dataFile read table Expt1 txt Comma delimited file dataFile read table Expt1 txt sep Space delimited file dataFile read table Expt1 txt sep Display the first row to make sure the file has been read correctly dataFile 1 C1 C2 E1 E2 gene1 1 8 7 9 As you can see the file has been read correctly Since the first line had column names the file was read correctly as the header Note that there is no header name for the gene name column hence the gene name column is used to label the rows If you don t have the column names it works just fine too R will create its own column names Display the dimensions of the dataset The first number is the number of rows the second is the number of columns dim dataFile 1 3 4 Now that the data has been read we can proceed to apply the various functions Let s apply the standard unpaired t test with bayesT and appropriate parameters bayesT dataFile numC 2 numE 2 ppde bayes The outputs of the code are exactly the outputs from the webserver All parameters in the functions correspond with form elements on the webserver and are documented in the code comments That s it When you apply the commands above the data file gets processed and some output files allgene txt ROC txt mix txt and several png files are saved in your working directory allgene txt contains all the analysis output data png files contain supporting graphs mix txt contains the mixture model parameters and ROC txt contains the x and y coordinates for the ROC plot in temp ps Note some of these files may not get generated depending on the parameters used See the Cyber T results section for details File Format The format expected is essentially the output of a spreadsheet file in ASCII or plain text with the values delimited by tabs commas or spaces If your data are in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program they should be saved as text files and delimited by tabs commas or spaces Make sure that your labels gene names do not include whatever you choose Comments can be inserted anywhere in the text as long as the comment lines are prefixed by a because the underlying R code will ignore command lines beginning with Column headings must be removed unless they are preficed by a sign or specifically excluded by identifying which is data start row Do note that having the sign in the middle of a line without prefixing the line with a will result in errors For example please ensure that none of the gene names in the label column have a in them Missing values are coded as NA not na case matters and values below background are coded as zero There must be at least one label column And columns for the same condition must be contiguous Examples are given below for each analysis type Unpaired two conditions data For this type of analysis where the first condition is a control and second condition is an experimental columns should be in this order Label ControlReplicate1 ControlReplicate2 ExperimentalReplicate1 ExperimentalReplicate2 Of course you can have more than two control or experimental replicates but they must be contiguous You cannot have for example control columns then experimental columns the control columns again Here s an example file here s a comment and another and the line below is also a

For paired data you must upload raw measurements of two conditions with an equal number of replicates Please see the Pairs Help Section for more details of when and why a Paired analysis is appropriate With raw measurements columns should be in the following order Label Cond1Repl1 Cond1Repl2 Cond2Repl1 Cond2Repl2 This means that Cond1Repl1 will be paired with Cond2Repl1 and similarly Cond1Repl2 will be paired with Cond2Repl2 Of course you can have more than two columns per condition but the number of columns in each condition must be equal The Unpaired two conditions data example file from above works as an example for this type of data Multiple conditions data For this type of data the columns for each condition should be contiguous For example with three conditions having two replicates each columns should be in the following order Label Cond1Repl1 Cond1Repl2 Cond2Repl1 Cond2Repl2 Cond3Repl1 Cond3Repl2 Again you could have more than three conditions or more than two replicates each but columns from the same condition need to be next to one another Here is an example file here s a comment and another and the line below is also a comment which is OK to insert Label

The Unpaired or ANOVA approach does no such pairing The difference is that if samples really are paired the variance in the denominator can be much smaller and hence power greater The paired t test evaluates whether the mean difference between paired samples is significantly different from zero whereas the non paired t test tests if the mean of group 1 is different from the mean of group 2 Let s do a classic example Below is the body weight of a group of people before and after some diet regime was applied PERSON BEFORE AFTER DIFFERENCE Joe 2 18 2 Sue 12 1 2 George 175 155 2 Note People here are like replicate experiments and Before and After are like Control versus Experimental Doing a paired t test results in showing the diet is very effective everyone loses 2 lb with no variance that is the mean difference is significantly different from zero On the other hand if we take the Mean of the Afters Mean of the Befores the difference is still 2 however the variance within treatments is large so it is impossible to say the difference is significant Basically when observations are paired the paired approach is the correct and most powerful approach when observations are not paired then we have to use the unpaired approach Reasons for unsuccessful file upload If you can see the file in your browser window you should be able to upload it However some operating systems will refuse to let an already open file be manipulated by another application If this is the case you should get an error message when you try to upload it perhaps even interpretable message Generally you would have to close the window of the file in the other application Erroneous processing of the file could be due to a number of things If you tried to upload a binary file such as a native format Excel file it would be misread by the parsing script and produce gibberish If you confused the stated field delimiters with the actual delimiters For example if you saved your data delimited by COMMAS and indicated that it was TAB delimited or more usually didn t change the default delimiter from WHITESPACE If this happens R will complain about mismatched vector lengths This has often proved to be the case with users of Macs and PCs where many applications allow the embedding of spaces in the label field It s always a good idea to replace spaces with underscores in these cases If you numbered the columns starting at ONE instead of at ZERO Minimum Non zero Replicates Required With the latest version of the Cyber T library even the extreme case of a single replicate can be handled with the Bayesian versions of the analyses In these cases the variance estimates are entirely determined by the background If a single replicate in a condition is given a warning message will be displayed Normalization and Low Value Handling Optional The statistical analyses performed by Cyber T assumes that the data are approximately normal This is often not the case with raw microarray or other high throughput data A common technique is to take the natural log ln of the data before processing However this approach has several drawbacks mainly dealing with the inability to handle negative values An alternative approach called VSN is based on the asinh transform and an assumption of a majority of genes being non differentially expressed 12 The webserver allows for pre processing with optional low value thresholding or offsetting and optional Log or VSN normalizations If a Log or VSN normalization is chosen some plots displaying the effect of the normalization are generated Posterior Probability of Differential Expression Optional To interpret the results of a high throughput data experiments it is necessary to determine the global false positive and negative levels inherent in the data set being analyzed We have implemented a mixture model based method described by Allison et al 13 for the computation of the global false positive and negative levels inherent in a DNA microarray experiment 6 8 The basic idea is to consider the p values as a new data set and to build a probabilistic model for these new data When control data sets are compared to one another i e no differential gene expression it is easy to see that the p values ought to have a uniform distribution between zero and one In contrast when data sets from different genotypes or treatment conditions are compared to one another a non uniform distribution will be observed in which p values will tend to cluster more closely to zero than one Distribution of the p values from the lrp vs lrp data from Hung et al 7 The p values based on a regularized t test distribution of the 2 758 genes lrp vs lrp expressed at value above background in all replicate experiments grouped into 1 bins and plotted against the number of genes in each bin The dotted line indicates the uniform distribution of p values under conditions of no differential expression The fitted model dashed curve is a mixture of a beta and the uniform distribution dotted line That is there will be a subset of differentially expressed genes with significant p values The computational method of Allison 13 is used to model this mixture of uniform and non uniform distributions to determine the probability PPDE p ranging from to 1 that any gene at any given p value is differentially expressed that is that it is a member of the uniform not differentially expressed or the non uniform differentially expressed distribution With this method we can estimate the rates of false positives and false negatives as well as true positives and true negatives at any given p value threshold PPDE p In other words we can obtain a posterior probability of differential expression PPDE p value for each gene measurement and a PPDE p value at any given p value threshold based on the experiment wide global false positive level and the p value exhibited by that gene 6 8 It should also be emphasized that this information allows us to infer the genome wide number of genes that are differentially expressed that is the fraction of genes in the non uniform distribution differentially expressed and the fraction of genes in the uniform distribution not differentially expressed Multiple hypothesis testing correction Optional Standard non Bayesian methods to handle the situation addressed by the PPDE analysis above are to use Bonferroni or Benjamini Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing corrections to obtain q values Bonferroni q values control the Family Wise Error Rate FWER and Benjamini Hochberg q values control the False Discovery Rate FDR One could view these as a frequentist approach to the problem addressed by the PPDE analysis or the PPDE analysis as the Bayesian treatment of the multiple hypothesis testing issue Parameters for the Bayesian Standard Deviation Estimation Optional In calculating the Bayesian estimate of the standard deviation there are two different parameters that the user must set These 2 parameters relate to setting the Bayesian estimate of variance derived from the observed population The t test is used to detect significant differences between the means of two groups relative to the observed variance within groups In a perfect world all micro array experiments would be highly replicated within each experimental treatment Such replication would allow accurate estimates of the variance within experimental treatments to be obtained and the t test would then perform well Microarray experiments are expensive and time consuming to carry out and there is the possibility that both control and experimental tissues will be limiting As a result the level of replication within experimental treatments is often low This results in poor estimates of within treatment variance and a corresponding poor performance of the t test itself This problem can be solved addressed using a Bayesian statistical approach that incorporates prior information in the estimation of within gene within treatment variances Although in terms of strong inference there is really no substitute for proper experimental replication in the case of microarrays many parallel pseudo replicated experiments are carried out on any given microarray i e one experiment for each gene In particular it is possible to use estimates of within treatment variance from a number of genes of similar expression level to stabilize estimates of variance for any given gene More precisely the variance within any given treatment is estimated by the weighted average of a prior estimate of the variance for that gene obtained from of local weighted average of the variance of other genes and the experimental estimate of the variance for that gene This weighting factor is controlled by the experimenter and will depend on how confident the experimenter is that the background variance of a closely related set of genes approximates the variance of the gene under consideration An important property of this Bayesian approach to consider is that in the two limiting cases of complete confidence in the prior and zero confidence in the prior the Bayesian approach is equivalent to simply looking at fold change and testing differences between treatments using the simple t test respectively In the Bayesian approach the weight given to the within gene variance estimate is a function of the number of observations contributing to that value This leads to the desirable property of the Bayesian approach converging to the t test as the experimenter carries out additional replications and thus becomes more confident of the observed estimate of within treatment variance for any given gene 1 Sliding Window Size Indicates how wide you want the window surrrounding the point under consideration to be This sample of the data provides an estimate of the average variability of gene expression for those genes that show a similar expression level It is important to estimate this average from a wide enough level that it is accurate but not so wide of a window so as to average in genes with too different of average expression level A sliding window of 1 1 genes has been shown to be quite accurate when analyzing 2 or more genes with only 1 genes a window of 51 genes may work better 2 Bayes Confidence Estimate Value This is a number from to infinity that indicates the weight give to the Bayesian prior estimate of within treatment variance Larger weights indicate greater confidence in the Bayesian prior smaller weights indicate more confidence in the experimentally observed variance We have observed reasonable performance with the following rule of thumb set the confidence such that the number of experimental observations plus the confidence is greater than 8 If the confidence is left blank or zero then a simple classical t test is performed If there is only a single replicate in a given condition then the standard deviation estimates are completely determined by the prior and a warning is issued to the user If the confidence is set to zero and there is only a single replicate we set a default confidence of 5 and issue a warning to the user One way ANOVA and Post hoc Tests T tests are appropriate for two condition comparisons However with more than two conditions for example given three types of tissues a one way Analysis of Variance ANOVA is the proper way to handle the analysis In an ANOVA the null hypothesis is that all conditions come from the same distribution Therefore if for a given gene we decide to reject the null hypothesis i e the p value is below some significance threshold then we can conclude that the gene is different across conditions However we cannot conclude anything about differences between any pair of conditions For example say we have tissue samples from the liver the heart and the lung If for a given gene the ANOVA p value is less than 5 we can conclude that the gene is differentially expressed between the three tissues However we cannot conclude that the gene is differentially expressed between the heart and the lung To make this determination we must use pairwise post hoc tests In essence post hoc tests examine differences across all pairs of conditions Tukey s Honestly Significant Difference TukeyHSD and Scheffe s Method are available as post hoc test options Note the pairwise post hoc p values are not corrected for multiple testing One should only examine pairwise post hoc p values for those measurements that are significant after multiple testing correction at the ANOVA level Following this step wise procedure should provide sufficient protection against Type I errors due to multiplicity Low pairwise post hoc p values on their own are not indicitave of significant differential behavior Analysis Results The results are presented as a web page The initial results page shows the top 25 data points ranked by p value The complete table and downloadable text file are available via buttons If PPDE analysis was

the 1st or 2nd quantiles respectively have been removed This allows the user to see the true relationship by plotting most of the data in a reasonable scale Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between paired and non paired analyses Non paired experiments are those in which the control and experimental values are derived from separate arrays unlike the paired experiments in which

On Windows or Unix-like systems, you can type \"source(filename)\" at\n      the command line. You may also want to use the menu option to change the R working directory to the directory that\n      contains your data. Let's assume a simple text file 'Expt1.txt' as follows:\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n      C1,C2,E1,E2\n      gene1,10,8,7,9\n      gene2,6,5,7,6\n      gene3,4,5,8,9</pre>\n    <p>\n      The following commands demonstrate how to read a data file and invoke the \n      various functions to perform t-tests or \n      bayes-t-tests on either paired, unpaired, multiple conditions data. The R command \n      line prompt may look like this \"&gt;\" after which you can type the commands shown below.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Read the data file which, in this case, is comma separated. If the file is tab separated, ignore the 'sep' field. Do \n      not type the \n      \"&gt;\". If the data file is not in your working directory, you need to specify the full file path. <br />\n      Tab delimited file:<br />\n      <i>&gt; dataFile&lt;-read.table(\"Expt1.txt\")</i><br />\n      Comma delimited file:<br />\n      <i>&gt; dataFile&lt;-read.table(\"Expt1.txt\",sep=\",\")</i><br />\n      Space delimited file:<br />\n      <i>&gt; dataFile&lt;-read.table(\"Expt1.txt\",sep=\" \")</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Display the first row to make sure the file has been read correctly<br />\n      <i> &gt; dataFile[1,]</i>\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n      C1 C2 E1 E2\n      gene1 10  8  7  9  </pre>\n    <p>\n      As you can see, the file has been read correctly. Since the first line had column names, the file was read correctly \n      as the\n      header. Note that there is no header name for the gene name column hence the gene name column is used to label the \n      rows. \n      If you don't have the column names, it works just fine too. R will create its own column names.       \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Display the dimensions of the dataset.

All parameters in the functions\n      correspond with form elements on the webserver (and are documented in the code comments).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      That's it! When you apply the commands above, the data file gets processed and some output files - \n      <i>allgene.txt, ROC.txt, mix.txt and several png files </i>- are saved\n      in your working directory. 'allgene.txt' contains all the analysis output data. 'png' files contain supporting graphs, \n      'mix.txt' contains the mixture model parameters, and 'ROC.txt' contains the x and y-coordinates for the ROC plot in temp.ps. \n      Note: some of these files may not get generated depending on the parameters used.\n      See <a href=\"/help/#results\">the Cyber-T results section</a> for details.\n    </p>\n</div>\n\n    <hr noshade size=3 />\n    <a id=\"fileformat\"></a>\n    \n\n<div id=\"file-format-wrapper\" class=\"form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui-widget-header\">File Format</h2>\n  <p>\n    The format expected is \n    essentially the output of a spreadsheet file in ASCII or plain text with the\n    values delimited by tabs, commas, or spaces. If your data are in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program,\n    they should be saved as text files and delimited by tabs, commas, or spaces. \n    Make sure that your labels (gene names) do not include whatever you choose.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Comments can be inserted anywhere in the text as long as the comment lines are prefixed by a '#' because\n    the underlying R code will ignore command lines beginning with #. Column headings must be removed unless\n    they are preficed by a # sign or specifically excluded by identifying which is data start row. \n    Do note that having the # sign in the middle of a line without prefixing the line with a # will \n    result in errors.

The Unpaired two conditions data example file from above works as an \n    example for this type of data.\n  </p>\n  <h4>Multiple conditions data</h4>\n  <p>For this type of data, the columns for each condition should be contiguous.\n    For example with three conditions having two replicates each, columns should be in the following order: </p>\n  <pre>\n    Label, Cond1Repl1, Cond1Repl2, Cond2Repl1, Cond2Repl2, Cond3Repl1, Cond3Repl2</pre>\n  <p>\n    Again, you could have more than three conditions or more than two replicates each, but columns from the same \n    condition need to be next to one another.

The difference is that if samples\n    really are paired, the variance in the denominator can be much smaller\n    (and hence power greater).  The paired t-test evaluates whether the mean\n    difference between paired samples is significantly different from\n    zero, whereas the non-paired t-test tests if the mean of group 1 is\n    different from the mean of group 2.  Let's do a &quot;classic&quot; example.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Below is the body weight of a group of people before and after some diet regime was applied:\n  </p>\n  <pre>\n    PERSON      BEFORE          AFTER      DIFFERENCE\n\n    Joe           200            180          -20\n    Sue           120            100          -20\n    George        175            155          -20</pre>\n  <p>\n    (Note: People here are like replicate experiments and Before and After are like Control versus Experimental).  \n    Doing a \n    &quot;paired t-test&quot; results in showing the diet is very effective -- everyone loses 20 lb with no \n    variance (that is: the \n    mean difference is significantly different from zero). On the other hand, if we take the \n    (Mean of the Afters) - (Mean of the Befores), the difference is still 20, however the variance \n    <i>within treatments</i> \n    is large so it is impossible \n    to say the difference is significant.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Basically when observations are &quot;paired&quot; the paired approach is the correct and \n    most powerful approach, when \n    observations are not paired then we have to use the unpaired approach.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n    <a id=\"fileupload\" />\n    \n\n<div class=\"form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui-widget-header\">Reasons for unsuccessful file upload</h2>\n  <p>\n    If you can see the file in your browser window, you should be able to upload it.

When control data sets are compared to one\n    another (i.e. no differential gene expression) it is easy to see\n    that the <i>p-</i>values ought to have a uniform distribution\n    between zero and one. In contrast, when data sets from different\n    genotypes or treatment conditions are compared to one another, a\n    non-uniform distribution will be observed in which <i>p-</i>values\n    will tend to cluster more closely to zero than one.\n  </p>\n  <img src=\"/static/img/p-value.jpg\" />\n  <p>\n    <b>Distribution of the <i>p-</i>values from the <i>lrp+</i> vs.\n      <i>lrp-</i> data from Hung et al. </b>\n    <a href=\"/help/#references\">[7]</a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The <i>p-</i>values, based on a regularized t-test distribution, of\n    the 2,758 genes (<i>lrp+</i> vs. <i>lrp-</i>) expressed at value\n    above background in all replicate experiments grouped into 100 bins\n    and plotted against the number of genes in each bin.

These 2 parameters relate to setting the Bayesian estimate of variance derived from the observed population. \n    The t-test is used to detect significant differences between the means of two groups relative to the observed variance \n    within groups. In a perfect world, all micro-array experiments would be highly replicated within each experimental \n    treatment. Such replication would allow accurate estimates of the variance within experimental treatments to be \n    obtained and the t-test would then perform well. Microarray experiments are expensive and time consuming to carry out, \n    and there is the possibility that both control and experimental tissues will be limiting. As a result, the level of \n    replication within experimental treatments is often low. This results in poor estimates of within-treatment variance \n    and a corresponding poor performance of the t-test itself. This problem can be solved addressed using a Bayesian \n    statistical approach that incorporates prior information in the estimation of within gene within treatment variances. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Although in terms of strong inference there is really no substitute for proper experimental replication, in the case of \n    microarrays many parallel pseudo-replicated experiments are carried out on any given microarray (i.e., one experiment \n    for each gene). In particular, it is possible to use estimates of within-treatment variance from a number of genes of \n    similar expression level to stabilize estimates of variance for any given gene. More precisely, the variance within any \n    given treatment is estimated by the weighted average of a prior estimate of the variance for that gene (obtained from \n    of local weighted average of the variance of other genes) and the experimental estimate of the variance for that gene. \n    This weighting factor is controlled by the experimenter and will depend on how confident the experimenter is that the \n    background variance of a closely related set of genes approximates the variance of the gene under consideration. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    An important property of this Bayesian approach to consider is that in the two limiting cases of complete confidence in \n    the prior and zero confidence in the prior, the Bayesian approach is equivalent to simply looking at fold change and \n    testing differences between treatments using the simple t-test respectively. In the Bayesian approach the weight given \n    to the within gene variance estimate is a function of the number of observations contributing to that value. This leads \n    to the desirable property of the Bayesian approach converging to the t-test as the experimenter carries out additional \n    replications and thus becomes more confident of the observed estimate of within treatment variance for any given gene. \n  </p>\n  <h4>1. Sliding Window Size</h4>\n  <p>\n    Indicates how wide you want the window surrrounding the point under consideration to be. This sample of the data \n    provides an estimate of the average variability of gene expression for those genes that show a similar expression \n    level.  It is important to estimate this average from a wide enough level that it is accurate, but not so wide of a \n    window so as to average in genes with too different of average expression level. A sliding window of 101 genes has been \n    shown to be quite accurate when analyzing 2000 or more genes, with only 1000 genes a window of 51 genes may work \n    better.\n  </p>\n  <h4>2. Bayes Confidence Estimate Value</h4>\n  <p>\n    This is a number from 0 to infinity that indicates the weight give to the Bayesian prior estimate of within-treatment \n    variance. Larger weights indicate greater confidence in the Bayesian prior; smaller weights \n    indicate more confidence in the experimentally observed variance.  We have observed reasonable performance with the \n    following rule of thumb:  set the confidence such that the number of experimental observations plus the confidence is greater \n    than 8.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the confidence is left blank or zero, then a simple classical t-test is performed.  \n    If there is only a single replicate in a given condition, then the standard deviation estimates are completely \n    determined by the prior, and a warning is issued to the user.  If the confidence is set to zero and there is only a \n    single replicate, we set a default confidence of 5 and issue a warning to the user.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n    <a id=\"anova\"></a>\n    \n\n<div class=\"form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui-widget-header\">One-way ANOVA and Post-hoc Tests</h2>\n  <p>\n    T-tests are appropriate for two-condition comparisons.  However, with more than two conditions,\n    for example, given three types of tissues, a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is the proper \n    way to handle the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In an ANOVA, the null-hypothesis is that all conditions come from the same distribution.  \n    Therefore, if for a given gene, we decide to reject the null-hypothesis (i.e., the p-value is below some \n    significance threshold), then we can conclude that the gene is different across conditions.  \n    However, we cannot conclude anything about differences between any pair of conditions.  \n    For example, say we have tissue samples from the liver, the heart, and the lung.  \n    If for a given gene, the ANOVA p-value is less-than 0.5, we can conclude that the \n    gene is differentially expressed between the three tissues.  However, we cannot conclude that\n    the gene is differentially expressed between the heart and the lung.
