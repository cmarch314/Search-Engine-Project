The main idea is to express the\r\nCSP as a factored probability distribution over its solutions and then generate\r\nsamples from this distribution using probabilistic sampling schemes. We suggest\r\nparameterized sampling schemes that sample solutions from the output of a\r\ngeneralized belief propagation algorithm. To speed up the rate at which random\r\nsolutions are generated, we augment our sampling algorithms with techniques\r\nused successfully in the CSP literature to improve search such as conflict-directed\r\nback-jumping and no-good learning. The motivation for this tasks comes from\r\nhardware verification. Random test program generation for hardware verification\r\ncan be modeled and performed through CSP techniques, and is an application in\r\nwhich uniform random solution sampling is required.</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r136a.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n\r\n</td></tr></table></center>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8704.0}
