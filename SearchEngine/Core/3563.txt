Who is this guy? Why do they let him post?\n\n&gt;You can fix (?) this by glueing an\n&gt;additional block onto each of the  12  faces that's in the middle of a\n&gt;coplanar set-of-three.\n\nNice try, but then the central \"hole\" is lined with 4 sets of three coplanar\nfaces. As an alternative, glue an additional block onto each of the 4\nfaces of each of the four corner blocks.\n\n&gt;As you may already know, if you try to build a polyhedron using only\n&gt;regular  n-gons, then the number  m  of them that meet at a vertex is\n&gt;limited; indeed the only combinations are  (n,m)=\n\nThe listed combinations are the only ones which can occur in _convex_\npolyhedra. Of course this does not apply with positive genus.\n\nThose who like this sort of thing will like this book:\n\n    AUTHOR:     Stewart, Bonnie Madison.\n    TITLE:      Adventures among the toroids; a study of quasi-convex,        \n                   aplanar, tunneled orientable polyhedra of positive genus\n                   having regular faces with disjoint interiors ... written,\n                   illustrated and hand-lettered by B.
