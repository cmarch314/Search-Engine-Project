General synopsis </strong></font></a><strong>\r\n<a name=\"subject_1\"><font size=\"3\">for running the utilities implemented in \r\nX-Score</font></a></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Started from version 1.2, a number of miscellaneous utilities \r\nhave been implemented in X-Score. These utilities are designed to help the users \r\nin many ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">The general synopsis for running a certain utility in X-Score \r\nis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>\r\n<font color=\"#FF0000\">xscore</font></strong><font\r\ncolor=\"#FF0000\"><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp; </strong><strong>\r\n-function</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> <i>&nbsp;input_file(s)&nbsp; \r\noutput_file(s)</i></strong></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Here the &quot;-function&quot; flag tells the program what to do. \r\nDifferent functions may require different inputs and outputs, which will be \r\nexplained below.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><a name=\"subject_2\">\r\n<font size=\"3\"><strong>2.\r\nFixPDB: preparing protein molecules in PDB format</strong></font></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">This function is designed to process a given PDB file and \r\nsave it in the correct format for X-Score. It is HIGHLY \r\nrecommended to use a PDB file that has been processed by this function as the <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">RECEPTOR_PDB_FILE</font><font color=\"#000000\">&nbsp; when \r\nrunning X-Score.</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">To run this function:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>\r\n<font color=\"#FF0000\">xscore</font></strong><font\r\ncolor=\"#FF0000\"><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </strong><strong>&nbsp;-fixpdb</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> <i>\r\n&nbsp;the_input_PDB_file&nbsp; the_output_PDB_file</i></strong></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Basically, this function will do the following jobs. (1) Extract \r\nthe information that is useful for X-Score computation from the given PDB file, \r\nincluding sequence and atom information, and sort them in the right format. (2) \r\nIdentify common mistakes in atom naming and correct them according to standard \r\nPDB conventions. If the X-Score program cannot recognize certain atoms, such as \r\na non-standard amino acid residue or a ligand molecule, they will be neglected \r\nand  not written to the output PDB file. (3) Delete water molecules \r\nand inorganic ions that are far away from the protein molecule since they are \r\nirrelevant. (4) Keep only polar hydrogen atoms and \r\nneglecting non-polar hydrogen atoms. (5) Re-number all of the valid atoms, \r\nincluding ATOMs and HETATMs, continuously started from 1. The residue numbers \r\nare kept unchanged so that the users can still find a particular residue \r\nconveniently by its original assigned residue number. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Note that the &quot;FixPDB&quot; function can only refine a PDB file. \r\nBefore applying it, you are still supposed to do some basic editing work, such \r\nas deleting the ligand molecule(s) (if you are working on a complex structure) \r\nand add hydrogen atoms. </p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><a name=\"subject_3\">\r\n<font size=\"3\"><strong>3.\r\nFixMol2: preparing ligand molecules in Mol2 format</strong></font></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">This function is designed to process a given Mol2 file and \r\nsave it in the correct format for X-Score. It is HIGHLY \r\nrecommended to use a Mol2 file that has been processed by this function as the <font\r\ncolor=\"#0000FF\">LIGAND_MOL2_FILE</font><font color=\"#000000\"> when running \r\nX-Score. This is especially important if X-Score is going to be applied to score \r\na library of various molecules.</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">To run this function:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>\r\n<font color=\"#FF0000\">xscore</font></strong><font\r\ncolor=\"#FF0000\"><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </strong><strong>&nbsp;-fixmol2</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\"> <i>\r\n&nbsp;the_input_Mol2_file&nbsp; the_output_Mol2_file</i></strong></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Basically, this function will do the following jobs. (1) Extract \r\nthe information that is useful for X-Score computation from the given Mol2 file, \r\nincluding atom and bond information.&nbsp;(2) Identify errors in atom typing and \r\nbond typing and correct them according to the standard Tripos conventions.  <font color=\"#000000\">Note that this function is \r\nable to identify and correct some common errors in atom typing and bond typing \r\nbut certainly cannot handle all possible situations. We are still working on \r\nthis function to make it more powerful. </font>(3) If the X-Score \r\nprogram does not have proper parameters for certain atoms in the given molecule, \r\nsuch as Be, B, Si, and metal atoms, this molecule will be neglected and will not \r\nbe written to the resulting Mol2 file. </p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><a name=\"subject_4\">\r\n<strong>4.
