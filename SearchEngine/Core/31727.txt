{"text": "Volcanoes on Venus JARtool experiments Data Type image Abstract The JARtool project was a pioneering effort to develop an automatic system for cataloging small volcanoes in the large set of Venus images returned by the Magellan spacecraft This package contains a variety of data to enable researchers to evaluate algorithms over the same images as used for the JARtool experiments reported in Burl98 Sources Original Owner and Donor Michael C Burl MS 126 347 JPL 48 Oak Grove Drive Pasadena CA 911 9 818 393 5345 Michael C Burl jpl nasa gov Date Donated July 9 1999 Data Characteristics The data was collected by the Magellan spacecraft over an approximately four year period from 199 1994 The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar SAR A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at JPL s Magellan webpage Missing Values Some images contain blank black regions which resulted from gaps in the Magellan acquisition or communication processes These regions can generally be ignored Dependencies There are some spatial dependencies For example background patches from with in a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images Image Information The images are 1 24X1 24 pixels The pixel values are in the range 255 The pixel value is related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location Higher pixel values indicate greater backscatter Lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength affect the amount of backscatter Other Relevant Information In addition to the images there are ground truth files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images The quotes around ground truth are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not

The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at <A HREF=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/\"> JPL's Magellan webpage</A>.\n\n<H4> Missing Values </H4>\nSome images contain blank (black) regions which resulted from gaps in the Magellan acquisition or communication processes.

For example, background patches from with in a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images.\n\n<H4>Image Information</H4>\nThe images are 1024X1024 pixels. The pixel values are in the range [0,255].  The pixel value is related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location. Higher pixel values indicate greater backscatter. Lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter. Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength affect the amount of backscatter.\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!  Other Relevant Infomation \n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2> Other Relevant Information</H2>\n<P>\nIn addition to the images, there are \"ground truth\" files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. The quotes around \"ground truth\" are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not permit 100%, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts. There are labels that provide some measure of subjective uncertainty (1 = definitely a volcano, 2 = probably, 3 = possibly, 4 = only a pit is visible).  See reference [Smyth95] for more information on the labeling uncertainty problem.\n</P>\n<P>\nThere are also files that specify the exact set of experiments using in the published evaluations of the JARtool system.\n</P>\n\n<!------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<!  Data Format \n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<H2>Data Format</H2>\n<P>\nThe image files are in a format called VIEW. This format consists of two files, a binary file with extension .sdt (the image data) and an ascii file with extension .spr (header information). There is a MATLAB utility function included in the data package that can be used to read the data.  If you want to use something other than Matlab, you are on your own, but the format is fairly simple and can be understood by looking at the Matlab code.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe labeling files are provided in two forms.
