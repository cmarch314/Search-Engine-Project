The teaching\nassistants are <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~zbecker/\">Zachary\nBecker</a> and <a href=\"mailto:tujohnso@uci.edu\">Timothy Johnson</a>\n(office hours TuTh 11:30-1:00 and 4:00-6:00 in Bren 4061). We also have\na reader, Reza Asadi.\n\n<h2>Lectures and discussions</h2>\n<p>The course meets for lectures Mondays, Wednesdays, and\nFridays, from 3:00 - 3:50, in Bren Hall, room 1100. In addition there\nare two discussion sections, Wednesdays and Fridays 4:00 - 4:50 in SSLH 100. Students are expected to attend discussions regularly. At the discussion\nsections, the teaching assistant will go over homework and midterm\nsolutions, give additional examples of topics covered in the lecture,\nand be available to answer questions.</p>\n\n<h2>Textbook</h2>\n<p>The course text will be \"Algorithm Design\" by Goodrich and Tamassia.\nStudents are expected to own a copy and to read the relevant chapters\nand sections. The official version of the textbook is the one sold in\nthe bookstore. Most homework problems will be assigned from this text.\nIf you are using a different version (e.g., the\ninternational version), then it is your responsibility to make sure you\nare doing the correct homework problems. Additional readings may be given from a free online text, <a href=\"http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/\">Algorithms</a> by Jeff Erickson.</p>\n\n<h2>Homework and grading policy</h2>\n<p>Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (typically posted on this\nweb page on Mondays)\nas well as two midterms and a comprehensive final exam. The overall\ngrade will be determined 10% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and\n40% from the final.</p>\n\n<p>Group work on homeworks is permitted; each student\nshould turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks. Each week's\nhomework assignment will be given on this web page. Homework is due by\n11:59pm on Sundays and must be turned in through dropbox\non eee. No late\nhomework will be accepted. Homework must be typed, and formatted as a\npdf file. Handwritten homework or homeworks in other formats will not be\ngraded. Students who add the class after the start of quarter will be\nresponsible for turning in all earlier homeworks by the following\nFriday. The lowest homework score of the quarter will be dropped from\nthe course average.</p>\n\n<h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Oct 3: Intro/review [Goodrich &amp; Tamassia, chapter 1]<br>\nHomework 1, due Oct. 12: Exercises <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/cs161/hw/hw.pdf\">R-1.2, R-1.3, R-1.6, R-1.7</a></li>\n<li>Oct 6-10: Merge sort; quick sort; comparison sorting lower bounds\n[2.4,4.1,4.3,4.4]<br>\n<a href=\"f14-hw2.html\">Homework 2, due Oct. 19</a></li>\n<li>Oct 13-17: Integer sorting, selection\n[4.5,4.6,4.7]<br>\n<a href=\"f14-hw3.html\">Homework 3, due Oct. 26</a></li>\n<li>Oct 20-24: Divide and conquer, master theorem,\ninteger arithmetic [5.2,10.1]<br>\nHomework 4, due Nov. 2: R-5.4, R-5.5, R-10.9, C-10.3</li>\n<li>Oct 27-31: Hashing, string algorithms [2.5,\n9.1, 9.2; <a href=\"http://11011110.livejournal.com/232567.html\">additional\nreading on hashing with linear probing</a>]<br>\n<a href=\"f14-hw5.html\">Homework 5, due Nov. 9</a></li>\n<li>Nov 3: MIDTERM I</li>\n<li>Nov 5-12: Dynamic programming [5.3,9.4]<br>\n<a href=\"f14-hw6.html\">Homework 6, due Nov. 16</a></li>\n<li>Nov 14-21: Graph representation, traversal, topological ordering,\nstrong connectivity [6]<br>\n<a href=\"f14-hw7.html\">Homework 7, due Nov. 23</a></li>\n<li>Nov 24-26: Shortest paths, minimum spanning trees\n[7]<br>\n<a href=\"f14-hw8.html\">Homework 8, due Nov. 30</a></li>\n<li>Nov 27-28: THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY</li>\n<li>Dec 1: MIDTERM II</li>\n<li>Dec 3-8: Computational geometry [12]; <a href=\"http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/01/rabin-flips-a-coin/\">additional reading</a><br>\nHomework 9, due FRIDAY, Dec. 12: C-12.12, C-12.16, C-12.19</li>\n<li>Dec 10-12: NP-completeness and approximation [13]</li>\n<li>Dec 15: FINAL EXAM, 4:00 - 6:00</li>\n<li>Dec 16: Alternative final exam, 2:00 - 4:00, Bren Hall 3011, by\npermission only (for CSE students with three Monday finals)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Other Course-Related Information</h2>\n\nThe following material is from previous years' offerings of ICS 161.\nSome of these offerings were based on different texts (Baase and\nCormen-Leiserson-Rivest), and covered a somewhat different range of\ntopics.
