I would like to try and work with you on this.\nI do not have this Sarah LANGSAM (now Kendal) in my tree\nyet. Researching Yad Vashem in Israel I think I may have\nfound a nephew to Yakov Rosen: Shlomo Salomon Rosen, a\nnephew to Yakov Rosen (married to a Kendal), submitted\npages of testimony to Yad Vashem in 2000. His address is in\nEin Kerem in Israel and he is a Holocaust survivor. His\nphone number in 2000 was 02/6411948. He states that Yaakov\nperished in 1940 in Strzyzow, Poland and had 4 children.\n\nPlease also contact Suzan Wynne, another LANGSAM descendent\nat srwynne@erols.com. She may have access to certian\nrecords from Poland regarding LANGSAM. I have copied her on\nmy response.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any more information\navailable. Also, can you provide an exact connection from\nyou to Sarah LANGSAM?\n\nLastly, you may want to review the LANGSAM family tree\navailable at my website: www.langsam.com\n\n-Moishe Miller\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n</pre>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\n<HR>\n<P>\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\n<BR>\nMy home address is<PRE>\n           1374 East 28th Street\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\n           USA\n</PRE>\n  \n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 10/3/2013</FONT>\n<P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>", "id": 30944.0}
