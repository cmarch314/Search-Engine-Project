interactive learning application Issues such as media object synchronization error resilient video decoders and audio visual scene composition is investigated MORE Wi Fi Peer to Peer Video Conferencing on PDAs Due to the proliferation of Personal Digital Assitants PDAs the increase in demand for mobile computing and the advancement of pervasive computing we explore the possibility of developing real time multimedia applications rooted in such environments Currently applications providing certain real time services have been reported to be successfully built For example MS Portrait which is capable of deliverying two way live audio coupled with still images will be included in the future Windows PocketPC releases In this project aided by our expertise in video coding and wireless networks we want to advance further by building a real time video conferencing package tailored for PDAs running in Access Grids AGs Due to the numerous limitations of such a practical system we have faced numerous challenges in the project MORE Adaptive Error Resilient Video Encoding IP networks are not designed to provide Quality of Service QoS However a level of QoS is required in the application of real time video We are currently developing a universal encoder initialized error control scheme that guarantees a level of QoS of the received video at the decoder side MORE Video Quality Assessment and Control of MPEG 2 Encoded Bit Streams There exists an increased interest to transmit real time data over the Internet in the form of audio and video Because current networks only provide best effort services real time video performance is generally not satisfactory In this project we adaptively change the video transmission rate according to the feedback of a video quality parameter based on an application level perceptual video quality scheme MORE Performance Study of Broadband Photo and Printing Services BPPS Architecture We study the performance of the Canon Broadband Photo and Printing Services BPPS in order to provide a thorough foundation for technical and business development In order to effectively evaluate the BPPS system a queueing model is built using OPNET a commercial network simulation tool We investigate the impact of sensitive parameters on the BPPS system through comprehensive simulations A performance study is also conducted for upload traffic under customized scenarios from Canon Fair Power Efficient Channel Dependent Scheduling for CDMA Packet Networks We propose a novel scheduling algorithm called Fair Power Efficient Channel Dependent Scheduling which schedules packet delivery to mobile stations in a fair manner while simultaneously taking into consideration the channel conditions for power efficiency for packet data traffic Our performance study indicates that this approach is not only fair and energy conserving but consequently reduces interference as well The algorithm is also extended to real time traffic With added delay information for real time traffic this approach aims at delivering real time traffic in a timely manner while maintaining an even balance between power conservation and fairness Through comparative simulations with two conventional scheduling algorithms we demonstrate that our scheme achieves better overall performance than comparable scheduling schemes Adaptive Power and Bit Rate Control for Multiple Antenna Wireless Communication Systems A current challenge for wireless systems is to provide sustainable high bit rate for real time multimedia applications In this project we propose to achieve an adaptive power and bit rate control The key concept in this research is to exploit the subtle multipath differences in sub channels and treat them differently by adaptively allocating power and or information bit rate to each antenna The outage probability is the main performance metric to reflect the effectiveness of the algorithm Energy Aware Communications With the aid of modern deep submicron technologies complex systems can be designed as a system on a chip Because most of the functionalities are now implemented on a chip small network devices are now a reality Such mobile and wireless network devices need efficient power management in order to conserve as much energy as possible Much research has been initiated in efficient power management We can categorize the work into several levels depending on the power saving objective A system component can be designed to consume less power using low power techniques that focus just on that component An entire hardware system can be managed by following system level power management techniques including dynamic voltage scaling and dynamic power management Work in this research aim to save the energy on a system by using system level information However for devices where the workload of communication components dominates the actual calculation components of a system the energy consumption of a system can be improved by exploiting information obtained from communication behaviors For ad hoc network environments without any infrastructure energy management can also be utilized in order to save the total energy consumption of all the communication of devices in the network In this project we explore the use of communication information to save the energy of the whole system By harnessing power awareness as a major parameter we investigate how to obtain the minimal total energy consumption among communication devices in a network We propose new protocols from the MAC layer to the network layer that facilitate energy awareness in the context of communications between devices Bluetooth based Sensor Network for Civil Infrastructure Monitoring Communicating with sensors has long been limited either to wired connections or to proprietary wireless communication protocols Using a ubiquitous and inexpensive wireless communication technology to create Sensor Area Networks will accelerate the extensive deployment of sensor technology Bluetooth an emerging worldwide standard for inexpensive local wireless communication is a viable choice for such networks because of its inherent support for some of the important requirements low power small form factor low cost and sufficient communication range In this project we outline an approach centered on the Bluetooth technology to support a sensor network composed of fixed wireless sensors for health monitoring of highways bridges and other civil infrastructures We investigate a topology formation scheme that not only takes into account the traffic generated by different sensors but also the associated link strengths buffer capacities and energy availability We also analyze the scheduling routing and healing aspects of the resulting sensor net topology Realization of Wireless Sensor Networks using Ultra Wide Band Technology Ultra Wide Band UWB is an emerging paradigm both in the field of radar applications and digital communications The different technology options available for its realization are summarized below 1 Traditional Impulse Radio approaches sub nanosecond pulse Time hopping PPM Direct Sequence Bi polar modulation Pulsed PAM 2 Non traditional frequency based approaches Pulsed OFDM Pulsed Sub bands The features that make UWB suitable for realising Wireless Sensor Networks are 1 Capacity Possibility of achieving high throughput robustness to co channel interference and narrowband jammers and greater spectrum sharing 2 Low Power and Low Cost Can directly modulate a baseband pulse and no need for mixers or PA allows for CMOS integration of most if not all components high capacity can be achieved with much lower TX power levels and promising for mobile applications low cost low battery usage 3 Fading robustness Wideband nature of the signal reduces time varying amplitude fluctuations fading thus reducing fade margin in link budgets 4 Position location capability Short Impulse wideband signal allows for accurate delay estimates which can be used for accurate position location 5 Flexibility Can easily and dynamically trade off throughout for distance making the technology compatible for a large number of applications based on sensor networks copyright 2 2 3 Video Over IP GroupUniversity of California Irvine", "_id":
