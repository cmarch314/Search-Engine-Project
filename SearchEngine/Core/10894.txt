It's frequently\nused to do interpolations of irregularly sampled data, but\nthat's not my interest.  \n\nSuppose I have a Deluaney triangulation, T, of\nthe set of points which comprise all the intersections between\na set, L, of lines.  T is a set of triangular tiles.\nWhat I need to show is that there is no triangle in T\nwhich is crossed by any of the lines L.\n\nEmpirically I've found this to be true for the cases\nthat I use, but I'm not clear how I'd prove\nit generally -- or if it is not true generally, whether\nthere are any restrictions I can place on L to ensure\nthat it is true.\n\nIf anyone has any comments or can point me to appropriate \nreferences I'd be very grateful.\n\n\t\t\tYours,\n\n\t\t\tTom McGlynn\n\t\t\t<A HREF=\"mailto:tam@silk.gsfc.nasa.gov\">tam@silk.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Hans Kristian Ruud &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:hkr@ifi.uio.no\">hkr@ifi.uio.no</A>&gt;\n<B>Date:</B>           19 Feb 1997 15:34:48 +0100\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Delauney triangulation and points of intersections of lines\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n&gt; Suppose I have a Deluaney triangulation, T, of                          \n&gt; the set of points which comprise all the intersections between          \n&gt; a set, L, of lines.
