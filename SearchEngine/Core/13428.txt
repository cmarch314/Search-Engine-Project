the same subset intersect each other Typically such problems can be solved in quadratic time by constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph bipartiteness testing algorithm we achieve subquadratic times for general objects and O n log n times for balls in R d or simple polygons in the plane by using geometric data structures separator based divide and conquer and plane sweep techniques respectively We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of connectivity testing and provide evidence that for some classes of object connectivity is strictly harder

presented by means of a single input In many cases it is possible to guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a single problem For instance it is possible to find either a 1 approximation to a 1 2 TSP defined from a graph or a n approximation to the maximum independent set of the same graph despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of approximation schemes for 1 2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations better than n1 for independent set However for some other pairs of problems such as hitting set and set cover we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no easier than solving either problem independently talk slides Optimally fast incremental Manhattan plane

Specifically,\nminor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there\nexists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph\nthat can be made planar by removing a single vertex.\nThe minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have\nbounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus\ngraphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the\ntreewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As\na consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and\napproximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed\nefficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar\ngraphs.\n<p>Some of these results\nwere announced in the conference version of\n\"<a href=\"p-psgi.html\">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related\nproblems</a>\" but not included in the journal version. Since its\npublication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of\nproblems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local\ntreewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, \"<a\nhref=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504794.504798\">Deciding first-order\nproperties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>\", <i>J.

For topological subdivisions (cell\ncomplexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,\nbut may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a\nsimple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a\nhexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be\nmeshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,\nconditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the\ntopological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies. \n<p>\n(<a href=\"Epp-ATMCS-01.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Triangles and squares</b>.<br>\nD.
