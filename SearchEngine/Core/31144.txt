Further, it can also help in\nsemantic search queries in image databases (e.g, find all\nNYC photos in my photo collection or find photos where\nI am in front of the Statue of Liberty). Currently most of\nthe consumer photos do not have geo labels or landmark\ntags. However next generation cameras and camera-phones\n(IPhone, Android) can put geo location in image header.\nThese locations can be from satellites or cell towers. The\nonline photo sharing platforms like Flickr, Picasa have increasingly large amount of Geo-Tagged photos. In this\nproject we present an approach for geo-tagging and land-\nmark recognition given the approximate location of a photo\n(e.g., city name like Beijing, Tokyo, Yosemite) and visually\nsimilar images (crawled from Flickr) which were shot in the\nsame approximate location.\n<p>\nFurther, groups of people doing a site-seeing tour often \ncarry multiple cameras between them. It is very reason- \nable to assume that some of those cameras might have geo- \nsensors. Hence another use case would be, given multiple \nphoto streams from the same trips (city tour etc) and given \nthat one of the streams has geo location, can we propagate \nthe geo-coordinates to other photos.\n<p>\nThis was a part of a class project.
