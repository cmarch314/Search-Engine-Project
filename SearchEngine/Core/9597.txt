Following Conway, the rules for a taking and breaking game can\nspecified as a numeric code which describes the number of beans one\ncan take and the number of piles into which one can break a pile.\nThe games which have Conway codes consisting only of the octal digits\n0...7 are known as octal games.\n\nThe theorem of Sprague and Grundy tells us that every instance of an\nimpartial game is equivalent to an instance of the game Nim.  The\ninstances of a taking and breaking game thus specify a sequence of Nim\nvalues.  It is conjectured [R. Guy] that all finitely-specified octal\ngames have ultimately periodic Nim-value sequences, but the conjecture\nis not known to hold even for all octal games with 3 or fewer code\ndigits.  Slightly fewer than sixty of these now remain unsettled.\nWe present techniques for giving computational proofs of the periodicity\nof some of these sequences and consequent periodicity results for three such\ngames.\n\nNo background in the theory of impartial games will be assumed.\n\nThis is joint work with Anil Gangolli.\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 9597.0}
