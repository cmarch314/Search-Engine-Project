a Presidential Young Investigator Award National Chairman for ACM s Special Interest Group on Software Engineering SIGSOFT 1989 1993 Program Co Chair of the 1997 International Conference on Software Engineering ICSE 97 and is an ACM Fellow Bringing Software Architecture into the Software Development Process David Rosenblum Associate Professor Information and Computer Science Irvine Research Unit in Software IRUS UC Irvine dsr ics uci edu Over the last few years there has been increasing recognition that software architecture is an important and distinct characteristic of software that merits its own specialized modeling languages and development tools Researchers in software architecture have defined a number of highly expressive formal languages that can support powerful analyses of architectural models However there has been little effort to date on integrating these languages and tools with the software development processes used by mainstream practitioners In this talk I will first discuss the proper role of architecture within the broader context of the software development lifecycle and then I will describe recent work on integrating architectural description languages ADLs with the Unified Modeling Language UML UML is gaining wide acceptance in industry because of its rich support for object oriented analysis and design processes but it lacks support for architectural modeling and analysis The work I will describe involves extending UML to support architectural modeling with C2 and Wright two of the most widely studied architecture description languages The extensions are defined in a way that allows them to be used in conjunction with existing UML tools Biography David S Rosenblum is an Associate Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Science at the University of California Irvine His research interests are centered on the design and validation of distributed component based software He received a PhD in 1988 from Stanford University and from 1988 to 1996 he was a Research Member of the Technical Staff at AT T Bell Labs in Murray Hill New Jersey He is the author of numerous technical papers on a variety of topics in software engineering He is a member of the ACM and a senior member of the IEEE Coordinator Debra A Brodbeck Technical Relations Director IRUS UC Irvine brodbeck ics uci edu UCI Maps and
