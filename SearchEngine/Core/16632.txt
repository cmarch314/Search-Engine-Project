along depending on our progress and perhaps toward the end your areas of interest I will try to keep the lecture schedule and readings at least a week ahead of us so you ll know to expect at least in the short term There will sometimes be online readings associated with lectures We will generally be talking about them or about the issues raised in them in lecture it s best to do the readings before the lecture so that you can participate in the discussion and get the most out of your time DateLecture TopicsReadingsDueWeek 1Tu 3 3 Course introductionWhere are we going Distinguishing
