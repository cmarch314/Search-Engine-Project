Robert Pettengill and Guillermo Arango This early paper describes a development and maintenance process for a digital document library a k a a collection of WWW content the need to make this process repeatable and as automated as possible and the use of separate maintenance and publications areas for visibility control More relevant to this audience the paper describes the need for using version control on web content the addition of a version to the requested URL and explains the use of CGI scripts to provide versioned access to a document collection Mortice Kern Systems MKS Integrity Engine Integrity Engine Data Sheet MKS has developed HTTP server extensions for checkin checkout and locking operations on specific entities Individual versions of an entity may be accessed by specifying the version with the addition of version at the end of the requested URL The MKS approach described in a white paper makes no modifications to HTTP and instead decorates the requested URL with the information of the desired operation P3 Software web keeper P3 software has performed an integration of the P3 Configuration Management system with the Apache server which P3 has named web keeper thus allowing GETs of versioned URLs on any object within a P3 repository WWW Versioning Support draft proposal v 1 Postscript Jim Whitehead This working draft describes a proposal for extending the HTTP protocol with four new methods FLAG LOCK UNLOCK and USE and describes how they are used to provide style independent versioning with semantics controlled by the client Two appendicies give examples of how the RCS and CVS styles are implemented using these methods The proposal also describes a new entity type the configuration which allows the versions of a collection of related entities to be described in a single file NTT Software Laboratories Palo Alto NTT Software Laboratories in Palo Alto SPLA recently announced on the HTTP Working Group mailing list that they have completed a prototype of an HTTP server which manages versions and configurations of web objects While they apparently have a white paper which is written in Japanese and is currently undergoing translation into English some technical details were reported in the post The versioning and configuration functions were implemented using LINK PUT and related methods Clients which understand how to use these new functions have also been developed The NTT server is written in Perl Two clients were developed one using MetaCard a GUI builder along with a libwww library extended to handle the additional methods The other client was written in Java Authoring Tools Breakout Session at WWW4 Detecting Update Conflicts in HTTP The authoring tools breakout session identified the lost update problem when people performing parallel development on an entity overwrite each other s changes as an open issue requiring attention David Long of NaviSoft and Dan Connolly of W3C subsequently produced a W3C working draft on the lost update problem titled Detecting Update Conflicts in HTTP This working draft presents four levels at which this problem may be resolved do nothing detect lost updates prevent lost updates and fairly prevent lost updates Formal Modeling of a Resource Leasing Extension to HTTP Rafal Boni Rohit Khare and Matthew Levine This paper describes a check out check in scheme for HTTP which aims to guarantee exclusive write access to a resource while it is checked out The scheme described does not handle parallel development of resources The paper begins with a detailed discussion of the four levels of potential resolution of the lost update problem identified at the authoring tools breakout session Using Versioning to Support Collaboration on the WWW Fabio Vitali David G Durand This paper presented at the WWW4 conference presents a different interesting perspective on how versioning of WWW content may be performed Their approach is motivated by how to support asynchronous collaboration in the creation and editing of text documents which they feel requires extremely fine grain versioning This paper describes VTML the Versioned Text Markup Language which is a markup language for describing the version history of a document The VTML approach has the drawback that it only applies to HTML content and does not address the versioning of bitmap images an important class of web content Original Design Issues Versioning Tim Berners Lee The World Wide Web Consortium has an archive of notes dating from the original design of the web in 199 One of the issues is keeping track of previous versions of nodes and their relationships Livelink Library for Document Management Open Text Corporation This marketing blurb for the Livelink Library a component of Open Text s Livelink Intranet product describes web content versioning capabilities including a change history viewing of previous versions and a lock based overwrite protection scheme Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the underlying technical approach from the information presented Distributed Web Content Authoring Tools Microsoft FrontPage FrontPage A Technical Overview Microsoft FrontPage formerly Vermeer FrontPage is an HTML editor which can save work to an HTTP server which has been augmented with the FrontPage server extensions Section C of the FrontPage technical overview describes the FrontPage server extensions in more detail including its use of the POST method for writing content to an HTTP server The Internet Development site at Microsoft offers a wealth of additional material Documents are available which describe Microsoft API calls in the client side to go over the web to talk to server side It also provides access to beta and alpha releases Content changes daily The overview paper is pretty interesting since it may provide a convergence for document objects at a higher level than DMA provides that is cross net delivery of content at the UI object level via OLE America Online PrimeHost AOLpress and AOLserver Documentation for AOLpress and AOLserver The AOL PrimtHost hosting Service formerly known as GNN Hosting Service

service formerly known as the GNN Hosting Service which in turn was formerly known as NaviSoft provides a service for using their AOLpress software to publish web pages on their server for a monthly fee Since you can currently download fully functional but non supported versions of their AOLpress and AOLserver tools it is also possible to experiment with these tools AOLpress employs the PUT method to write content to the AOLserver which implements access control features which control among other methods who can PUT to particular namespaces within the server The documentation for the AOLserver describes how it distinguishes BROWSE PUT MKDIR and DELETE as different administrative rights on operations Netscape Navigator Gold Navigator Gold Data Sheet Netscape Navigator Gold provides authoring of HTML documents along with publishing capability Navigator Gold uses the FTP protocol to write content into the namespace of the HTTP server Hypertext Versioning Literature The topic of hypertext versioning has been researched outside of the WWW context within the academic hypertext community for several years and offers many insights into the WWW versioning problem Versioning of hypertexts was addressed by Ted Nelson in Literary Machines and in Engelbart s NLS journal facility in the 6 s and 7 s This issue was revisited and given renewed importance by Frank Halasz in his extremely influential paper Reflections on NoteCards Seven Issues for the Next Generation of Hypermedia Systems published in Communications of the ACM in July 1988 in which he lists hypertext versioning as issue number 5 These issues were reexamined in a keynote address given by Halasz at Hypertext 91 Proceedings of the Workshop on Versioning in Hypertext Systems at ACM European Conference on Hypermedia Technology ECHT 94 David Durand Anja Haake David Hicks Fabio Vitali The proceedings from this workshop features papers on hypertext versioning in technical documentation legal

Tichy<BR>\nProceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Software Configuration\nManagement, Berlin, Germany, March, 1996.<BR>\n<BR>\nThis paper describes a forms-based interface to the RCE (Revision\nControl Engine, essentially an API to an RCS-like core of functionality)\nwhich allows checkout, checkin, and viewing the version history of\nartifacts in a distributed manner via the WWW.  The system described\nin this paper does not modify the HTTP protocol, instead relying\non custom MIME types (and associated helper applications) along with\npoint-to-point socket connections to handle the file tranfers\nassociated with checkout and checkin operations.</P>\n\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"rd_tri.gif\" ALT=\"==&gt;\">\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~andre/configuration_management.html\">\nConfiguration Management Yellow Pages</A><BR>\nAndr&eacute; van der Hoek<BR>\n<BR>\n\nThis is simply the best one-stop index to the burgeoning SCM tools\nmarket, general information pages on CM, conferences on CM, job\nopenings, public-domain CM systems, consulting, education,\nreviews, and more!
