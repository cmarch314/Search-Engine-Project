of its graph and its treewidth Previously known results imply that planar graphs have bounded local treewidth we characterize the other minor closed families with this property Specifically minor closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there exists an apex graph G that is not in F an apex graph is a graph that can be made planar by removing a single vertex The minor free families that exclude an apex graph and therefore have bounded local treewidth include the bounded genus graphs for which as with planar graphs we show a linear bound for the treewidth as a function of the diameter and K3 a free graphs As a consequence subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and approximations to several NP hard optimization problems can be computed efficiently on these graphs extending previous results for planar graphs Some of these results were announced in the conference version of subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related problems but not included in the journal version Since its publication there have been many more works on local treewidth The class of problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local treewidth was extended and
