You are sure to find multiple courses in your area(s) of interest, courses that not only introduce you to fundamentals but also explore topics in depth. This means undergraduates have the opportunity to study advanced computer science topics usually only offered in graduate programs elsewhere. \r\n                </p>\r\n                \r\n               <p>\r\n               Why are breadth and depth of the curriculum important for you to consider? Some students start college with only a vague idea of what they would like to study \u2013 they should be able to sample the offerings and find their niche. Others enter with a stronger sense of interest in a major \u2013 they should be able to delve in and continue to be challenged. Yet others find that their interests change or become more defined as they move through their major-required courses \u2013 they should not be prohibited from following their dreams. \r\n               </p>\r\n                \r\n              <p>\r\n              Our broad portfolio of courses ensures that regardless of interest, aptitude and talent, or desired career path, you will find what you need. \r\n              </p>\r\n              \r\n              <p>Here is a sample of areas in which we have significant threads of undergraduate courses: </p>\r\n              \r\n       \r\n
