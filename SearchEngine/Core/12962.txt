We show that the\nh-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,\nmay be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,\nwe show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in\ntime O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte\nCaro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for\nsimulation of social networks.

Alternative\ngraph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but\ndo not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing\nmethod that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can\nmatch any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which\nsome of the vertices have 180 degree angles.

Previously superpatterns had\nbeen considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this\nto sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that\nthe 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the\nknown bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation\nsubclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.\nWe apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets\nof points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex\nplanar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct\nuniversal sets of size approximately <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4,\nand we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded\npathwidth.\n<p>\n<li><b>Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play\nplanarity</b>.<br>\nD.
