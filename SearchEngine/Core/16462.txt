{"text": "ICS 21 CSE 21 Summer 2 12 News Course Reference Schedule Lab Manual About Alex ICS 21 CSE 21 Summer 2 12 Final Course Grades Explanation please read this first Please spend a couple of minutes reading this section It will answer many of the questions that you may have about the grading process and will save you a lot of upset waiting for a response to a question asked via email Here are the final grades for ICS 21 and CSE 21 By University regulations at this stage the cutpoints and the grades are non negotiable unless we made a clerical error such as recording a score incorrectly Seriously This means you Despite this warning I often get at least one email that begin with a phrase like I know you said that the cutpoints are non negotiable but There is no but here There were 25 points possible on the Final The average score on the Final was 13 12 52 48 with a high score of 2 How do I know which scores are mine Each student is identified here by a Rank beginning with the highest overall percentage and ending with the lowest In the event of a tie ranks were assigned randomly as their only purpose here is to provide a unique identifier Each of you should have received an email from me at your uci edu email address identifying your rank What do the columns mean Here is an explanation of the various columns The Rank column is a rank from highest to lowest for each student The LabExamX columns indicate your score on each lab exam also listed parenthetically is the number of attempts you made at taking it Note that the number of attempts does not factor into your grade it was fine to take the lab exams as many times as you wanted to The LabExamsPassed column indicates how many lab exams you passed out of the four that were given The Midterm and Final columns contain your raw scores on the Midterm and Final Exam The TotalPct column is your overall percentage in the class figured by adding the weighted percentages of the Midterm and Final columns together as described in the Course Reference The LabExamGrade column lists your lab exam grade as described in the Course Reference The ProvGrade column lists your provisional grade as described in the Course Reference The Grade column lists your overall course grade which is derived by combining your lab exam grade and your provisional grade as described in the Course Reference There are a few words to be said about the selection of cutpoints People are cutpoints whole numbered percentages are not That means that the cutpoint for a particular grade is simply the lowest scoring person who received that grade For the sake of argument if you received a percentage of 54 99 in the class and someone who received a 55 52 received a higher grade than you with no person in between you didn t miss the cutpoint by 1 you missed it by 53 a substantial margin I enjoyed working with you this quarter Enjoy the rest of your summer The grades

By University regulations, at this stage, the cutpoints and the grades are non-negotiable, unless we made a clerical error, such as recording a score incorrectly.  <i>(Seriously!  This means you!

The average score on the Final was 13.12 (52.48%), with a high score of 20.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">How do I know which scores are mine?</p>\n\n<p>Each student is identified here by a <i>Rank</i>, beginning with the highest overall percentage and ending with the lowest.  In the event of a tie, ranks were assigned randomly, as their only purpose here is to provide a unique identifier.

For the sake of argument, if you received a percentage of 54.99% in the class, and someone who received a 55.52% received a higher grade than you (with no person in between), you didn't miss the cutpoint by 0.01%; you missed it by 0.53% &mdash; a substantial margin.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed working with you this quarter.
