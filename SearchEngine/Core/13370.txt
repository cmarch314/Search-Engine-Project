We show that the\nh-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,\nmay be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,\nwe show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in\ntime O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte\nCaro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for\nsimulation of social networks. We also prove\nbounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior\nof the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/subgraphs.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"auth.html\">Co-authors</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> --\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> --\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> --\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
