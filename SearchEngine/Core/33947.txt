If you miss class, please arrange before-hand with a friend to get notes/handouts for you. If you know you are going to miss something important, contact the instructor beforehand. It's much easier to accommodate planned absences. </p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Students are responsible for all material taught in this course.

The mailing list is managed through EEE and details can be found on the materials page for this course. </p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Many other announcements will be made in class as well. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Email correspondence: </p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>To make sure that the class staff (just instructor in this case) see your email, please include the class number, &quot;CS 221&quot; , at the beginning of the subject line. If you do not get a response to the email in 24 hours (except weekends), please resend it or talk to me after class.  </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Late Penalty</p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>Generally speaking the late penalty is 1% per hour after the due date.</p>\n    <p>Due dates are usually 11:59pm local time on the day an assignment is due. </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">&nbsp;</p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\"></div>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Sick Policy </p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>If you find that you are unable to make it to a scheduled event (exam, presentation, etc.) due to sickness, please get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class. In the absence of such documentation, please contact the staff as soon as you realize that you are going to miss a scheduled  event. Generally sicknesses will be treated on a case by case basis. We will accommodate you as best as we can depending on the circumstances. </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Add/Drop: </p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>Electronic Add/Drop only. Standard University time lines apply. I do not waive prerequisites. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Incompletes:</p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p>I will only offer an incomplete grade to a student who, through some unforeseen emergency, is unable to complete the requirements of the course. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p><span class=\"style5\">Academic honesty:</span></p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p> Please familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy: <a href=\"http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm\">http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm</a>. </p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In a nutshell - you may never use anyone else's work without clearly acknowledging the source. This includes code you find on the web, text from books, and answers from friends. If an assignment requires you to do the work yourself, then acknowledging the source of an answer does not fulfill the requirements of the assignment.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Plagiarism is any work that you use that you did not create and do not credit. The ACM publishes a more detailed definition <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/pubs/plagiarism%20policy.html\">here</a>. If you plagiarize another work without crediting the source, you will receive a failing grade for the entire course at the discretion of the instructor.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>This has happened in my courses before, it has happened in conferences that I have chaired and I have sat in conferences in which others have presented my work verbatim. In each of these cases I took the harshest possible recourse available to me at the time. </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>It takes 2 seconds to cite your source. If you want to be intellectually lazy, take a different course. </p>\n  </div>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <p class=\"style5\">Web Page , Readings, and Assignments:</p>\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">\n    <p> The web page for the class is subject to update. Check it frequently and be sure to refresh / reload the Web pages when you browse them.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Please follow the assignments exactly. If you need clarification, ask before the assignment is due. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"container\"><span class=\"style5\">Students with Disabilities or Special Needs:</span><br />\n  <div class=\"indentRight\">Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, religious observance (or anything else) should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. If appropriate, contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</div>\n</div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ntry {\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-15170336-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n} catch(err) {}</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 33947.0}
