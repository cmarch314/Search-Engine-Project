He was about a foot and a\r\nhalf tall, wore blue overalls and a red baseball hat, and smoked\r\na cigar.   We played together from morning until night, except when\r\nhe had to leave to help a stranded motorist.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I was four, my family left New York, and at the time I thought we left America \r\nbehind as well, to settle in New Jersey.  One thing\r\nis for sure, we left Dietz behind and we went our separate ways. From\r\nNew Jersey, we moved to Connecticut. I went to college, moved to\r\nNew Hampshire, started work and got married.  A few years\r\nlater, I moved to California, got a Ph.D., settled down in\r\na real job in suburbia and raised two beautiful daughters\r\nwith a wonderful and loving wife.  I completely lost track\r\nof Dietz, although every once in a while, I thought I detected the faint\r\nodor of his cigar.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA few years back, I planned to take a flight out of Orange County\r\nAirport when the flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems.\r\nThey put me on a shuttle bus on an terrible stormy day to catch a\r\nflight from Ontario Airport.  As we approached the airport, I saw a\r\nsign through the gloom that read \"Dietz Towing.\"  I was thrilled to\r\nsee my old friend had also moved to California.  I resisted the\r\ntemptation to miss the flight and catch up on old times.\r\n\r\n<p>After I returned I always planned to stop in on Dietz, but never\r\nfound the time. I was always too busy with my work as chairman of a\r\nlarge academic department. A few times I had to drive by Ontario and I\r\nalways secretly hoped my car would break down so Dietz could come to\r\nmy aid.  Once I drove by with the gas tank precariously near empty.\r\n\r\n<p>After five years, I decided to step down as chairman so I could\r\nhave more time to pursue my research interests and spend time with my\r\nfamily and friends.  This seemed like the perfect opportunity to catch up\r\nwith Dietz.  One Sunday morning, Father's Day in fact, I talked my\r\nwife into going out to Ontario with me to see what had become of\r\nDietz.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n \r\n<a href=Dietz.jpg><img src=Dietz5.jpg></a><br>\r\nAs we approached the shop, I was a little disappointed.\r\nDietz isn't located in the best part of town, and his shop\r\nisn't the largest.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<a href=Mike.jpg><img src=Mike5.jpg></a><br>\r\nThe shop was closed and surrounded by barbed wired.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<a href=Phone.jpg><img src=Phone5.jpg></a><br>\r\nI tried calling, but he didn't answer.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<a href=Size.jpg><img src=Size5.jpg></a><br>\r\nWhen we went around the side, I was finally impressed.\r\nDietz no longer had a single tow truck, but a whole fleet.\r\nHe had the largest tow truck I've ever seen.  I bet he\r\ncan tow ten tow trucks with that truck.\r\n<hr>\r\n<a href=Chris.jpg><img src=Chris5.jpg></a><br>\r\nSome may mock me or humor me, but I plan on going out to see Dietz when he is open real soon.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Dietz Towing on the web</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\nDietz Towing<br>\r\n1300 E Holt Blvd, Ontario, CA 91761-2191 <br>Phone: (909)986-2703<br>\r\n<a href=http://www.mapsonus.com/bin/maps-maponly/usr=~394e7539.2fdf2.3efd.5/>Map</a>|<a href=http://www.mapsonus.com/bin/maps-planroute/usr=~394e75b5.333d5.437c.5/>Directions</a>|<a href=http://www.switchboard.com/bin/cginbr.dll?L=Dietz+Towing&S=CA&CHKLIST=2&SEQ=00&BUS=1165946&SK=00&TTL=Name&MEM=1&APPID=999945&ACTION=Standard&TYPE=1050>What's Nearby</a>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=http://www.ci.ontario.ca.us/minutearchives/1997/970121.htm>\r\nDietz Towing becomes a designated police towing service in Ontario, Jan 21, 1997.</a>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=http://www.ontario.org/memcd.html>Dietz Towing listing in Ontario Chamber of Commerce</a>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.asp?S=13&T=1&X=276&Y=2355&Z=11&W=1> \r\nUSGS Aerial Photograph, June 1994 </a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dietz Weather</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/Ontario.html\">\r\n<img src=\"http://banners.wunderground.com/banner/default/US/CA/Ontario.gif\"\r\n alt=\"Click for Ontario, California Forecast\" height=60 width=468></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ADDRESS>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pazzani\">Michael Pazzani</A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">Department of Information and Computer Science,</A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">University of California, Irvine</A><br>\r\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425 <br>\r\n<A href=\"mailto:pazzani@ics.uci.edu\">pazzani@ics.uci.edu </A>\r\n</ADDRESS>\r\n</BODY></HTML>", "id": 32925.0}
