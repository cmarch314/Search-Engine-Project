However, a common practice is to store multiple\nconformers in these files. OEChem supports a rather advanced mechanism for recovering\nthese <i>separate</i> conformers into a single, multi-conformer OEMol.  Note that this\ndoes not apply to file formats where conformers are stored together. For example, all\nmolecules in old OEBinary file are multi-conformer molecules. New OEBinary (.oeb) stores\neither single conformer or multi-conformer molecules explicitly so the file itself\ndetermines how to deal with conformers.  Additionally, file formats that have no\nnotion of conformers (<i>i.e.</i> SMILES files) are also unaffected by this feature.\n\n<P>\nIn early versions of OEChem, the default behaviour for reading into an OEMol was to\nattempt to combine conformers of the same molecules together into a single OEMol. This\nis no longer the default, but is instead something controlled by the programmer.\n\n<P>\noemolistreams have a method, <code>SetConfTest</code>, that sets a functor to be\nused to compare the graphs of incoming molecules to determine whether to combine them.\nThese functors are instances of OEConfTest. Several predefined versions include:\n\n<P>\n<DL>\n<DT><STRONG>OEDefaultConfTest</STRONG></DT>\n<DD>Never combine connection tables into multi-conformer molecules.\n\n<P>\n</DD>\n<DT><STRONG>OEIsomericConfTest</STRONG></DT>\n<DD>This implementation of OEConfTest combines subsequent connection tables\ninto a multiconformer molecule if they:\n\n<OL>\n<LI>Have the same title (optional)\n</LI>\n<LI>Have the same numbers of atoms and bonds in the same order\n</LI>\n<LI>Each atom and bond must have identical properties with its order\ncorrespondent in the subsequent connection table\n</LI>\n<LI>Have the same atom and bond stereochemistry\n</LI>\n</OL>\n\n<P>\nNo change to the connection table are made.\n\n<P>\nThe constructor for OEIsomericConfTest has a default argument for whether\nor not to compare titles.  If the constructor is called with no arguments\nor with the argument true, the titles will be required to be the same.\nOtherwise, the titles will not be compared.  In the latter instance, each\nconformer will have the individual title of its original connection table\nand the multiconformer molecule will reflect the title of the active\nconformer.\n\n<P>\n</DD>\n<DT><STRONG>OEAbsoluteConfTest</STRONG></DT>\n<DD>This implementation of OEConfTest combines subsequent connection tables\ninto a multiconformer molecule if they:\n\n<OL>\n<LI>Have the same title (optional)\n</LI>\n<LI>Have the same number of atoms and bonds in the same order\n</LI>\n<LI>Each atom and bond must have identical properties with its order\ncorrespondent in the subsequent connection table\n</LI>\n</OL>\n\n<P>\nThis conformer test sets all fully specified isomeric values to UNDEFINED.\n\n<P>\nThe constructor for OEAbsoluteConfTest has a default argument for whether\nor not to compare titles.  If the constructor is called with no arguments\nor with the argument true, the titles will be required to be the same.\nOtherwise, the titles will not be compared.

In addition, all fully specified isomeric values are set to\nUNDEFINED.\n\n<P>\n</DD>\n</DL>\n\n<P>\nThe following example will attempt to read multi-conformer molecules\nfrom an input file based on OEAbsoluteConfTest. Note that creating the\ninstance of OEAbsoluteConfTest with the default constructor argument\n(0 or false), allows conformers to be combined when they have\ndifferent titles. This is very useful when dealing with files created\nby programs that modify molecule titles to indicate conformer number\n(<i>i.e.</i> acetsali_1, acetsali_2, acetsali_3). The resulting\nmulti-conformer molecule will have the title associated with the first\nconnection table read from the file.\n\n<P>\n<dl><dd><pre class=\"verbatim\">#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom openeye.oechem import *\n\nifs = oemolistream('mcdrugs.sdf')\nifs.SetConfTest(OEIsomericConfTest())\n\nfor mol in ifs.GetOEMols():\n    print '%s has %d conformers' % (mol.GetTitle(), mol.NumConfs())\n</pre></dl>\n\n<P>\n\n<DIV CLASS=\"navigation\">\n<p><hr>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node20.html\"><img src=\"../icons/previous.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Previous Page\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node16.html\"><img src=\"../icons/up.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Up One Level\"></A></td>\n<td rowspan=2><A HREF=\"node22.html\"><img src=\"../icons/next.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Next Page\"></A></td><td width=\"100%\" rowspan=\"2\"> </td>\n<td valign=\"center\" align=\"right\" height=\"56\" background=\"../icons/title_bkgd.gif\" colspan=4 class=\"navigation\">OEChem - Python Theory Manual\n<BR>\nVersion 1.3.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_1.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"contents.html\"><img src=\"../icons/contents.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Contents\"></A></td>\n<td><img src=\"../icons/spacer_2.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><A href=\"genindex.html\"><img src=\"../icons/index.gif\"\n  border=\"0\" alt=\"Index\"></A></td>\n</tr></table>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Previous:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node20.html\">4.4 Molecule Input and</A>\n<b class=\"navlabel\">Up:</b> <a class=\"sectref\" HREF=\"node16.html\">4.
