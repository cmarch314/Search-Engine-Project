Assignments be scored for each category (from 1 to 4), yeilding a maximum score of 16 points. A detailed grading rubic can be seen <a href=\"rubric.pdf\">here</a>. Note that we will use a custom rubric for each assignment.\n\n    <h1>Additional Hints</h1>\n\n    Here is a letter from Weng Ng, a long-time TA for the course, specifying additional hints for success:\n\n<p> Dear students, before you start submitting assignments, I would like to\nprovide some tips (garnered from several quarters of being a TA for this\ncourse) you might find useful for ensuring a good grade on your assignments:\n\n    <p> [1] I will be grading your assignments, so you can be sure the following\npoints will be highly relevant to your success in this course.\n\n    <p> [2] I have a very low level of tolerance for mechanical errors of English.\nThere are a few reasons for this:\n\n    <p> (a) All of you should already have had a lower division writing course,\nwhich should have dealt adequately with basic mechanics of English.\n\n    <p> (b) Most mechanical errors can be caught by careful proofreading and\nediting. It's really just a matter of putting in some time and effort.\n\n    <p> (c) Such errors prevent me from assessing the content of your work properly.\n\n    <p> I am not expecting a perfect piece of writing, but if your work exhibits a\nsignificant number of mechanical errors, you will be given a very low grade,\nregardless of the strength of its content. So please proofread very\nthoroughly before submitting your work. If you do not have a strong command\nof English, have a friend proofread your work, or approach LARC for help.\n\n    <p> [3] Do not write overly long sentences. If you cram too much information\ninto one sentence, it becomes hard to read, parse and comprehend. Break long\nsentences up into smaller, simpler ones wherever appropriate.\n\n    <p> [4] Do not pad your work. For example, adding lots of redundant words to\nsentences, or repeating the same point over and over under different guises.\nIf you do not have enough material to fill up the requisite number of pages,\nmost likely you have not researched or thought through the topic\nsufficiently before beginning to write. So you need to plan out your writing\na little more; padding it will not solve the problem. I would rather that\nyou write less than the required number of pages, than ramble on just to\nfill up the space.\n\n    <p> [5] Do not write in the same way that you speak. Normal speech tends to\ncontain many redundant words. If you do not believe me, have a friend record\na sample of you speaking normally and listen to it afterward. Most of the\ntime this is not a big deal since speech is usually heard in real-time, so\nredundant words are not so noticeable. But in writing, redundant words stick\nout like sore thumbs, and are very tedious to read. So you should watch out\nfor this tendency, and aim for tight, focused writing.\n\n    <p> So I hope not to see any of the things I warned against in your work. If you\nhave further questions feel free to ask me.\n\n    <p> Regards Weng Ng\n\n\n    <hr>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n", "id": 985.0}
