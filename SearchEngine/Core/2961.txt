We\nfocus on the popular paradigm of scanning-window templates defined on\noriented gradient features, trained with discriminative classifiers. We\ninvestigate the performance of mixtures of templates as a function of\nthe number of templates (complexity) and the amount of training data. We find that\nadditional data does help, but only with correct regularization and treatment\nof noisy examples or \"outliers\" in the training data. Surprisingly, the\nperformance of problem domain-agnostic mixture models appears to saturate\nquickly (~10 templates and ~100 positive training examples per template).\nHowever, compositional mixtures (implemented via composed parts) give\nmuch better performance because they share parameters among templates,\nand can synthesize new templates not encountered during training. This suggests there is still room to\nimprove performance with linear classifiers and the existing feature space\nby improved representations and learning algorithms.\n<br>\n<br>\nPASCAL VOC 10x <a href=\"http://vision.ics.uci.edu/datasets/\">[dataset]</a><br>\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/ZhuVRF_BMVC_2012/ZhuVRF_BMVC_2012.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nXiangxin Zhu, Carl Vondrick, Deva Ramanan, and Charless&nbsp;C.
