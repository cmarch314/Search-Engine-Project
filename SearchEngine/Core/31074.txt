These will be demonstrated  \nlater in the tutorial.  \n</p>\n\n<H3> Starting Jimage on different platforms</H3>\n\n<p>\nTo run Jimage, start it by using the Java interpretor.  \n(Be sure that both the Hyperweb Manager and \nthe Chimera Server are running.  This is not critical, but since \nyou are using this example to use Chimera, you will not be able to \nconnect to the Chimera hyperweb you are interested in.)  \n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> On Unix platforms, enter:\n\t<br>\n\tjava jimage.jimage\n\t<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/jimage_start.gif\" WIDTH=\"299\"\n\tHEIGHT=\"62\"></CENTER>\n\n    <li> On Windows NT, use the command line interface and enter:\n\t<br>\n\tjava jimage.jimage\n\n</ul>\n\n<p> Jimage will come up as the following window:\n</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"images/jimage_started.gif\" WIDTH=\"350\"\nHEIGHT=\"150\"></CENTER>\n\n<p> Note: When Jimage starts, it looks for the Chimera Server.  If \nthe Chimera Server is running, it will connect with it.  The three\nstatus bars on the bottom indicate that Jimage is connected to a\nChimera Server, a web, and an active link.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe window for Jimage will look slightly different depending\non the platform you are using.\n</p>\n\n<p> Jimage is now up and running. You will need to some gif and jpeg images \nfor the program.  There are some particular images used by this\ntutorial.  Please download them.\n</p>\n\n<H3>Downloading Images for this Tutorial</H3>\n\n<p>\nThere are some images available to be downloaded from:\n<br>\n<A HREF=\"download.html\"> Download page for the Tutorial</A>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe will use the following two images for this tutorial:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li> bill.gif\n    <li> earthrise.gif\n</ul>\n\n<p> Place them anywhere you wish in your account.\n</p>\n\n<H3>Using Jimage to display the Images</H3>\n\n<p>\nTo use Jimage to display the two images, use the Load image command in the\nFile Menu.
