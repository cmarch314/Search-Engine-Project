arXiv 13 8 6824 21st Int Symp Graph Drawing Bordeaux France 2 13 Lecture Notes in Comp Sci 8242 2 13 pp 352 363 A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by smooth paths in the drawing We define a variant of confluent drawing strict confluent drawing in which a smooth path between two vertices if it exists must be unique We show that it is NP complete to test whether such drawings exist in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open Additionally we show that finding outerplanar drawings in which the points are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it with a fixed

outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement a collection of curves topologically equivalent to lines each crossing at most once but possibly zero times with all crossings belonging to an infinite face can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement As a consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane with each pseudoline represented as a convex piecewise linear curve with at most two bends In contrast for arbitrary pseudoline arrangements a linear number of bends is sufficient and sometimes necessary Small superpatterns for dominance drawing M J Bannister W E Devanny
