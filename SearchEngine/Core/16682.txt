for Software Engineering CSE University of Southern California USC neno sunset usc edu The Unified Modeling Language UML is a family of design notations that is rapidly gaining widespread acceptance as a de facto standard design language UML provides a variety of useful capabilities to the software designer including multiple interrelated design views a semi formal semantics expressed as a UML meta model and an associated language for expressing formal logic constraints on design elements However UML currently lacks support for capturing representing expressing and exploiting certain architectural concerns whose importance has been demonstrated through research on software architectures In particular UML lacks direct support for modeling and exploiting architectural styles explicit software connectors and global architectural constraints This talk will discuss three possible strategies to support such architectural concerns within UML the first strategy involves using UML as is the second strategy constrains the semantics of certain UML constructs to model architectural concerns finally the third strategy augments UML to provide native support for architectures in UML I will discuss the applicability strengths and weaknesses of the three strategies and lessons learned in applying them to several existing architectural approaches Biography Nenad Medvidovic is an

UML provides a variety of useful capabilities to the software\ndesigner, including multiple, interrelated design views, a semi-formal\nsemantics expressed as a UML meta model, and an associated language for\nexpressing formal logic constraints on design elements. However, UML \ncurrently lacks support for capturing, representing, expressing, and\nexploiting certain architectural concerns whose importance has been\ndemonstrated through research on software architectures. In particular,\nUML lacks direct support for modeling and exploiting architectural \nstyles, explicit software connectors, and global architectural \nconstraints. This talk will discuss three possible strategies to support\nsuch architectural concerns within UML: the first strategy involves \nusing UML as is; the second strategy constrains the semantics of certain\nUML constructs to model architectural concerns; finally, the third \nstrategy augments UML to provide \"native\" support for architectures in \nUML.
