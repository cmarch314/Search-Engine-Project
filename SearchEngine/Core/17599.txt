The scale models are in the main in a ratio of 1:15 and the exhibits are positioned to replicate their geographical locations.</p>\n        <p>Here you can see replicas of many of the most famous Chinese buildings and landmarks and a great deal of attention has been paid to detail so as to ensure the miniatures truly represent their originals. This has entailed making full use of the services of architectural specialists and landscape experts who are actively engaged with research and conservation at the actual sites that have been replicated here. The exhibits are surrounded by pleasant gardens with many flowers and trees. Consequently walking in Splendid China can be very relaxing. Apart from the miniature buildings and scenic spots, one may see over 50,000 ceramic figures in the different locations. Splendid China is divided into two parts, a Scenic Spot Area and a Comprehensive Service Area.</p>\n        <p>China is a big and united family made up of 56 ethnic groups. Geographically speaking, they are distributed in different parts of China with the resulting difficulty of experiencing each ethnic group's architecture, their festivals and tasting their snacks during one of your visits. But the China Folk Cultural Village, lying at the Overseas Chinese Town, Shenzhen, will help solve this problem. It is the first spot in China where you can learn of the folk cultures of China.
