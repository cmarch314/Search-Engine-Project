feature the structure of team owners, sponsorships, leagues, prize money, and star players that have long been familiar in physical sport competitions. \u00a0But because these competitions are played in a virtual environment, control of rights to the matches is anything but familiar. \u00a0Ownership issues were highlighted in a recent high profile dispute between Blizzard corporation and the Korean e-sports players association, when the latter attempted to negotiate television broadcast rights for tournaments played on Blizzard&#8217;s StarCraft platform. \u00a0As e-sports become increasingly established \u00a0in the United States and Europe, unsettled questions of copyright, right of publicity, and neighboring rights will need to be resolved among players, team owners, and developers of e-sports.</p>\n<p>Dan L. Burk is Chancellor\u2019s Professor of Law at theUniversityofCalifornia,Irvine, where he is a founding member of the law faculty.\u00a0 An internationally prominent authority on issues related to high technology, he lectures, teaches, and writes in the areas of patent, copyright, electronic commerce, and biotechnology law.\u00a0 He is the author of numerous papers on the legal and societal impact of new technologies, including articles on scientific misconduct, on the regulation of biotechnology, and on the intellectual property implications of global computer networks.\u00a0Professor Burk holds a B.S. in Microbiology (1985) from Brigham Young University, an M.S. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (1987) from Northwestern University, a J.D. (1990) from Arizona State University, and a J.S.M. (1994) from Stanford University.\u00a0Prior to joining the faculty at UC Irvine, he taught at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0 He has served as a legal advisor to a variety of private, governmental, and intergovernmental organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union Committee on Patent Policy and the OECD Committee on Consumer Protection.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- end content -->\r\n\r\n<div id=\"sidebar\">\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li id=\"linkcat-2\" class=\"widget widget_links\"><h2 class=\"widgettitle\">Blogroll</h2>\n\t<ul class='xoxo blogroll'>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.artisallwehave.com\" rel=\"colleague co-resident\" title=\"Antoinette Lafarge&#8217;s blog\">ArtIsAllWeHave</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.itofisher.com/mito/\" rel=\"colleague co-resident\" title=\"Mimi Ito&#8217;s blog\">Itofisher</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://metaverseink.com/blog/\" rel=\"colleague co-resident\" title=\"Crista Lopes as Diva Canto&#8217;s blog (OpenSimulator)\">Metaverse Ink Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pomo2k.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"colleague co-resident\" title=\"Holly Poe Durbin&#8217;s costume design blog\">Pomo2k</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.clubs.uci.edu/vgdc/blog/\" title=\"UCI Video Game Developer&#8217;s Club\">UCI VGDC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.virtualpolitik.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"colleague neighbor\" title=\"Liz Losh&#8217;s blog\">Virtual Politik</a></li>\n\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n<li id=\"archives-3\" class=\"widget widget_archive\"><h2 class=\"widgettitle\">Archives</h2>\t\t<ul>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2012/11/'>November 2012</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2012/10/'>October 2012</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2012/09/'>September 2012</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2012/05/'>May 2012</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2011/04/'>April 2011</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2011/02/'>February 2011</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2011/01/'>January 2011</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2010/08/'>August 2010</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2010/04/'>April 2010</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2009/11/'>November 2009</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2009/09/'>September 2009</a></li>\n\t<li><a href='http://cgvw.ics.uci.edu/2009/07/'>July 2009</a></li>\n\t\t</ul>\n</li>\t</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- end sidebar -->\r\n\t<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- end page -->\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<div id=\"footer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"left\">Copyright (c) 2008\r\n\t\tCenter for Computer Games &amp; Virtual Worlds\t\tAll rights reserved.</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"right\"> Design by <a href=\"http://www.nodethirtythree.com/\">NodeThirtyThree</a> + <a href=\"http://www.freewpthemes.net/\">Free WordPress Themes</a> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;\r\n\t\tPowered by <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 1771.0}
