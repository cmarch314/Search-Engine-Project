Uncertainty in Software Engineering This maxim recognizes the abundance of software uncertainties and their relations and impacts on process decisions and risk management Also as corollary it is suggested that software development include the search identification modeling and management of software uncertainties Defining an approach to explicitly model uncertainty using software belief networks This approach is anchored in a Bayesian interpretation of relationships and dependencies among software artifacts It includes notions of human judgment confidence belief and evidence often ignored by software modeling techniques Implementing the SoftBayes Java applet This applet allows software systems to be defined as graphs of related artifacts and to be annotated with uncertainty information Once defined software belief networks are subject to Bayesian updating using a core engine such as provided by JavaBayes Conducting a case study to substantiate the maxim above and to evaluate the applicability of Bayesian belief networks to a real software project Results of the CEquencer study indicate that explicit modeling of software uncertainties improves developers ability to identify and track changes to levels of confidence in software artifacts and relations Finally several confidence factors were identified as influencing expert s beliefs in software requirements Recording those confidence factors is deemed beneficial to future similar projects where requirements uncertainty is captured explicitly Several impediments and limitations of our approach were observed including the initial cost of obtaining prior belief values the need to ensure that software belief networks retain causality and variable independence and the assumption that software developers domain experts and related project information are available and accessible Our experience in using Bayesian networks for software uncertainty modeling specifically for the CEquencer system indicates that The conceptual view of both software systems and Bayesian networks as interrelated webs of nodes and links seems to offer a convenient metaphor that also maps well into subsequent design and implementation Specifically early depictions of CEquencer artifact webs were developed as Java applets and placed on the World Wide Web see Ziv97 these applets were then viewed and reviewed by Beckman developers for accuracy and relevancy The CEquencer system like most other software proved to be fraught with uncertainties thereby confirming our suspicions for at least one real life system Specifically CEquencer software embodies many often subtle problem domain uncertainties including uncertainties stemming from laws of physics and chemistry in the software s operational environment as well as from vaguely defined boundaries between software versus hardware components Our notion of software uncertainties was well received by Beckman developers offering convenient means in which to describe their confidences and beliefs regarding CEquencer software The CEquencer requirements analyst has recently incorporated confidence levels into her requirements capture process The questionnaire session at Beckman revealed that for the given set of questions a significant difference between the means of the subjects scores was identified This suggests that subjects ability to answer the questions increased with the addition of confidence level information This confirms a statistically significant relationship between the availability of confidence level information and developers ability to trace and track software artifacts and related confidences Next Future Work Up Conclusions and Future Work Previous Conclusions and Future Work Hadar Ziv Fri Jun
