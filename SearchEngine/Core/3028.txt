Description This invited workshop aims to bring together researchers and designers from academia and industry to discuss directions in the development of high performance parallel distributed and multimedia processors and systems The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler operating system and application experts The main goal of the workshop is to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and software systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects about software systems and by software writers about architecture The increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased interaction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately assess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems The main themes of the workshop are application requirements and characteristics compiler architecture interaction and codesign and software and technology driven and constrained new architectures Numerical and non numerical applications in particular database data mining Web and Java based applications are of interest In all cases a longer term view and assessment of the future is of most interest This year we will concentrate on computation and memory intensive applications i e applications requiring more CPU power more memory bandwidth and lower memory latency than present or projected systems can provide Workshop topics of interest will deal with this type of applications and include but are not limited to Application characteristics Their requirements and impact on system architecture and compilation Approaches to better map applications algorithms to systems with traditional architecture memory hierarchy Application community s view of whether the architectural limitations are fundamental or can be overcome by the use of different new algorithms New architectural approaches to application problems as perceived by architects Modeling benchmarking and performance evaluation of such applications Additional workshop areas of interest include the perennial favorites below but preference will be given to submissions on the above mentioned topics Clusters SAN and FibreChannel based systems PC based parallel computing Single chip multiprocessors multi chip servers and large scale multiprocessors Memory technology and system organization Systems On a Chip SOC Java based computing The workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations with discussion Presentations will be limited to 15 min to provide sufficient time for discussion An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future directions rather than recently obtained results Speculation is encouraged Workshop participation is capped at 5 invitees RSVP by Sept 3 th 1999 if you plan to attend Submission and Publication An extended abstract up to 3 pages should be submitted by 1 1 99 Submissions should electronic and in postscript or pdf format Papers will be refereed on the basis of the extended abstract and accepted for either regular or short presentation Authors will be notified about paper acceptance by Oct 21 1999 Full papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting The full papers will undergo an additional review process The following set of LaTex macros should be used in preparing the paper Additional

Car pooling will also be possible.\n<br>\n<li>\nThe workshop hotel is the <b> Maui Prince </b> where we have a special rate contract ($130). Reservations have to be made by 10/15 and will require a 2 night deposit (can be cancelled without penalty up to a week before arrival).  Phone number for reservations is <b> (800)-321-6248 </b>.\n<br>\nIt is possible to stay a few extra days at the same rate before and after the\nmeeting.\n<br>\nA number of condominiums (1 to 3 bedroom) will be available for those\npreferring apartment living.
