the School of Information and Computer Science University of California Irvine My advisor is Prof Cristina Lopes Department of Informatics University of California Irvine I was awarded Master of Science in Information and Computer Science at University of California Irvine in 2 12 My disseration topic was Enhancing Component Identification Using Machine Learning I was fortunate to have Prof Cristina Lopes Prof Andre van der Hoek Prof James Jones Prof Nenad Medvidovic and Prof Alexander Ihler in my dissertation committee Before joining University of California Irvine I worked at Tata Research Development and Design Centre India I have had the privilege of doing internships from industrial research labs to product groups to startups I spent my summer 11 at SRCH2 a startup specialized in improving user experiences in the domain of search summer 12 in a product group Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft Silicon Valley summer 13 in Human Interactions in Programming and Empirical Software Engineering groups at Microsoft Research in Redmond Research Interests My primary research interest has been in the area of Software Engineering with an emphasis on Software Evolution I am interested in developing theoretical and practical techniques and tools for helping people to understand and modify software systems My research activities to achieve this goal so far span the spectrum from quantitative measures for software properties to analysis of software changes to code modularization to architecture recovery In order to ultimately overcome the essential difficulties it has been recognized that both the processes and products of software development should be formalized and automated I believe that AI ML techniques can play an important role in this effort since the field of software engineering turns out to be one such fertile domain where many software development and maintenance tasks could be formulated as learning problems and ML techniques could be used to obtain solutions Publications Submitted Pending Submissions 1 A Comparative Study of Bug Patterns in Java Cloned and Non cloned Code at SCAM 2 14 2 Using Big Sky for

Looking forward to it. <br> \nIt was a long trip to Europe in June. Attended ICSE in Zurich to present our MSR challenge paper. Headed to Passau, Germany to attend ICPC and present our paper on scaling clone detection and a doctoral symposium paper on architecture recovery.  Good feedback :)<br>  \nOur paper \"Application Architecture Discovery: Towards Domain-driven, Easily Extensible Code Structure\" was awarded as the outstanding paper award at TCS's CTB (Corporate Technology Board) meeting.  It's good to win corporate awards too :) <br>\nI attended India Software Engineering Conference, 2012, Kanpur from Feb 20-25 and presented our work on \"Easing Software Evolution: A Change-data and Domain-driven Approach\"<br>\nI visited Williamsburg, VA for <a href=\"http://www.cs.wm.edu/icsm2011/\">ICSM 2011</a> where we had a paper in the research track on Clones in open source java systems <br>\nI am planning to go to Limerick, Ireland to attend <a href=\"http://www.cs.wm.edu/semeru/wcre2011/\">WCRE 2011</a> where we have a paper in the industrial track <br>\nI will be attending <a href=\"http://splashcon.org/2011/\">Splash 2011</a> in Portland, Oregon from October 23 - October 29 as a student volunteer!<br>\nCheck out <a href=\"http://www.omniplaces.com/\">Omniplaces</a>, a location based, instant, fuzzy search engine.
