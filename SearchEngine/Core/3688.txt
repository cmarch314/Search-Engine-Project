By a hexahedron we mean any\nconvex polyhedron in R^3 combinatorially equivalent to a cube; that\nis, a polyhedron with six quadrilateral faces meeting three at each\ncorner.  Assume that three of the four body diagonals meet at a common\npoint.  Prove that all four of the body diagonals meet at a common\npoint.\n\nThis has applications to how many projective toric varieties can have\na (combinatorial equivalent of the) octahedron as their image under\nthe moment map.\n</PRE>\n", "id": 3688.0}
