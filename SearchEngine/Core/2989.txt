If you are unsure what a Matlab function does, check the reference manual (at the command line, type \"help\" and then the command name).\n    <ol>\n      <p><li> Read over the provided the Matlab <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dramanan/teaching/cs216_fall09/MatlabTutorialCode.html\">tutorial</a>.\n\t<p> Open an interactive session in Matlab and test the commands by typing them at the\nprompt. (Skip this step if you are already familiar with Matlab.)\n\t<p><li> Describe (in words where appropriate) the result of each of the following Matlab commands. Use the help command as needed, but try to determine the output without entering the commands into Matlab.
