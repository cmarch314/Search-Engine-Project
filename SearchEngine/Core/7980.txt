Lessig categorizes regulatory forces into norms, law, market and code. He believes that these four \n        \tmeans can work together to reach an optimal mix in terms of regulatory efficiency.Yet nowadays new, hybrid regulatory regimes emerge, \n        \twhich do not belong to any single Lessigian category. For example, the Tribunal in League of Legends involves the comminity in policing \n        \titself, eBay court leverages crowdsourcing to resolute online dispute.How do these new regimes impact people's social life?<span id=\"more-7\"></span></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"page-title\">Spatial Gesture for Public Large Displays</h2>\n        <p> Motion sensing devices such as Leapmotion and Kinect allow people to control large interactive displays at a distance.How do people interact with them?
