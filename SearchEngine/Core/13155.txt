Graph\nAlgorithms and Applications</i> 16(2):543-567, 2012</a>.\n<p>\nWe define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph\nhas h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the\nh-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,\nmay be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,\nwe show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in\ntime O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte\nCaro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for\nsimulation of social networks. We also prove\nbounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior\nof the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/subgraphs.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>On the approximability of geometric and geographic generalization\nand the min-max bin covering problem</b>.<br>\nW.

An input to this problem consists\nof a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must\nbe grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at\nleast the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/anonymity.ppt\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Orientation-constrained rectangular layouts</b>.<br>\nD.

For an arbitrary\ndual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of\norientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a\nrectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The\nalgorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a\ngiven dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's\nrepresentation theorem for distributive lattices.\n<p>\nMerged with \"<a href=\"p-area-universal.html\">Area-universal rectangular layouts</a>\"\nto form the journal version, \"<a href=\"p-aucrl.html\">Area-universal and constrained rectangular layouts</a>\".\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/cartograms.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Optimal embedding into star metrics</b>.<br>\nD.

The main idea is to\nreduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.\nSpecifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle\ndetection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear\nfunctions of a parameter &lambda;, find the minimum value of &lambda;\nfor which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly\npolynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star\nmetric embedding problem.\n<p>\n(<a href=\"WADS09-talks/stars.pdf\">talk slides</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Adjacency-preserving spatial treemaps</b>.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.win.tue.nl/~kbuchin/\">K.
