(1959) published a report in which they showed that\n&lt;&gt; the expected minimum distance of a Traveling Salesman Problem solution\n&lt;&gt; is approximately 0.749 sqrt(N), where N points are randomly distributed\n&lt;&gt; in the unit square.\n&lt;\n&lt;They arrived at this via Monte Carlo simulation, and I don't think\n&lt;that it's correct to even two decimal places.  I've seen two other\n&lt;numbers for this constant quoted and all three disagree.  Does anyone\n&lt;know the *actual* value for this constant to 3 or more decimal places?\n&lt;\n&lt;&gt; I would like to know whether a similar expected MAXIMUM distance can be\n&lt;&gt; computed?  Also, is the distribution of TSP solutions for an N city problem\n&lt;&gt; known?\n&lt;\n&lt;Is this where the salesman is paid by the hour?  I don't know the\n&lt;answer, but my guess would be that it's approximately c*N^2, for some\n&lt;constant c.\n\n   As long as we are guessing, I'll predict that the correct value of the \nconstant .749... can be found in the Calcutta Mathematical Journal (c 1938) \nin a paper titled something like--\"On the average height of jute crop in the \nmonth of September.\" I think Beardwood et al were aware of this paper (in fact \nit may even be a reference in their paper). It's been a long time since I read\nit. Or maybe the reference can be found in Karp's paper on the Euclidean \nTraveling Salesman. I seem to remember that the C * sqrt (N) expected minimum\ndistance follows from results in the CMJ.\n\n-- Vijay\n</PRE>\n", "id": 3570.0}
