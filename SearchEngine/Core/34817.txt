The question is just how innate is a version specifier in a\nname at all?  To me (a version zealout), plenty.  The meta resource\ninformation to which Dan refers to has to do with describing the _content_\nof the resource, whereas the version information names the _container_\nof the content.\n\nBack to the nits...\n\nI question the use of the syntax \";version={version_identifier}\".  If\nthe word \"version\" is a stand-in for any number of meta identifiers,\nthen we dilute the strength of the argument that version information is\nintrinsic to a URL, and we are in fact back Dan's argument that such\ninformation belongs elsewhere.  On the other hand, if \"version=\" is a\nconstant string, let's strip it.\n\nAs for whether it's \";{version_identifier}\" or \",{version_identifier}\" --\nI like the comma better, but only because I'm a UNIX weenie (\";\" is\nspecial).\n\nWe need to stick to our guns: make a simple version extention to URLs\nand make them standard.\n\nChristopher\n----\nChristopher Seiwald     P3 Software             <a href=\"http://www.p3.com\">http://www.p3.com</a>\n<a href=\"mailto:seiwald@p3.com\">seiwald@p3.com</a>          f-f-f-fast SCM          1-510-865-8720\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0007.html\">Robert C.
