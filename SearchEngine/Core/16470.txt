It is one of the key aspects of A M PW Software Engineering Process Group s software process instantiation The SPN allows for virtual co location promotes process and product visibility is a good mechanism for process coordination and communication and provides dynamic on line training The SPN supports on line audits and was an enabling factor in Boeing North American Aircraft s achievement of the Software Engineering Institute SEI Capability Maturity Model s highest software process maturity level Level 5 It contributed to the significant culture change necessary in higher SEI rated organizations by providing access to metric and process based information throughout the organization minimizing information hiding This presentation will describe an overview of the SPN followed by an on line demonstration Biographies Ms Abelson has spent 15 years in the aerospace industry for the past six years Ms Abelson has been involved in software process improvement Ms Abelson developed

Software Process Improvement Inititative Northrop Grumman Corporation purcele mail northgrum com When the Military Aircraft Systems Division MASD of Northrop Grumman Corporation embarked on its Level 4 journey early in 1996 a considerable amount of time and energy was spent developing a clear understanding of what Level 4 meant to an organization like MASD a defense contractor building medium to large systems A number of questions needed to be answered among them How can quantitative software quality and process performance goals be derived from non quantitative organization and customer goals What is an effective way of developing a project s Level 4 overall approach How much statistical process control knowledge did the software community need to be effective with the Level 4 practices This presentation describes what was done and what was learned as MASD achieved Level 4 for two flagship projects in December 1997 and Level 4 for the division in October 1998 A cornerstone of the approach is the mapping of selected quality attributes to specific quality metrics baselining those quality metrics and then setting quality goals Along the way process performance is measured and baselined setting the stage for improved process capability Biography Leitha has over 2 years of systems engineering and software engineering experience She has been involved in process
