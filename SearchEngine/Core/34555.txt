From your URL, it appears\nthat \"VERSION\" appears as a constant string, immediately followed by the\nversion number in the next hierarchy down.  Is this correct?\n\nIf so, I'm not terribly fond of this approach.  To date we have been mostly\ndealing with how to handle labeling of the version of leaf nodes in a\nheirarchy.  However, the general case for configuration management is that\nthere is a heirarchy of versioned collections of versioned resources.\nIdeally, what is needed to handle this is a naming mechanism like:\n\n<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/top;version=rev_2.0/middle;version=14.2/leaf;version=5.5\">http://foo.bar.com/top;version=rev_2.0/middle;version=14.2/leaf;version=5.5</a>\n\nUnfortunately, the URL specification at present does not allow parameters\nto be included in each level of the heirarchy.\n\nThis could be translated into a heirarchical namespace as follows:\n\n<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/VERSION/rev_2.0/top/VERSION/14.2/middle/VERSION/5.5/leaf\">http://foo.bar.com/VERSION/rev_2.0/top/VERSION/14.2/middle/VERSION/5.5/leaf</a>\n\nHowever, in my last post I showed the problems inherent in this approach\n(i.e., the assumption that everything leaf referrs to using relative URLs\nmust also be version 5.5).  Also, in this approach, \"5.5\" is clearly not a\ncollection, but is the version of the leaf resource.\n\nThe alternative is to reverse your initial proposal:\n\n<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/top/VERSION/rev_2.0/middle/VERSION/14.2/leaf/VERSION/5.5\">http://foo.bar.com/top/VERSION/rev_2.0/middle/VERSION/14.2/leaf/VERSION/5.5</a>\n\nThis might actually work, although I find it to be much less elegant, and\nmore susceptable to namespace collisions than using the \";version=\" format.\n\n- Jim\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0089.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0087.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0083.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0089.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "id": 34555.0}
