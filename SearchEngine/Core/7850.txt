System Table of Contents What Is AsterixDB Getting and Using AsterixDB What Is AsterixDB Back to TOC In a nutshell AsterixDB is a full function BDMS Big Data Management System with a rich feature set that distinguishes it from pretty much any other Big Data platform that s out and available today We believe that its feature set makes it well suited to modern needs such as web data warehousing and social data storage and analysis AsterixDB has A semistructured NoSQL style data model ADM resulting from extending JSON with object database ideasAn expressive and declarative query language AQL that supports a broad range of queries and analysis over semistructured dataA parallel runtime query execution engine Hyracks that has been scale tested on up to 1 cores and 5 disksPartitioned LSM based data storage and indexing to support efficient ingestion and management of semistructured dataSupport for query access to externally stored data e g data in HDFS as well as to data stored natively by AsterixDBA rich set of primitive data types including spatial and temporal data in addition to integer floating point and textual dataSecondary indexing options that include B trees R trees and inverted keyword exact and fuzzy index typesSupport for fuzzy and spatial queries as well as for more traditional parametric queriesBasic transactional concurrency and recovery capabilities akin to those of a NoSQL store Getting and Using AsterixDB Back to TOC You are most likely here because you are interested in getting your hands on AsterixDB so you would like to know how to get it how to set it up and how to use it The following is a list of the supporting documents that we have available today Installing AsterixDB using Managix This is our installation guide and it is where you should start This document will tell you how to obtain install and manage instances of AsterixDB including both single machine setup for developers as well as cluster installations for deployment in its intended form AsterixDB 1 1 An ADM and AQL Primer This is a first timers introduction to the user model of the AsterixDB BDMS by which we mean the view of AsterixDB as seen from the perspective of an average user or Big Data application developer The AsterixDB user model consists of its data modeling features ADM and its query capabilities AQL This document presents a tiny social data warehousing example and uses it as a backdrop for describing by example the key features of AsterixDB By working through this document you will learn how to define the artifacts needed to manage data in AsterixDB how to load data into the system how to use most of the basic features of its query language and how to insert and delete data dynamically Asterix Data Model ADM Asterix Functions Asterix functions for Allen s Relations and Asterix Query Language AQL These are reference documents that catalog the primitive data types and built in functions available in AQL and the reference manual for AQL itself REST API to AsterixDB Access to data in an AsterixDB instance is provided via a REST based API This is a short document that describes the REST API entry points and their URL syntax To all who have now come this far Thanks for your interest in AsterixDB and for kicking its tires in its Beta form In addition to getting the system and trying it out please sign up as a member of the AsterixDB user mailing list asterixdb users at googlegroups com so that you can contact us easily with your questions issues and other feedback We want AsterixDB to be a big hit some day and we are anxious to see what users do with it and to learn from that feedback what we should be working on most urgently in the next phase of the project Copyright 2 14 All Rights Reserved ", "_id":
