{"text": "Twenty Proofs of Euler s Formula V E F 2 Many theorems in mathematics are important enough that they have been proved repeatedly in surprisingly many different ways Examples of this include the existence of infinitely many prime numbers the evaluation of zeta 2 the fundamental theorem of algebra polynomials have roots quadratic reciprocity a formula for testing whether an arithmetic progression contains a square and the Pythagorean theorem which according to Wells has at least 367 proofs This also sometimes happens for unimportant theorems such as the fact that in any rectangle dissected into smaller rectangles if each smaller rectangle has integer width or height so does the large one This page lists proofs of the Euler formula for any convex polyhedron the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two more than the number of edges Symbolically V E F 2 For instance a tetrahedron has four vertices four faces and six edges 4 6 4 2 A version of the formula dates over 1 years earlier than Euler to Descartes in 163 Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss Bonnet theorem stating that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron is 2 V 2 from which he infers that the number of plane angles is 2F 2V 4 The number of plane angles is always twice the number of edges so this is equivalent to Euler s formula but later authors such as Lakatos Malkevitch and Polya disagree feeling that the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to be viewed as the same formula The formula V E F 2 was re discovered by Euler he wrote about it twice in 175 and in 1752 published the result with a faulty proof by induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and retriangulating the hole formed by its removal The retriangulation step does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the resulting shape so the induction does not go through Another early attempt at a proof by Meister in 1784 is essentially the triangle removal proof given here but without justifying the existence of a triangle to remove In 1794 Legendre provided a complete proof using spherical angles Cauchy got into the act in 1811 citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle removal ear decomposition and tetrahedron removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into smaller polyhedra Hilton and Pederson provide more references as well as entertaining speculation on Euler s discovery of the formula Confusingly other equations such as ei pi 1 and aphi n 1 mod n also go by the name of Euler s formula Euler was a busy man The polyhedron formula of course can be generalized in many important ways some using methods described below One important generalization is to planar graphs To form a planar graph from a polyhedron place a light source near one face of the polyhedron and a plane on the other side The shadows of the polyhedron edges form a planar graph embedded in such a way that the edges are straight line segments The faces of the polyhedron correspond to convex polygons that are faces of the embedding The face nearest the light source corresponds to the outside face of the embedding which is also convex Conversely any planar graph with certain connectivity properties comes from a polyhedron in this way Some of the proofs below use only the topology of the planar graph some use the geometry of its embedding and some use the three dimensional geometry of the original polyhedron Graphs in these proofs will not necessarily be simple edges may connect a vertex to itself and two vertices may be connected by multiple edges Several of the proofs rely on the Jordan curve theorem which itself has multiple proofs however these are not generally based on Euler s formula so one can use Jordan curves without fear of circular reasoning Proof 1 Interdigitating Trees Proof 2 Induction on Faces Proof 3 Induction on Vertices Proof 4 Induction on Edges Proof 5 Divide and Conquer Proof 6 Electrical Charge Proof 7 Dual Electrical Charge Proof 8 Sum of Angles Proof 9 Spherical Angles Proof 1 Pick s Theorem Proof 11 Ear Decomposition Proof 12 Shelling Proof 13 Triangle Removal Proof 14 Noah s Ark Proof 15 Binary Homology Proof 16 Binary Space Partition Proof 17 Valuations Proof 18 Hyperplane Arrangements Proof 19 Integer Point Enumeration Proof 2 Euler tours All Proofs References Please send email if you know of a proof not listed here I would especially appreciate proofs involving cohomology theory toric varieties or other higher mathematics Helena Verrill has shown that Euler s formula is equivalent to the fact that every toric variety over GF p has a number of points equal to 1 mod p but is still missing a nice non combinatorial proof of the latter fact I imagine it would be possible to construct inductions based on the representation of convex polyhedra as intersections of halfspaces or convex hulls of points but the need to handle inputs in non general position would make the resulting proofs quite messy There also seems to be a potential connection to binomials if one defines a polynomial p t 1 Vt Et2 Ft3 t4 the Euler formula can be interpreted as saying that p t is divisible by 1 t But for simplices of any dimension p t 1 t d 1 by the binomial formula Perhaps there is a proof of Euler s formula that uses these polynomials directly rather than merely translating one of the inductions into polynomial form Jim Propp asks similar questions for infinite dimensional polytopes interpreting p t as a
