We employ a large database of manually segmented\nimages in order to learn an optimal affinity function between pairs of pixels.\nThese pairwise affinities can then be used to cluster the pixels into visually\ncoherent groups. Region cues are computed as the similarity in brightness,\ncolor, and texture between image patches. Boundary cues are incorporated by\nlooking for the presence of an \"intervening contour\", a large gradient along a\nstraight line connecting two pixels.\n\nWe first use the dataset of human segmentations to individually optimize\nparameters of the patch and gradient features for brightness, color, and\ntexture cues. We then quantitatively measure the power of different feature\ncombinations by computing the precision and recall of classifiers trained\nusing those features. The mutual information between the output of the\nclassifiers and the same-segment indicator function provides an alternative\nevaluation technique that yields identical conclusions.\n\nAs expected, the best classifier makes use of brightness, color, and\ntexture features, in both patch and gradient forms. We find that for\nbrightness, the gradient cue outperforms the patch similarity. In\ncontrast, using color patch similarity yields better results than using\ncolor gradients. Texture is the most powerful of the three channels,\nwith both patches and gradients carrying significant independent\ninformation. Interestingly, the proximity of the two pixels does not\nadd any information beyond that provided by the similarity cues. We\nalso find that the convexity assumptions made by the intervening\ncontour approach are supported by the ecological statistics of the\ndataset.\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/FowlkesMM_CVPR_2003/FowlkesMM_CVPR_2003.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nCharless Fowlkes, David Martin, and Jitendra Malik.\nLearning affinity functions for image segmentation: combining patch-based and gradient-based approaches.\nIn <em>CVPR</em>, II: 54&ndash;61. 2003.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@inproceedings{<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FowlkesMM_CVPR_2003,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Fowlkes, Charless and Martin, David and Malik, Jitendra\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"Learning Affinity Functions for Image Segmentation: Combining Patch-Based and Gradient-Based Approaches\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2003\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"CVPR\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pages = \"II: 54-61\"<br>\n}<br>\n<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2015 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 4985.0}
