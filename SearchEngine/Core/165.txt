What can help eliminate the where-to-eat dilemma? How can patients easily connect with their physicians during times of natural disaster? Winners of the latest Butterworth Product Development Competition aim to address these challenges, while fellow finalists focused on tackling such topics as online language learning and the college application process.\n</p>\n<p>\nDesigned to promote the creation of commercially viable technology and products while fostering entrepreneurship among students, the Butterworth Competition is named for Bren School alumnus Paul Butterworth (B.S. &#8217;74, M.S. &#8217;81), chief technical officer of AccessG2 Inc.   \n</p>\n<p>\nThis year&#8217;s grand prize winning team took home $5,000 for Bluetooth Assisted Tracking, or BAT, which monitors the travel patterns of people in a given space. Second place and $3,500 went to the creators of TasteBuds, a mobile application that provides personalized restaurant recommendations. Developers of Life Buoy, winner of the 2012 \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/spotlight/spotlight_medappjam_2012\">Med AppJam</a>, \ncame in third and received $1,500 for their iOS and web application that wirelessly connects patients to physicians.\n</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"section\">\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<h3>MORE ABOUT THE 2013 WINNERS:</h3>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>\n<b>&#8220;BLUETOOTH ASSISTED TRACKING (BAT)&#8221; <br/>\n1st Place &#8212; $5,000 </b>\n</p>\n<!-- -->\n<img alt=\"BAT\" class=\"wrapped_image right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/spotlight/butterworth_2013/BAT.jpg\"/>\nBluetooth Assisted Tracking (BAT) monitors the travel patterns &#8212; including origin, destination, travel time, dwell times and travel paths for a given period of time &#8212; of people indoors and outdoors. In museums and art galleries, knowledge of visitor travel patterns is crucial in assessing the impact of temporary and permanent exhibits, and in determining staff management and allocation of resources. BAT provides an integrated experience across museums while leveraging the indoor tracking capabilities that Bluetooth technology offers. This solution comes at a considerably lower cost than current available technologies such as Wi-Fi triangulation.\n<p>\n<b>Team BAT:</b> Jaime Enrique Duarte, Joan Aguilar Mayans, Robert Regue Grino, Ana Papio Toda, Estel Carb&#243; Vinaixa, Yue Yu\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Mentors:</b> Arie Shen (BS &#8217;88, Bren School of ICS), Vice President, Business Development, Independent Consultant, and Jim Doane, Vice President, Marketing, Independent Consultant\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>\n<b>&#8220;TASTEBUDS&#8221; <br/>\n2nd Place &#8212; $3,500 </b>\n</p>\n<img alt=\"TasteBuds\" class=\"wrapped_image right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/spotlight/butterworth_2013/TasteBuds.jpg\"/>\nTasteBuds is a free mobile application that eliminates the &#8220;where to eat&#8221; dilemma by providing personalized restaurant recommendations based on the time of day and the user&#8217;s mood or activity. It focuses on providing a dynamic user experience with engaging gaming elements that allow users to discover foods and restaurants based on their personal preferences. It also offers food suggestions for various activities, including a post-workout brunch, date night dinner, or a late-night snack.

It provides a fast and reliable means for patients to connect with their physicians and health care team; lowers the costs of health care administration by lowering utilization of expensive and unnecessary health services; and improves patient health and well-being by preventing acute health-related events before they start. Life Buoy enables video consultations with physicians over any geographical distance; real-time updates to secure patient-centered personal health records; and instantaneous e-prescription of medicines to nearby pharmacies. In times of natural or man-made disaster, Life Buoy is capable of doubling as an emergency relief aid, providing up-to-date GPS locations of relief centers and emergency rooms. Patients use the iPhone or Web app to store their own data and to connect with physicians, and physicians use the iPad version to handle messages and patient data.\n<p><b>Team Life Buoy:</b> Matthew Chan, Jacob Heller, Bryan Lam, Lita Patel, Peggy Bui, Joe Hanson\n</p>\n<p><b>Mentor:</b>  David Cheng (BS &#8217;90, Bren School of ICS), IBM\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n</p>\n</div>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n</div>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"section\">\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<h3>ABOUT THE 2013 FINALISTS:</h3>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><b>&#8220;DORBL&#8221;</b></p>\n<img alt=\"Dorbl\" class=\"wrapped_image right\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/spotlight/butterworth_2013/Dorbl.jpg\"/>\nDorbl is an online marketplace focusing on locality.
