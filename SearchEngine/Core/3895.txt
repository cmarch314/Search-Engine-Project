Demaine, John Iacono, Stefan Langerman\n\n<p>\nAbstract: \nWe introduce a new data structuring paradigm in which operations can\nbe performed on a data structure not only in the present, but also in\nthe past. In this new paradigm, called retroactive data structures,\nthe historical sequence of operations performed on the data structure\nis not fixed. The data structure allows arbitrary insertion and\ndeletion of operations at arbitrary times, subject only to\nconsistency\nrequirements. We initiate the study of retroactive data structures by\nformally defining the model and its variants. We prove that, unlike\npersistence, efficient retroactivity is not always achievable. Thus,\nwe present efficient retroactive data structures for queues, doubly\nended queues, priority queues, union-find, and decomposable search\nstructures.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 3895.0}
