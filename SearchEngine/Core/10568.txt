{"text": "Eclipse Download and Installation for Python Instructions Install Python and Java before installing Eclipse You may want to print these instructions before proceeding so that you can refer to them while downloading and installing Eclipse Or just keep this document in your browser You should read each step completely before performing the action that it describes This document shows downloading and installing Eclipse on Windows 7 in Fall 2 14 Eclipse Version 4 4 Luna The Eclipse download requires about 2 MB of disk space keep it on your machine in case you need to re install Eclipse When installed Eclipse requires an additional 2 MB of disk space Downloading Click Eclipse The following page will appear in your browser In this handout we will download Eclipse Standard 4 4 for Windows 32 Bit if your computer uses Windows continue below otherwise look for the pull down list showing Windows and instead choose either Mac OS X Cocoa or Linux and then continue below It is critical that Java Python and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are all 64 Bit and only if your Machine OS supports 64 Bit I think it easiest to use 32 Bit for everything Click the Windows 32 Bit Operating System for your machine under the heading Eclipse Standard 4 4 right under Package Solutions You will see the following page don t worry about the name of the institution to the right of the
