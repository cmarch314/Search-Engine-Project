Given a set $P$ of $n$ points drawn from an $n\\times n$ grid\nand an error parameter $\\eps$, the goal is to build a data structure, such\nthat for any orthogonal range $R$, the data structure can return the number\nof points in $P\\cap R$ with additive error $\\eps n$. A well-known solution\nfor this problem is the {\\em $\\eps$-approximation}. Informally speaking, an\n$\\eps$-approximation of $P$ is a subset $A\\subseteq P$ that allows us to\nestimate the number of points in $P\\cap R$ by counting the number of points\nin $A\\cap R$. It is known that an $\\eps$-approximation of size\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\eps} \\log^{2.5} \\frac{1}{\\eps})$ exists for any $P$ with\nrespect to orthogonal ranges, and the best lower bound is\n$\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\eps} \\log \\frac{1}{\\eps})$.\nThe $\\eps$-approximation is a rather restricted data structure, as we are\nnot allowed to store any information other than the coordinates of a subset\nof points in $P$. In this paper, we explore what can be achieved without any\nrestriction on the data structure. We first describe a data structure that\nuses $O(\\frac{1}{\\eps} \\log \\frac{1} {\\eps} \\log\\log \\frac{1}{\\eps} \\log n)$\nbits that answers queries with error $\\eps n$. We then prove a lower bound\nthat any data structure that answers queries with error $O(\\log n)$ must use\n$\\Omega(n\\log n)$ bits. This lower bound has two consequences: 1) answering\nqueries with error $O(\\log n)$ is as hard as answering the queries exactly;\nand 2) our upper bound cannot be improved in general by more than an $O(\\log\n\\log \\frac{1}{\\eps})$ factor.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "id": 3389.0}
