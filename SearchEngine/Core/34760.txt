EDIT cookies Previous message Yaron Goland RE Initial Dist Auth Requirements Hi folks I have been lurking on this list for while I think that I follow Christopher s reasoning here and I would like to paraphrase here just to make sure I have it right When a user checks out a document for editing the revision contrl system should record who it is that is checking out the document so that when the same user attempts to check in the document there is a mechanism to say Hey remember me I am checking in the document that I previously checked out for editing Here it is The RCS can verify that it is the same user that is recorded and proceed or reject the action if it is not the same user Christopher is asserting that a cookie is the best if not the only way to manage the session Is that about it Murray At 1 PM 28 8 96 7 Christopher Seiwald wrote I ll try to explain the notion behind GET for EDIT cookies a little since both Jim and David s responses showed that my initial explanation left a bit to be desired Me 1 A fundamental component of GET for EDIT has to be a cookie that represents any stored context in the document server that needs to be reunited with the document on checkin Most if not all SCM systems are aware of their users activity and use this awareness to keep users from stomping on each other s work Jim I think that use of cookies might be necessary in an implementation However I suspect that you can maybe do it all with only MD5 authentication i e only knowing the user David I m not sure of the role for the cookie in this just call me dense later on in this mail I guess why you might use one But the reservation and context establishment should be handled by LOCK If a server requires special reservation for editing it s the client s responsibility to obtain a lock on the file before doing a PUT If the client already has a cached copy a conditional GET based on the version at the server might be useful I think decoupling the access control aspects LOCKing and so forth from the GET PUT operations gives us a lot more generality extremely easily I don t see any situation where get for edit is really different from LOCK resource for writing followed by GET If the client has a local copy the GET could even be conditional on the version they have being a leaf though this would not be a requirement Then we might even be able to PUT a few times before releasing the lock Attempts to PUT without a needed lock could bounce on servers that need or want to enforce such a discipline on their clients Me again Locking reservations can be handled by LOCK I quite agree But SCM systems don t hang all their context on a lock they hang it on the checkout That s when the user tells the system I ll be changing this here document and the system records that fact for the day when the user says Uh here s that document I changed The SCM system uses this context to keep track of the dozens thousands of users out there all trying to change the same set of documents but invariable all starting with different revisions of those documents Not all SCM systems require a lock before checking in documents and some acquire that lock automatically so many PUTs are likely to happen in the absense of a LOCK But all SCM systems except CVS require some sort of checkout locking or non locking before checkin Now you could fudge it and by remembering the URL and revision do a paired checkout checkin to establish the required context But this defeats a feature that all modern SCM systems boast tracking user activity They have this feature because users don t remember what they re doing and they certainly don t remember what other people are doing Half the job of SCM systems and by extension version aware web servers is to keep track of who is doing what to what just to remind everyone involved Those scenarios I cooked up where Joe and Jane keep stepping on each other weren t just from my past experience they were from my past week s experience Only one user can LOCK a file If the context is established on LOCK then there will be only one context per document precluding Joe and Jane from finding out that they re doctoring the same text Normally SCM systems have a tight association between the checkout context and the checked out file because often there is no way to work outside of the SCM system But if the SCM system is the backend of a version aware web server with the actual work happening in stateless web clients then that context must be represented by a cookie The cookie belongs to the underlying SCM system whether it is an MD5 hash of the document contents some cryptic string churned up from bowels of the SCM database or allworkandnoplaymakesjohnnyadullboy is not HTTP s or a Web authoring tool s business They just have to keep it associated with the checked out document so that it can be reunited with the checkout context at checkin time This cookie is the single most important component of distributed web authoring

But\n&gt;SCM systems don't hang all their context on a lock: they hang it on the\n&gt;\"checkout\".  That's when the user tells the system, \"I'll be changing\n&gt;this here document,\" and the system records that fact for the day when\n&gt;the user says, \"Uh, here's that document I changed.\" The SCM system uses\n&gt;this context to keep track of the dozens (thousands?) of users out there,\n&gt;all trying to change the same set of documents (but invariable all\n&gt;starting with different revisions of those documents).  \n&gt;\n&gt;Not all SCM systems require a lock before checking in documents, and\n&gt;some acquire that lock automatically, so many PUTs are likely to happen\n&gt;in the absense of a LOCK.  But _all_ SCM systems (except CVS) require\n&gt;some sort of checkout (locking or non-locking) before checkin.  Now you\n&gt;could fudge it, and by remembering the URL and revision do a paired\n&gt;checkout/checkin to establish the required context.  But this defeats\n&gt;a feature that all modern SCM systems boast: tracking user activity.\n&gt;They have this feature because users don't remember what they're doing,\n&gt;and they certainly don't remember what other people are doing.
