A more useful distinction is between \ntechniques that sample the space of possible executions, and techniques \nthat fold the space. The new distinction provides better insight into the \nways different techniques can interact, and is a basis for considering \nhybrid fault detection techniques including combinations of testing and \nformal verification. \n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 27 13:36:13 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "id": 25930.0}
