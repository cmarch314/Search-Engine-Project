In this paper, we introduce a family of variance reduction schemes that generalize the sample mean from the conventional OR search space to the AND/OR search space for graphical models. The new sample means allow trading time and space with variance. At one end is the AND/OR sample tree mean which has the same time and space complexity as the conventional OR sample tree mean but has smaller variance. At the other end is the AND/OR sample graph mean which requires more time and space to compute but has the smallest variance. Theoretically, we show that the variance is smaller in the AND/OR space because the AND/OR sample mean is defined over a larger virtual sample size compared with the OR sample mean. Empirically, we demonstrate that the AND/OR sample mean is far closer to the true mean than the OR sample mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/publications/r172.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" --><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "id": 8586.0}
