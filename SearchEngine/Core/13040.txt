{"text": "HW3 Due 5 9 11 am EEE Dropbox Template based detection In this assignment you will implement a face tracker You will use the face images from the project video set You will explore different strategies for template updating the effect of searching over scale and the choice of template scoring functions Overview You will be given skeleton code here The high level script hw3 m is a wrapper for implementing a basic template tracker You will need to fill in the referenced functions in order to have the code execute correctly The questions below involve significant additions to the basic wrapper User interaction The wrapper script requires a user to draw a rectangle in the first frame using matlab s getrect function I have included a rectangle saved as a matlab matfile For reference a rectangle will be encoded as a 4 element array x1 y1 x2 y2 capturing the topleft and bottom right corner There are three sections to this assignment Helper functions showBox m 1 pts This function will display a image and draw a rectangle at the fiven coordinates I suggest using imshow and line matlab functions cropIm m 1 pts This function takes an image and a rectangle with an optional pad region and crops out the rectangular portion of the image Basic tracker SSDIm m 2 pts This function computes the SSD sum of squared difference score of a template and and image at all possible locations NCCIm m 2 pts This function computes the NCC normalized cross correlation score of a template and and image at all possible locations maxResp m 2 pts This function returns the rectangle with the maximum response given an array of response values What to hand in Hand in all the completed functions above complete with comments Also hand in figures illustrating the behaviour of various extensions of the basic tracker as specified below For a given strategy show three illustrative frames one frame of sucessful tracking the frame where the tracker starts to fail and one frame where the tracker has completely lost track To save space use subplot m to display these three frames in a single row Also specify the frame at which the tracker lost track this time to failure statistic is a common way to evaluate trackers Note that the following extensions are not trivial and require significantly more work beyond implementing the basic tracker above Q1 Implement the basic tracker which requires no modification to the wrapper beyond pointing to your directory of images For both SSDIm m and NCCIm m you will be required to use use matlab s conv2 A B to compute this I suggest using the conv2 A B interface rather than the conv2 H1 H2 B interface as the latter is buggy Note that you can still implement a separable filter with the former simply by calling it twice with two one dimensional arrays Show results for both SSD NCC At what frames do the trackers begin to loose track Use the time to failure to specify which scoring function is better 1 pts Q2 The tracker will be slow as the template as quite big Modify the wrapper to use smaller images and templates using matlab s imresize with bilinear interpolation What is the minimum size for which you still achieve good tracking results What is the time to failure of both algorithms Use either the SSD or NCC scoring criteria whichever works better Again show three frames and specify the time to failure 1 pts code 1 pts writeup to question Q3 Multi scale tracking Use either the SSD or NCC scoring criteria whichever works better Because the face changes scale during the sequence implement tracker that searches over scale changes by resizing the image and or the template This will require you to write a multiScaleSSDIm m or equiv NCC and a multiScaleMaxResp m Again show three frames and specify the time to failure 2 pts code 1 pts writeup to question Q4 In this question you will examine template update strategies The default wrapper does not update the template Use either the SSD or NCC scoring criteria whichever works better Implement a tracker that uses the estimated patch from the previous frame as the template Show three frames and specify the time to failure 1 pts code 1 pts writeup Implement a tracker that computes an average of running average of previous patches Show three frames and specify the time to failure 1 pts code 1 pts writeup Implement a tracker that computes a weighted average of previous patches using the update formula Template new Template old 1 Patch new Try different values of including and 1 What value of yeilds the best result Show three frames and specify the time to failure 1 pts code 1 pts writeup Q5 Edge based tracking Fix an update strategy and multi scale strategy that performs the best so far You will now explore a new scoring function based on edge based templates Rather than matching pixel intensities you will match binary edge images Implement a new function computeEdges m that takes as input a grayscale image and returns a binary edge image of the same size You may implement your own gradient based edge detector or use matlab s edge I canny thresh sigma function If you use matlab s edge detector experiment with different thresholds and sigmas Try both SSD and NCC scoring using binary edge features Show three frames and specify the time to failure 2 pts code 1 pts writeup Q6 EXTRA CREDIT Implement a Chamfer score using binary edge templates You may use matlab s bwdist function to compute a distance transform and edge function to perform Canny edge detection Show three frames and specify the time to failure 1 pts Hints I suggest you initially work with half resized templates and images from Question 2 so as to speed up the overall tracking code All the functions can be implemented with a few lines of MATLAB code If you are writing lots of code there is probably a simpler solution though you will not be penalized for long code The writeup requires lots of plots Use subplot m to generate figures with multiple plots For an example of its usage see make plots m ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dramanan/teaching/cs117_spring13/hw/hw3/", "title": "hw3", "html": "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC

detection</h3>\n\n    In this assignment, you will implement a face tracker. You will use the \"face\" images from the project video set. You will explore different strategies for template updating, the effect of searching over scale, and the choice of template scoring functions.\n\n    <p> <b> Overview: </b>   You will be given skeleton code <a href=\"hw3_skel.zip\">here</a>. The high level script \"hw3.m\" is a wrapper for implementing a basic template tracker. You will need to fill in the referenced functions in order to have the code execute correctly. The questions below involve significant additions to the basic wrapper.\n\n    <p> <b> User interaction: </b> The wrapper script requires a user to draw a rectangle in the first frame using matlab's \"getrect\" function. I have included a rectangle saved as a matlab matfile. For reference, a rectangle will be encoded as a 4-element array [x1 y1 x2 y2] capturing the topleft and bottom right corner.\n\n      There are three sections to this assignment.\n\n    <h3> Helper functions </h3>\n\n   <ol>\n\t<p><li> showBox.m [10 pts]\n\t<p> This function will display a image and draw a rectangle at the fiven coordinates.

Also hand in figures illustrating the behaviour of various extensions of the basic tracker, as specified below. For a given strategy, show three illustrative frames -  one frame of sucessful tracking, the frame where the tracker starts to fail, and one frame where the tracker has completely lost track. To save space, use subplot.m to display these three frames in a single row. Also specify the frame at which the tracker lost track - this \"time-to-failure\" statistic is a common way to evaluate trackers. Note that the following extensions are not trivial, and require significantly more work beyond implementing the basic tracker above.\n\t<p><li> Q1. Implement the basic tracker, which requires no modification to the wrapper (beyond pointing to your directory of images). For both SSDIm.m and NCCIm.m, you will be required to use use matlab's \"conv2(A,B)\" to compute this. I suggest using the \"conv2(A,B)\" interface rather than the \"conv2(H1,H2,B)\" interface as the latter is buggy. Note that you can still implement a separable filter with the former simply by calling it twice with two one-dimensional arrays. Show results for both SSD + NCC. At what frames do the trackers begin to loose track? Use the time-to-failure to specify which scoring function is better. [10 pts]\n\t<p><li> Q2. The tracker will be slow, as the template as quite big. Modify the wrapper to use smaller images and templates using matlab's \"imresize\" with bilinear interpolation. What is the minimum size for which you still achieve good tracking results? What is the time-to-failure of both algorithms? Use either the SSD or NCC scoring criteria (whichever works better). Again show three frames, and specify the time-to-failure. [10 pts code + 10 pts writeup to question]\n\t<p><li> Q3. Multi-scale tracking. Use either the SSD or NCC scoring criteria (whichever works better). Because the face changes scale during the sequence, implement tracker that searches over scale changes by resizing the image and/or the template. This will require you to write a multiScaleSSDIm.m (or equiv. NCC) and a multiScaleMaxResp.m. Again show three frames, and specify the time-to-failure. [20 pts code + 10 pts writeup to question]\n        <p><li> Q4. In this question, you will examine template update strategies. The default wrapper does not update the template. Use either the SSD or NCC scoring criteria (whichever works better). \n               <ol>\n\t\t      <li> Implement a tracker that uses the estimated patch from the previous frame as the template. Show three frames and specify the time-to-failure. [10 pts code + 10 pts writeup]\n\t\t      <li> Implement a tracker that computes an average of running average of previous patches. Show three frames and specify the time-to-failure. [10 pts code + 10 pts writeup]\n\t\t      <li>Implement a tracker that computes a weighted average of previous patches using the update formula: Template_new = &alpha;*Template_old + (1-&alpha;)*Patch_new. Try different values of &alpha; including 0 and 1. What value of &alpha; yeilds the best result? Show three frames and specify the time-to-failure. [10 pts code + 10 pts writeup]\n\t\t</ol>\n <p><li> Q5. Edge-based tracking. Fix an update strategy and multi-scale strategy that performs the best so far. You will now explore a new scoring function based on edge-based templates. Rather than matching pixel intensities, you will match binary edge images. Implement a new function computeEdges.m that takes as input a grayscale image and returns a binary edge image of the same size. You may implement your own gradient-based edge detector or use matlab's \"edge(I,'canny',thresh,sigma)\" function. If you use matlab's edge detector, experiment with different thresholds and sigmas. Try both SSD and NCC scoring using binary edge features. Show three frames and specify the time-to-failure. [20 pts code + 10 pts writeup]\n <p><li> Q6. [EXTRA-CREDIT] Implement a Chamfer-score using binary edge-templates. You may use matlab's \"bwdist\" function to compute a distance transform and \"edge\" function to perform Canny edge detection. Show three frames and specify the time-to-failure.  [10 pts]\n\t\t\t\n    </ol>\n   <h3> Hints </h3>\n    <ul>\n\t    <p><li> I suggest you initially work with half-resized templates and images (from Question 2), so as to speed up the overall tracking code.\n\t    <p><li> All the functions can be implemented with a few lines of MATLAB code.
