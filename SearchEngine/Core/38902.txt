REV 125 15 July 2 71112Enormous number of bug fixes and additions Many thanks to ewjordan 13and fjen who also contributed fixes for this release 141516 api changes 1718 Changed the constructors for the Capture class to be more consistent 19 with the rest of the video library The following constructors 2 Capture PApplet parent int width int height 21 Capture PApplet parent int width int height int rate 22 Capture PApplet parent String name int width int height 23 Capture PApplet parent String name int width int height int rate 24 have been changed to 25 Capture PApplet parent int width int height 26 Capture PApplet parent int width int height int rate 27 Capture PApplet parent int width int height String name 28 Capture PApplet parent int width int height String name int rate 29 This version is not particularly consistent 3 Capture PApplet parent int width int height int rate 31 though we ll be leaving it in because it was used so heavily 3233 The split method has been altered to avoid inconsistency In fact 34 it has split itself into two methods Har har har 35 split String s has been removed use splitTokens String s instead 36 split String s char c remains unchanged 37 split String s String delim is now splitTokens String s String delim 38 The new model is that split breaks a String into pieces given a single39 delmiter which can be a single character or many characters For instance 4 split Something BR in BR BR HTML BR 41 now produces the array Something in HTML 42 The split method breaks the String whenever it sees the delimiter 43 so a BR next to another BR produces an empty String 44 On the other hand splitTokens takes a list of possible delimiters 45 and will consume one or more of any of them For instance 46 splitTokens really messed up with commas 47 will produce the array really messed up with commas 48 Because any group of comma or space characters and in any order 49 will simply be consumed as a single break 5 51 The casting functions e g int float boolean and friends52 have now been streamlined a bit to only cover casts that actually53 make sense 5455 Blending modes have been finalized for 1 thanks to the help56 of Dave Bollinger who contributed code to complete the set 57 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 132 58 See the reference for blend for more details Thanks Dave 596 The constant CENTER RADIUS is now simply RADIUS Both still work 61 but CENTER RADIUS should be avoided 6263 The constants for ENTER TAB et al are now char values 64 rather than ints 6566 The framerate method in the movie library has been renamed to 67 frameRate 6869 Addition from Tom Hulbert to add setDTR to the Serial library 7 71 Where possible more methods inside PApplet have been made static 72 This may break some library code the OCD library is one example 73 until it s updated for 125 We ll try to add a more informative74 error message about this in 126 757677 additions improvements 7879 Significant improvement to text and images in OpenGL mode 8 Now using mipmaps to interpolate large and small images 8182 The println method with arrays now prints the array indices next 83 to each element making it a bit more useful The print method84 no longer supports arrays since that was a bit silly 8586 Major rework of the open command This function behaves differently87 on each platform On Windows the parameters are sent to the Windows 88 shell via cmd c On Mac OS X the open command is used type 89 man open in Terminal app for documentation On Linux it first tries9 gnome open then kde open but if neither are available it sends the91 command to the shell without any alterations For Java users this 92 is not quite the same as Runtime exec because the shell command 93 is prepended The method exec String is a shortcut for 94 Runtime getRuntime exec String This function was also modified 95 for Mac OS X and Linux support and to better handle spaces in 96 command names 9798 textAlign now supports a second parameter that handles vertical 99 alignment of text The second parameter can be TOP CENTER and 1 BOTTOM 1 11 2 Added min and max for float and int arrays 1 31 4 At Casey s urging the Color Picker is now called the 1 5 Color Selector 1 61 7 Fix up MovieMaker from Dan Shiffman also add the library to 1 8 the reference pages 1 911 Re architect SVG to properly inherit fill stroke etc from parents111 g object can specify fill stroke for everyone below112 need to discern between having a fill specified and one not being present113114 Fix Find Replace button placement also add Replace Find Next option115 http

drawing inside setup didn t work and any318 basic mode applications didn t draw anything 319 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 46332 321 Remapped the home end keys on Windows Linux to be their proper 322 assignments as per the Windows UI guidelines lacking any sort of323 Linux UI guidelines Mac OS X is still stuck with begin end324 of document because Apple says so Don t like it Complain to the 325 guy in the jeans and turtleneck 326327 Should be a minor change to QTSession open and QTSession close 328 for the video library 32933 331 332333334ABOUT REV 122 28 November 2 6335336Lots of bug fixes and two new libraries 337338 features 33934 Michael Chang s Candy SVG Importer has been expanded significantly 341 and added as a core library We are grateful to Michael for his342 contribution to the project 343344 A simple XML library processing xml has been added It is based on345 NanoXML and requires documents to be very strictly formatted and346 doesn t support some XML features 347348 For both of these new libraries they are intentionally minimal 349 implementations A full XML library or a full SVG import export 35 library would be quite significant in size We think it s instead351 helpful to have libraries that can be included as part of an applet 352 meaning that they should be no larger than around 2 3 k If you 353 don t need the compact size you can use a larger XML library 354 or something like Apache s Batik to handle SVG import 355356 bug fixes 357358 Lots of work done to improve the formatting and also make the359 key combinations work more appropriately for the various platforms 36 For instance HOME and END keys now move to the beginning or end361 of the document while ctrl left and right cmd left and right on mac 362 moves to the beginning or the end of a line Outdenting when a brace363 is used and some other quirks have been ironed out more 364 Shift backspace now also produces delete which is a useful thing365 found in many programming text editors Also text selection and arrow 366 issues like http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 349367 This is one of several fixes that improve the use of the arrow keys368 along with cmd alt right left and others In general the editor 369 has been mostly brought up to spec for how keys work 37 371 Fixed the menu shortcuts for next and previous tab 372 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 4 2373374 Fixed a problem where clicking the close box of Processing then hitting375 Cancel when asked to save changes would close the window anyway 376 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 44 377378 Changed Format for Discourse to Copy for Discourse which just 379 copies the code directly to the clipboard so it can easily be38 pasted into the forum The UI was too goofy before 381 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 447382383 Forgot to mention there was a fix added in revision 12 that384 prevented files dragged into a sketch from bouncing back to the 385 desktop on Mac OS X It formerly gave the impression that the 386 file was not properly added to the sketch 387388 noiseSeed was only working once and only before noise was used 389 http processing org discourse yabb beta YaBB cgi board SoftwareBugs action display num 116285626239 391 lerpColor now honors the current color mode Also added support392 for lerpColor c1 c2 MODE where MODE is RGB or HSB 393 http processing org discourse yabb beta YaBB cgi board Suggestions action display num 116 96 87394395 Fixed a regression in P3D OPENGL that prevented points from drawing396 in some areas of the screen 397 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 444398399 Fixed earlier but not announced gray backgrounds in PDF export4 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 3244 14 24 3 4 44 54 6ABOUT REV 121 6 November 2 64 74 8Adds printing fixes a last minute createGraphics regression in 12 4 9and some other minor tweaks 41 411 features 412413 Printing a tab is now supported but with caveats 414 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 27415 The Page Setup dialog doesn t work very well because Java seems 416 to suck at printing and sucks differently on different platforms 417 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 435418 Also only the current tab is printed 419 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 2842 421 Added background with alpha parameters but only for use with 422 graphics created by createGraphics Also it replaces the pixels423 with pixels that have that alpha it s not like drawing a semi 424 transparent rect onto the screen For instance to make a drawing 425 surface transparent again use background Using426 background 128 will replace the background with black427 pixels that are 5 transparent it will not fade the existing 428 image toward black use a rect for that 42943 bug fixes 431432 size beginRecords beginRaw and createGraphics were broken 433 for file based renderers in 12 434 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 434435436 Fixed overly fat buttons on OS X due to a previous workaround that s437 no longer a problem because we re using testing the Quaqua L F 438 http www randelshofer ch quaqua 43944 Fixed a bug with hidden code causing an error inside rebuildMenu 441442443 444445446ABOUT REV 12 5 November 2 6447448Several long standing bugs fixed in this release 44945 bug fixes 451452 Fix several issues with filling shapes generated by beginShape 453 particularly when used with bezierVertex and curveVertex 454 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 97455456 Fix a regression that appeared in 116 that prevented curveVertex 457 and bezierVertex shapes from filling properly 458 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 39 45946 Fix problem that prevented polygons perpendicular to the z axis 461 from filling properly 462 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 111463464 Cancel has returned to the Save Changes dialog box 465 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 32466467 Fix several problems with createGraphics 468 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 419469 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 9247 471 Fix modelX Y Z for PGraphics3D and PGraphicsOpenGL 472 which has been broken since beta473 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 386474475 Lots of issues with createFont PDF rendering of fonts and 476 hint ENABLE NATIVE FONTS Also added lots of notes to the reference477 based on frequently asked questions 478479 maintain selection current tab and scroll position on save as 48 http processing org bugs show bug cgi id 86481482 Fixed issue where ambientLight r g b was instead ambientLight r g r 483 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 412484485 functional improvements 486487 With the PDF library text no longer defaults to raw shape outlines 488 Details and a means to revert to the old behavior in the reference 489 http processing org reference libraries pdf 49 491 Trying the Quaqua Look Feel on Mac OS X with the hope of things 492 looking better Not sure if we ll keep this The main issue it fixes493 is that it improves the Swing dialogs for file choosers however494 another workaround was found for that so now it mostly just improves495 the Save changes dialogs 496497 Trying the GTK Look Feel on Linux The old default Metal from498 Java was truly dreadful 4995 When Auto Format produces a warning no code will be changed In some5 1 cases this was mangling code so to be safe it s been disabled 5 2 Near term we d like to swap out Auto Format with new code altogether 5 35 4 Using createGraphics now properly creates an empty completely 5 5 transparent drawing surface that can be written to a file The alpha5 6 channel will also be written for the file if using a file format5 7 such as PNG that supports transparency 5 85 9If this is the first release you re using since 115 or earlier 51 please read the section below that contains the release notes for 116 511512513 514515516ABOUT REV 119 1 October 2 6517518Mostly minor bug fix release 51952 Fixed support for java files which haven t been working since 116 521 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 4 5522523 Rename the Capture example to avoid problems with Export524 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 4 8525526 Added workaround for Java 1 5 issue where openStream and therefore 527 loadImage were throwing a different exception than Java 1 4 528 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 4 352953 Added saveStream and unlerp methods as testing for teh API 531 Documentation will probably be limited to the developer

contains the release notes for 116 553554555 556557558ABOUT REV 117 1 October 2 655956 This release fixes a problem with release 116 that made exported561sketches much larger than necessary because extra files were included 562563If this is the first release you re using since 115 or earlier 564please read the section below that contains the release notes for 116 565566567 56856957 ABOUT REV 116 28 September 2 6571572This is a major release It contains a million billion bug fixes 573as well as several API changes as we try to firm up the API for 1 574575 PLEASE READ ALL THESE NOTES CAREFULLY 576 YOUR CODE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED 577578If you don t want to update your code yet and are just trying to get579your coursework done you may want to stick with release 115 58 581 The reference has received major updates The contents of the FAQ582 have now been integrated into the reference The remaining page583 of the FAQ has more details about where everyone went 584 http processing org faq html585586 framerate is now called frameRate for better API consistency 587 It didn t make sense to have a frameCount variable and a framerate 588 method as its misshapen cousin 58959 The default frameRate is now 6 fps This will prevent some odd591 quirks with sketches running faster than they need to and throttling592 the resources of your machine To disable this you can set the 593 frameRate arbitrarily high 594595 beginShape has changed LINE LOOP and LINE STRIP have been 596 removed because they are redundant and not consistent with the 597 rest of the API beginShape POLYGON is no longer recommended 598 simply use beginShape with no parameters when drawing an599 irregular shape Code examples 6 6 1 OLD SYNTAX 6 2 beginShape POLYGON 6 3 call vertex several times6 4 endShape 6 56 6 NEW SYNTAX 6 7 beginShape 6 8 call vertex several times6 9 endShape CLOSE 61 611 endShape with the CLOSE parameter will make the stroke on your612 shape continue back to where the shape started This is the same613 way that POLYGON and LINE LOOP worked 614615 OLD SYNTAX 616 beginShape LINE STRIP 617 draw with vertex 618 endShape 61962 NEW SYNTAX 621 noFill 622 beginShape 623 draw with vertex 624 endShape 625626 In the above case noFill must be called and the CLOSE parameter 627 to endShape is not used because the last point should not come 628 back to meet the original point 62963 OLD SYNTAX 631 beginShape LINE LOOP 632 draw with vertex 633 endShape 634635 NEW SYNTAX 636 noFill 637 beginShape 638 draw with vertex 639 endShape CLOSE 64 641 For the LINE LOOP example endShape CLOSE is used to specify close the642 shape noFill must also be called so that the shape is not filled in 643644 The two main problems with the old API were 1 LINE LOOP was simply a 645 POLYGON with no fill setting this made for a strange inconsistency 646 2 there was no way to draw a non closed POLYGON shape 647648 Using beginShape POLYGON doesn t make much sense when you re drawing 649 a line so this is one more reason that beginShape with no parameters65 is recommended 651652 The single pixel blend methods have been removed they were 653 overkill Also the blend function that blends a color instead654 of image data is now called blendColor 655656 Along with blendColor a lerpColor method has been added 657 It works just like lerp but with colors 658659 writer and reader are now createWriter and createReader 66 These weren t really documented so the change doesn t officially661 count per se but maybe someone was using em 662663 toInt and toFloat are now parseInt and parseFloat 664 to change to JavaScript syntax Not sure if anyone was using these 665666 Text with the JAVA2D setting no longer uses native fonts by default 667 which means they ll be slower and uglier See the reference for668 textFont for details and how it can be addressed 66967 Threading has been modified signficantly Some of these changes 671 had to be undone at the last minute so further changes are coming 672 The changes will fix several strange InterruptedException problems 673674675 major changes to PGraphics and its subclasses 676677 The PGraphics classes have all been reworked and renamed 678679 PGraphics is an abstract class on which additional PGraphics68 subclasses can be built It is an abstract class and therefore681 cannot be invoked directly 682683 PGraphics2D P2D contains the former contents of PGraphics that 684 are specific to 2D rendering This will be P2D once it is complete 685686 PGraphics3D P3D formerly PGraphics3 remains mostly unchanged 687688 PGraphicsJava2D JAVA2D formerly PGraphics2 is the renderer 689 used when you call for size width height JAVA2D It remains 69 the default renderer when none is specified It is slower but 691 more accurate than the others 692693 PGraphicsOpenGL OPENGL is the new name for PGraphicsGL 694695 Do not use new PGraphics to create PGraphics objects 696 Instead use createGraphics which will properly handle connecting697 the new graphics object to its parent sketch and will enable save 698 to work properly See the reference for createGraphics 699 http processing org reference createGraphics html7 7 1 For the same reasons as above createImage width height format 7 2 should be used instead of new PImage when creating images 7 3 http processing org reference createImage html7 47 5 PImage objects default to ARGB instead of RGB format This is 7 6 helpful for using createImage or createGraphics to generate7 7 a transparent surface Be sure to use PNG or another format that7 8 supports alpha 7 971 beginFrame and endFrame are now beginDraw and endDraw 711 Use these around drawing commands to a PGraphics created by712 createGraphics The defaults method should not need not713 be called just beginDraw and endDraw 714 715716 other additions and enhancements 717718 Added an option to Preferences that sets the available memory 719 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 23372 721 Added a menu option to switch between tabs722 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 55723 however there s a problem where it sometimes stops working 724 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 4 2725726 The OpenGL library has been updated to use the final release 727 of JOGL 1 released September 2 6 rather than beta 4 found728 in release 115 72973 The flag in PApplet main formerly called present stop color 731 is now simply stop color A flag named hide stop has also 732 been added to prevent users from quitting out of a present mode 733 application see the faq on details for capturing ESC as well 734735 Altered mouse behavior so that mouse positions update only on 736 mouseMoved and mouseDragged this also fixes a macosx bug that 737 caused mouseX Y values to be bizarre because mouseExited 738 gave weird positions workaround for apple bug 73974 The Export Folder Tool has been removed if temporarily 741742 Archive Sketch now prompts for a sketch name it was awkward743 trying to dig the sketches

151 16 The main reason for the lack of applet support is simply that 1 17 I haven t yet had time to try to get this to work An enterprising 1 18 individual might give this a shot if they have a chance to look1 19 into how this is done with the new JOGL known as JSR 231 There1 2 are jar files for jogl that will be exported with a p5 applet 1 21 that are signed by Sun Note that the version for Mac OS X does1 22 not support Intel Macs The jnilib files were built on my own 1 23 but the jar files were left intact because of the signing 1 24 1 25 The release of JOGL is the nightly build dated 22 March

open the window since it doesn t work properly 1262 with sizes larger than the screen size as might often be the case when1263 rendering to a file 12641265 if you want to record just a single frame

used by appletviewer or cause applets to start at their1479 correct size then resize to 1 x1 and then resize to their correct148 location once setup was complete 148114821483 api 14841485 hint DISABLE DEPTH TEST will disable the zbuffer in P3D or OPENGL 1486 re enable with noHint DISABLE DEPTH TEST 14871488 added methods for libraries to be able to get sketch folder paths 1489 the variable folder which was changed to path for rev 94 is149 now called sketchPath and won t change again see the javadoc 1491 reference on dev processing org for more details on this and the1492 additional functions 1493 sketchPath returns the path to a file in the sketch folder 1494 dataPath returns the path to a file inside the data folder 1495 createPath will take any path and make sure that the 1496 interstitial folders exist this is used by saveFrame and 1497 savePath to make sure that the parent folders exist 1498 for instance saveFrame image blah tif will use createPath 1499 to ensure that the folder image exists inside the sketch folder 15 savePath is like sketchPath but uses createPath to make 15 1 sure that it s save to save there 15 2 this will probably break the libraries again but hopefully with 15 3 this change they should stop breaking going forward 15 415 5 changed unhint to noHint to match the rest of the api 15 6 i don t think anyone was using this so hopefully it won t affect 15 7 anything 15 815 9151 misc 15111512 macosx release is now packaged with as a dmg instead of a sitx1513 http dev processing org bugs show bug cgi id 11615141515 added reference category to

think of a good name 2 122 13 that whole thing with passing null or to the camera constructor2 14 was really silly now either one will just give you the default2 15 video input device 2 162 17 added

24 crop x y w h uses the current imageMode from the parent2 25 applet will crop the video before putting it into its PImage 2 26 this is almost always used internally because qt likes to add2 27 black bars to the image but you can now specify your own 2 28 settings to crop things further2 292 3 noCrop will remove any cropping providing a speed increase 2 312 32 there may be bugs things were

around will usually halt it especially2 91 with opengl 2 922 93 println is super slow2 942 95 moving the main p5 window to another screen just gets thrown out 2 96 to prevent a case where a second

api changes in this release 21 721 8we re nearing the end of our general f ing with the api but we ve21 9once again broken things this time we ve moved around how renderers211 work 21112112 depth is gone and so is the renderer menu in its place we2113 have a new method for specifying how you want to render 21142115 so now size 2 2 this allocates a 2D buffer to draw into 2116 using the Java2D engine or the original 1 1 compliant engine depending 2117 on whether or not you re using Java 1 3 or higher 21182119 or this gets the original processing 2D renderer 212 which is often better for pixel operations though is currently quite2121 borked lines and whatnot don t work properly 2122 size 2 2 P2D 21232124 this provides the original processing 3D renderer 2125 size 2 2 P3D 21262127 and this loads drum roll opengl 2128 size 2 2 OPENGL 2129213 gl glXxxxXxx no longer works because the base applet is just a 2131 regular PApplet not a PAppletGL this is a bummer but a small2132 price to pay for all the goodness that comes with the way that2133 the new size function works in order to get the gl object to 2134 draw to use the following ugly piece of code 2135 GL gl PGraphicsGL g gl 2136 you may also want need to add the following import statement 2137 did you know we support imports not sure if this was mentioned2138 back around 7 or whenever they were implemented 2139 import net java games jogl GL 214 2141 the applet placement sizing and window issues should now be sorted2142 out completely no more windows showing up in weird places or applets2143 being offset strangely within them 21442145 present mode has been rewritten to use java s proper full screen api 2146 no more ghetto full screen with menubar on osx should be more stable2147 than it was in the past also note that things running in presentation2148 mode will run using an external java vm rather than inside the 2149 environment itself 215 2151 processing itself requires java 1 4 it s sort of required it for a 2152 little while but this is now made explicit in the code if you re lucky2153 a new erorr dialog will pop up and tell you to install a newer version 2154 if you try running under 1 3 or whatever 21552156 background PImage should now be working in opengl21572158 saveFrame path bug fixed2159216 preferences madness2161 preferences panel is now a modal dialog and doesn t hide the 2162 editor window in the weird way it used to 2163 you can also click the link to the preferences txt file and it ll 2164 open in whatever your default text editor is on your machine 2165 editor font size is now a preference that can be set from the 2166 prefs window 2167 fixed a bug where prefs were applied even if you hit cancel 21682169 lots more internal fixes and tweaking that we ll be documenting 217 soon i e the new renderer setup means pluggable renderers or 2171 PApplet has lots of fancy command line options like present 217221732174 other bits to note 21752176 it should also be noted again that java 1 1 stuff is almost 2177 completely unusable in this release the PApplet class temporarily2178 contains some 1 4 specific code which will be removed and the2179 graphics engine still doesn t work so this version isn t useful218 for exporting things to the web 21812182 there are a bunch of bugs with save save as quirky things 2183 about folders not winding up in the right place and whatnot 2184 looking to fix these this week21852186 release 82 or 83 will be all about getting proper 3D lighting 2187 camera and geometry working simon s done some amazing work 21882189 if anyone s looking at the cvs you ll need to do a 219 cvs update d P because the folder structure has moved around2191 for this release 219221932194 219521962197ABOUT REV 8 2 April 2 521982199bug fix and api tweaking

in the22 7 applet text the format is a javadoc comment where the first line22 8 should contain and the final line so the following would work 22 9 221 You can t rock Processing like I can rock Processing 2211 2212 and that text would automatically be embedded in the exported html 2213 page like a javadoc comment the text can and should be any valid2214 html since it s just gonna get

2279228 cosmetic fixes only in today s release we lost our internet connection2281last night before i could post rev 78 for windows so if casey returns2282from his meeting soon enough we ll also post a rev 79 for windows and 2283just skip 78 since we didn t get to it 22842285 you must delete your preferences txt file for this release 2286 otherwise things are gonna look super ugly 2287 on macosx Library Processing preferences txt2288 on windows Documents and Settings username 2289 Application Data Processing preferences txt229 2291 the ui is now blonde casey decided that it was time to go horizontal 2292 with the toolbar buttons drunk with power he wound up re coloring2293 everything while he was at it as a result your prefs need to be nuked2294 the first time you run with this release 22952296 added a status bar at the bottom of the screen that displays the 2297 current line number or range this is an interim solution until2298 we can put in real line numbers but hopefully this does the trick2299 for a while since the text editor component we use doesn t support23 line numbers 23 123 2 ctrl O added for the Open menu item don t get too wild 23 323 423 5 23 623 723 8ABOUT REV 78 3 March 2 523 9231 this release includes a large number of fixes for the 2D graphics engine 2311nothing has changed in the processing 3D engine what you get when you 2312call depth however the OpenGL renderer now supports loadPixels 2313updatePixels saveFrame get and pmouseX Y 23142315around the corner are big fixes to 3D when simon finishes the new 2316lighting model he s moving through it pretty quickly so we hope to have2317it in a release shortly 23182319232 major things still not solved since last release 23212322 still lots of threading flickering strangeness23232324 applet not being placed properly inside its window23252326 things sometims not starting up gives a cryptic error in the console 23272328 text inside a rect is slightly broken2329233 you can t do per vertex coloring of lines in 2D23312332 everything else not covered here that was broken in 77 233323342335api changes 23362337 fun things some of the filter stuff in PImage now works 2338 filter GRAY will convert a PImage to grayscale 2339 filter INVERT will invert an image234 filter POSTERIZE int levels will posterize to that many levels2341 filter THRESHOLD or filter THRESHOLD float midpoint 2342 will give you a black and white image with optionally settable2343 midpoint a value from to 1 2344 coming soon is filter BLUR and filter BLUR float radius 23452346 strokeCap strokeJoin constants for MITERED is now MITER BEVELED is BEVEL 2347 and PROJECTED is now PROJECT 23482349 as of 77 font width works differently it returns the width of235 a one point font not the font at its current size the font api2351 built into PGraphics PApplet now consists of 23522353 public void textFont PFont which 2354 public void textFont PFont which float size 2355 public void textSize float size 2356 public void textLeading float leading 2357 public void textMode int mode 2358 public void textSpace int space 2359 public float textAscent 236 public float textDescent 2361 public float textWidth char c 2362 public float textWidth String s 23632364 instead of using PFont width or PFont ascent to get the size of2365 text you should use textWidth or textAscent in PGraphics PApplet2366 which will return values based on what was set in textSize 23672368 bezierVertex has changed instead of four calls to bezierVertex 2369 you should instead use 237 vertex x1 y1 2371 bezierVertex x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4 2372 this helps iron out some inconsistencies that you get with the wrong2373 number of bezierVertex coords it also prevents you from having to 2374 double up the final coordinate to draw the next segment 23752376 got rid of CONCAVE POLYGON and CONVEX POLYGON since they never really2377 came into full use 23782379238 bug fixes 23812382 curveVertex works again 23832384 lines of text were getting mashed together both horizontally and2385 vertically the font stuff was moved around a lot in 77 and so2386 this made a mess of things 23872388 backwards rectangles and ellipses are now drawn properly i e 2389 rectangles where x2 x1 or y2 y1 or ellipses with a 239 negative width or height 23912392 same thing for backwards images note that an image drawn backwards2393 won t actually flip the image or anything nutty like that 23942395 the file open dialog on macosx now lets you open files ending 2396 with all caps PDE instead of pde23972398 imageMode was broken239924 loadPixels updatePixels save and saveFrame were totally broken 24 1 and now they work in both the Java2D and OpenGL renderers 24 224 3 patched in the latest version of jogl to hopefully fix some of the24 4 overly chatty error messages 24 524 6 SCREEN SPACE text is working again24 724 8 tint is now working properly except that it ignores colors but24 9 accepts alpha with PGraphics3 processing renderer with depth 241 2411 arc was broken and inconsistent now fixed 24122413 several bug fixes inside Camera and Movie 24142415 PImage get had a bug where it wouldn t properly read data as2416 you neared or crossed any of the edges of the image 24172418 bug in the gl renderer that had images drawing the wrong size shape 2419242 default strokeCap and strokeJoin now set 242124222423 242424252426ABOUT REV 77 1 March 2 524272428 PLEASE READ THIS INFORMATION BEFORE POSTING TO THE BETA LIST 2429243 this is another release where processing has undergone massive2431changes hopefully it is hopefully more stable than 75 and 76 2432and i m ready to take bug reports again 243324342435changes important notes 24362437 whenever you use 3D in this release you must use the depth command2438 inside of setup preferably just before or after size having2439 tried to keep the 2D rendering together it s just become too messy244 and error prone to continue 24412442 after editing the pixels of an image you must use the new method2443 updatePixels this became necessary because of the Java 2D2444 renderer as well as OpenGL it s unfortunate but it s all we can2445 do so after messing with pixels for the main surface or doing2446 the same with an image call updatePixels to mark the entire image2447 as modified or call updatePixels x y w h to update just a2448 portion this is currently no faster but later will represent an2449 optimization 245 2451 you ll also need to use loadPixels on any PGraphics object 2452 before reading its pixels and messing with its pixels buffer 24532454 using size with actual numbers as opposed to variables is2455 strongly recommended there s no reason to use size WIDTH HEIGHT 2456 because the variables width height can be used for the same2457 purpose after size has been called this helps the export 2458 command and also becomes very important with opengl 2459246 rendering this release represents a significant change to how2461 rendering is handled all of the graphics has been split into2462 multiple classes which are 24632464 PGraphics 2D rendering with Java 1 1 2465 this is the old renderer but it has been semi disabled2466 in the current release this means that things won t 2467 draw properly or at all in 2D in most web browsers 2468 where the java plugin is not installed this renderer2469 will no longer support smooth and noSmooth 247 2471 PGraphics2 2D rendering for systems using Java 1 3 2472 this is used dynamically whenever the applet detects2473 that it is running on a Java 1 3 system 2474 it is an entirely new and complete renderer based2475 on Java2D this was a shortcut to get a renderer that2476 worked properly on the vast majority of machines in2477 our target audience courses beginners developers 2478 until i have time to complete the 1 1 renderer so2479 that exporting to the web works again basically 248 i ve sold out in hope of ever reaching 1 24812482 PGraphics3 3D rendering in Java 1 12483 this is loaded when the depth command is executed2484 inside of setup any applet requiring 3D must now2485 explicitly state depth inside setup the renderer2486 is composed of the 3D components from the old2487 renderer although it s using sumea sami s newer2488 triangle rendering meaning that things are much2489 faster than before although textures are a little249 fuggly there are no plans to support smooth in 2491 this mode for smoothing use the OpenGL renderer 2492 stroke caps joins will also probably not work in this 2493 mode lines are 2D objects how do you put a stroke2494 on a 3D object but that hasn t yet been fully2495 determined 24962497 PGraphicsGL OpenGL renderer for use in Java 1 3 2498 jogl requires java 1 3 and this rendering option can2499 just be selected from a menu this handles both 2D25 and 3D and will actually ignore the depth command25 1 though you should still use it with opengl apps for25 2 good practice 25 325 4 PMethods an interface for plug in file based renderers 25 5 for instance to write a postscript renderer one25 6 need only implement the PMethods interface with25 7 your class then at the beginning of draw use 25 8 recordFrame psRenderer 25 9 which will echo all rendering calls to that251 class until the end of the frame this handles2511 writing to files we won t be supporting plug in2512 visual renderers in Processing 1 unless you want2513 to use this to open up a separate window or something2514 weird like that 25152516 if you re curious or filing a bug report you can always check what2517 the current rendering engine is by using println g getClass 25182519 very exciting strokeWeight strokeCap strokeJoin et al 252 now work when using 2D and using Java 1 3 or higher these will 2521 eventually work in Java 1 1 for 2D as well 25222523 the new renderers may change the speed of some things significantly 2524 for instance using text on java 1 3 when depth hasn t been called2525 PGraphics2 may be far slower than before or using images in the same2526 situation may require much more RAM on the other hand smoothed shapes2527 and general drawing in the same situation might be much faster 25282529 i m trying to think of a means to switch between the java 1 3 version 253 of the 2D api and the 1 1 version in case people want to force use of2531 the old one once it s working again we ll see 25322533 presumably the separation of the rendering engines also means that2534 one could post a web applet that doesn t include the 3D rendering2535 code if your applet is only 2D or vice versa 25362537 pmouseX and pmouseY have returned and are better than ever 25382539 firstMouse boolean variable added which is set true when the254 mouse gets its first legitimate mouse coordinate naming for this2541 var will likely change in a future release 25422543 arc command has been added it s just like ellipse 2544 arc x y w h start stop 2545 and uses ellipseMode for its placement 25462547 circle has been removed it was a dumb duplication with ellipse 2548 it s not as though we have a square function to go with rect 2549255 because of the separation of the 2D and 3D renderers it should be2551 possible to create much larger PGraphics objects and for them to use2552 far less memory than before 25532554 light commands work though things seem to look super ugly by2555 default they re more correct when using OpenGL and perhaps if2556 placed more explicitly you may get better results 25572558 the alpha command that sets the alpha mask is now called2559 mask this is to avoid the name clash with the red green 256 blue alpha functions 25612562 imageMode CORNER and CORNERS are the only valid image modes 2563 imageMode affects get copy blend etc so it was just too2564 weird to have the CENTER functions operating in that mode results2565 would have been very strange and unexpected 25662567 box and sphere should be working again with opengl25682569 die is a newish internal function that s used whenever exceptions 257 or internal errors occur you can make your own error handler by2571 overriding die String s and die String s Exception e if you d2572 like your applet to do something smarter than just halting we re2573 moving to where exceptions and errors are handled in a more2574 consistent way and that no p5 methods will require try and catch2575 style exception handling for advanced users who want it they can2576 use the java equivalents of the various PApplet methods 257725782579ide fun258 2581 forgot to mention in rev 75 that double clicking a pde file on the2582 mac will now launch processing with that sketch someday windows will2583 do this too someday 25842585 i ve replaced the cvs version of jikes that we d been using with2586 jikes 1 22 a real release and the very latest it s only 2 or 3MB2587 instead of 8 or 9MB and crashes much less yay the reason we can2588 make the switch is that 1 22 supports target 1 1 again it had2589 disappeared in some of the previous releases and it s absolutely259 essential for p5 259125922593serial library25942595 serialEvents are now fired after each byte has been received 25962597 added buffer int count method to Serial to set the number of2598 bytes to receive before firing a serialEvent 259926 added bufferUntil int whatByte method to Serial that will buffer 26 1 until that byte has been received and then call serialEvent 26 226 3 these changes were simple code but haven t been tested so they26 4 may be prone to errors let me know 26 526 6 just one function prompt which will bring up a list of serial 26 7 ports in a nice window remains to finish the Serial library 26 8 everything else is considered complete barring a revolt by the 26 9 itp physical computing guys 261 26112612known bugs26132614 the examples have not been updated they re getting pretty crufty 2615 but i ve been making such a mess of the api that i ve made casey2616 hold off until things settle down a bit before updating 26172618 curveVertex is temporarily broken in this release 2619262 export to web is temporarily broken in this release for machines2621 that don t have the java plug in installed this includes 6 of2622 Windows users on the web and anyone using Mac OS 8 or 9 the applet2623 will export but will turn up mostly blank on machines with Java 1 1 2624 to publish things to the web you might want to use an earlier2625 release or force people to upgrade their java vm somehow 26262627 windows coming up at the wrong size or with the wrong placement 2628 make sure you re using size nnn nnn where nnn are actual2629 numbers if you re doing that and still seeing trouble please263 report how to reproduce 26312632 on macosx maybe windows too applets sometimes come up with their2633 top 2 pixels or so missing working on a fix 26342635 when using opengl the Using ATI workaround error message isn t 2636 really an error it s just something that jogl spits out fret not 2637 same with that can t get focus error that often shows up on the2638 mac i don t think there s anything i can do about either 2639264 lighting is fuggly i have a feeling that normals aren t being set2641 up properly partly because that code has gotten no love for a long2642 time and everything around it has changed 26432644 several reported ide bugs with save as hide and others remain 2645 i hope to fix these in the next release 26462647 tint does not work properly in depth mode and using the 2648 processing renderer PGraphics3 2649265 2651 265226532654ABOUT REV 7626552656this was a quick release that fixed launcher issues on both mac os x2657and windows it meant being distracted uploading a new build during2658part of the third quarter of the super bowl but you guys are just2659that important luckily the patriots still won 266 26612662 266326642665ABOUT REV 7526662667 DON T USE THIS RELEASE IF YOU RE ON ANY SORT OF MEDICATION 2668this is truly an alpha release or more like a nightly build 2669267 i m posting this release early so that people can play with2671opengl if you aren t one of those just dying to get started with2672gl wait until a few days or so when i can get 76 out that irons out2673some of the nastier bugs you needn t post bug reports on things that2674are broken since i know many many things are horked a massive number2675of changes have happened in this release and i wanted to get it posted2676because i was starting to lose track of them all 267726782679things that i know or suspect are broken 268 2681 the examples have not been updated26822683 windows sometimes pop up at the wrong sizes 26842685 opengl doesn t behave properly in static draw mode things aren t2686 sized properly 26872688 the processing renderer has taken some steps backwards and things2689 like ellipses might be broken 269 2691 lots of random tidbits in rendering not quite working 26922693 drawing images in opengl whose pixel buffer has been edited won t2694 work quite right 26952696 text may pop up sized incorrectly 26972698 noLoop framerate n redraw are not yet supported for opengl269927 and much much more 27 127 227 3general 27 427 5 you now need to use the command depth to enable 3D noDepth 27 6 shuts it off and moves back to 2D only with optimizations support27 7 for this is incomplete 27 827 9 hanging bug should now be completely eliminated 271 2711 under sketch a renderer menu that lets you select OpenGL or the2712 processing renderer 27132714 preprocessor makes all methods public that aren t specified2715 private or protected this makes things easier for library events2716 see libraries section below and things like setup draw 271727182719core272 2721 added focusGained and focusLost events27222723 added beginShape TRIANGLE FAN 27242725 removed pmouseX and pmouseY because they can t be used 272627272728libraries2729273

this will get rid of the localization issues on non US versions of2751 these operation systems 2752 the info is read from the os on mac and registry keys on2753 windows and is also used to place the Processing sketchbook inside2754 Documents on mac or My Documents or whatever it s called in the2755 current language on the pc 27562757 rename delete have returned when renaming deleting on the2758 first tab it renames or deletes the entire sketch 2759276 saving a read only sketch now defaults to the sketchbook2761 rather than the same read only location it was coming from 27622763 build fixes preproc gets built properly and dmg for osx27642765 cosmetic single pixel layout issues fixed on osx27662767 no more resize box annoyance in the editor on osx27682769 fixes to the horizontal scrollbar

libraries are built as 1 1 code like everything else so things with28 1 particles can be exported again28 228 3 fixed a minor bug that prevented non smoothed fonts from being 28 4 created in the font builder on macosx due to apple s creativity 28 5 with the java spec28 628 728 8 28 9281 2811ABOUT REV 7228122813bug fix release most major being that the code folder should now be2814working again and error messages from libraries may have an easier2815time of propogating upwards 28162817BUGS28182819 code folder works again 282 2821 the code folder hanging bug may have been fixed either by a fix2822 from francis li or by the error message changes by me keep your2823 fingers crossed 28242825 loadImage is broken on some machines a small hack has been2826 introduced to get around this hopefully it doesn t break for2827 everyone else as a result of the hack the cache setting on2828 images is temporarily ignored 2829283 hint unhint settings were static variables meaning that they d2831 stick around per processing session which is too long 283228332834API STUFF28352836 g m g m 1 etc are now public28372838 error message shows up when a library isn t available2839284 2841

deal with your code breaking then2917wait until the beta 29182919as of this release we re also returning to more truly alpha status292 for releases from 7 until beta releases will happen more frequently2921 hopefully and increment more quickly however we won t be2922announcing a new release to the greater public until beta at which2923time we ll be done breaking everyone s code more

uses void draw to draw a static293 image you need to add the line noLoop to setup or to the first2931 line of the draw method itself 29322933 for any programs that use void loop you need to change its name2934 to void draw 29352936 BImage BFont BGraphics etc are all PImage PFont PGraphics 2937 you ll need to rename them in your program 29382939 libraries will almost certainly need to be rewritten for this294 release we re working with amit on an update to sonia and several2941 other libraries will be included in future releases 29422943 mouse and key events are now properly queued meaning that functions2944 like mousePressed and keyPressed will be called at the end of2945 your draw method this means that you can draw inside of those2946 methods just note that it ll happen after all other
