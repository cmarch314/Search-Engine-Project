{"text": "Gio s Movie files DOC Movies Database Documentation This the Master file on brambles MyDocs mov doc html copyright 1996 1997 1998 Gio Wiederhold Loaded into DB web files 25 September 1997 Updated December 1998 This material was entered by Gio Wiederhold The initial objective was as test data for students to allow non trivial exercises There are fields suitable for complex joins outerjoins temporal joins and recursion It has also been used to investigate object structured database technologies This is a HTML version of the description of the movies database It was based originally on the description from the Kamens and Wiederhold temporal paper It also contains literature references in appendix A 1 Introduction The database was used originally in implementing the temporal queries in SQL is Wiederhold s movies database see 21 and for a number of other projects both in Stanford classes and by research at the Un of Maryland and others The database allows testing of theories about an implementation Since it contains real data it allowing checking of results for semantic as well as syntactic correctness Finally the tables in the database consist of both journal and history relations see 21 section 3 allowing us to test all of the different elements of an implementation The Overview section 2 below contains a summary of all the files and the URL pointers to them or their parts or sections see Section 3 for a full schema description A number of the fields are unsuitable for relational implementation because they contain sets of values These are best used in an object capable implementation The schema describes when such sets are to be expected Encodings for several of the fields are listed in Section 4 At the end of this document in Appendix B are some conversion rules for converting the HTML format to fields for relational or object databases 2 Overview The central file MAIN is a list of movies each with a unique identifier These identifiers may change in successive versions The actors CAST for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file More information about individual actors ACTORS is in a third file All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file PEOPLE with a number of important producers writers and cinematographers A fifth file REMAKES links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other The sixth file STUDIOS provides some information about studios show in MAIN This documentation file provides supplementary information and is an essential part of the database Some images are also available but not on line now There are many cross linking names throughout the files so many in fact that web browsers have choked when trying to make them live Currently we simply try to be careful in naming films and people consistently More detail follows below Counts have been made using emacs count matches 2 1 MOVIES The main movies file is main html It contains 11435 tr td table row entries July 1999 It is complete for Hitchcock movies and TV shows and has most films that can be related by topic actors director history and such to those films It has also many films corresponding to a variety of interests of mine former students etc with an emphasis on historical value MAIN is the central relation in the database it is a journal relation that contains information about the movies themselves The relation contains information about movies such as their titles type directors and producers as well as their year of release There is also a subset file of 82 Hitchcock full length Movies 2 2 ACTORS The file actors html has 6813 tr td table row entries July 1999 for many of the actors appearing in CASTS Also First part and Second part of actors html not maintained The key of the relation is stagename and there are intervals indicating the dates that the actor worked and the actor s lifetime Other information in this relation is the actor s real name background and the type of roles he she typically plays References to images are kept here too 2 3 DIRECTORS in file people html The file lists all directors as well as some other movie people as producers and cinematographers A total of 329 tr td table row entries 3 11 directors as of July 1999 The directors table is similar to the actors table in that it contains intervals for when the director worked and when he she lived The key of the relation is the field name which is the name under which the director directed Director s key names do not contain any blanks Typically the last name is used when needed prefaced by an initial A secondary unique key is defined for each director up to three letters based on the initial letters of the first middle and last names This key will provide HTML HREF linkages among many of the files As with the actors table this table also includes the real name of the director among its fields lastname and firstname It also contains importat producers cinematographers musicians and composers etc 2 4 STUDIOS in file studios html are important studios only 2 3 tr td entries sparse information The key of the studios relation is the name of the studio The temporal information that is included is an interval indicating the years the studio was or is in operation represented by the fields startdate and enddate This is a history relation 2 5 CASTS in file casts html This is a large too large file of who acted as what in which movie 46 9 tr td entries only partial for movies and roletypes July 1999 Casts is an association relation linking actors with movies The key of the relation is the catenation of the two fields film id and actor no temporal information is included in this relation This file was too big for Netscape in 1996 so that also five working subsets were made available however these are not kept up to date casts of Hitchcock films casts Part 1 directors coded A B casts Part 2 directors coded C H casts Part 3 directors coded H O casts Part 4 directors coded P Z The four parts are still large files 6 15 entries castsCH includes Hitchcock films 2 6 REMAKES in file remakes html 1278 tr td entries in July 1999 This table which is not extensively used in the temporal DB paper gives information about movies that are remakes of other movies It is very useful to test recursion in databases 2 7 SYNONYMS This file has been superseded All entries are now in the main file as Alt T in the notes field synonyms html contained 379 entries in Sep 1997 This list relates to the MOVIES in main html Some movies are known by alternate titles and can be accessed indirectly via this file 2 8 QUOTES in file casts html QUOTES A few 26 memorable quotes from movies are listed in quotes html 1 2 9 AWARDS in file actors html Types of awards and the awarding agencies are in awtypes html 2 1 AWARDS RECEIVED is no longer a distinct file Awards received for special occasions are listed with individual entries in the files for ACTORS actors html or MOVIE PEOPLE people html Regular awards associated with a particular movies are given in MOVIES main html and with a particular performance are listed in CASTS casts html 2 11 REFERENCES Books that provided material for this database are listed within this documentation file as Appendix A 2 12 GEOGRAPHY Codes for countries and origins are listed within this documentation file as section 4 3 doc html GEO 2 13

subfields in various files are listed within this documentation file as Section 4 2 doc html FIELDS 2 17 AWARD TYPES Lists the award types used in MAIN ACTORS and PEOPLE with the organizations who award them and the span of years they were awarded 2 19 IMAGES there is a small collection of tiff files for actors and directors They are kept individually in an images subdirectory 2 2 ICONS There are about a dozan icons to be used to identify subfiles Some of them come from the New Yorker Magazine Jan 1993 There are kept individually in an icons subdirectory 3 Schema Definition for the Movies Database Here we give a detailed description of the schema of the movies database which is used for all examples in this paper and was used to implement the temporal SQL additions General descriptions are given in Section 2 above This file is being updated to desctribe the HTML version Where updates were made the old material is in curly brackets 3 1 The MOVIES Table Col Name Description There is a distinct table for each director Hitchcock has multiple tables one for early silent one for British one for American and one for TV movies The tables are broken up p by year of first known film by the directors There are some break and header records for each year Each director table has two types of records one header record for the director with the director id as shown in people the first year known for movies by that director prefixed by an symbol matching the people entry and the standard name for the director also matching the people entry The remainder shows the format for the data records that follow below The note field is often used to describe the set of detail records For movies where the director in not known there is a dummy entry either by topic Unknown or by year UnYear as shown in the people file any number of records one per film formatted as shown below film id An internally generated id for the film This is the key of the relation entries and is unique It is composed of director id and a sequence number All movies of a director are listed together in sequence but only for some directors have all movies been entered The sequence numbers often have gaps to allow insertions when all movies for this director were not known at entry time at time of entry a common occurrence title The film s title It is preceded by T or Tn earlier also Tm Tmm depending on the source of the data This field is not neccessarily unique year Year the movie was released This is assumed to be an event i e to take zero time director Director of the movie preceded by D The standardized id name is used All directors must appear as DIRECTORS in people html so that we have a proper reference constraint If there are multiple candidate directors the primary one or the one who finished the movie is chosen and other candidates are given in the notes field as CoD producers Producer s of the movie preceded by P if shown in people html and hence referencable by id name P alone shows that there was no specific producer If prefaced by PN then the full name s is are given if prefaced by PZ then the spelling is uncertain In both cases no reference to people can be expected PN is common since only few id names for producers exist yet in the people html files except for producers who also were DIRECTORS PU alone means the producer is unknown to me Multiple producers are permitted and common studios Studio s where the movie was filmed Common studio names appear in STUDIOS If the studio is not known or uncommon its location may be given as SL COUNTRY CODE Unknown studios are prefixed by SU sometimes the distributing studio where the distributor differs from the production studio is shown prefixed by SD prc Process used to make the movie e g black and white as bnw col Color processes may by specified as COLOR CODES The code cld is used for black and white movies that have been colorized Unknown is coded prc cat Category of the film e g suspense mystery as given in the list of CATEGORIES Unknown is coded Ctxx awards Awards received by the film separated by commas The awards are listed in AWARD optionally followed by keywords such as Special and included actual awards as well as favorable mostly mentions in compendia as Halliwell and Roger Ebert s books with the appropriate number of stars A symbol is a half star and a after the awardee code indicates a negative mention Unknown is coded aw H means not in Halliwell 4 lc Location where the film plays Multiple locations are separated by semicolons multiple levels in any location hierarchy are separated by commas as high school csd CA indicating movie location is a California high school in the countryside Codes used are listed in the preamble of main html For countries other than the USA the country name is given as well Alternatives for country names are space or xxx ocean Unknown is lc If the period of the film is significant it is given as T dd mmm yyyy notes Here a variety of notes is kept The preferred order is chronological as Book before Writer before Cost before Rating but this has not been entered consistently All entries have a FIELD IDENTIFIER designator as W writer R rating Fields as writers can have multiple entries separated by commas If an award is associated with an entry as an academy award for the writers of a movie it follows the name s after a semicolon For authors also music directors the title is specified as B author book title Alt T title reason lists alternate titles with a reason or date for the change if known There is a general Notes field Nt which mainly record firsts as first sound movie etc Er means possible error in the record to be checked sometime in the future from some source These note fields can be used to demonstrate the flexibility of object based structures but are best place in distinct fields in relational models Note entries SEEN and VT are private indicating when seen or have video tape information 3 2 The ACTORS Table There is one record for each actor listed but not all actors listed in CAST are documented There are also break and header records for each letter of the alphabet Col Name Description stagenm Stagename of the actor This is nearly the key of the table When an actor has used multiple names the last one used is preferred There are a few actors with identical names

information multiple records for each movie and listed actor There are no headers for distinct movies film id Identifier of the film All film ids used here appear in MOVIES and can be used as references title Title of the movie prefixed by T A prefix of TZ is used when he entry is uncertain as the actor s name The title field is actually redundant here because is also given in MOVIES with the film id It is used to reduce the the chances of errors and to reduce requirements for joins actor Name of the actor in this role always using the standardized stage name if the actor is listed in

Wiederhold<BR>\nLoaded into DB web files 25 September 1997.\nUpdated December 1998.\n<H2>This material was entered by \n<A HREF=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/people/gio.html\">Gio Wiederhold</A></H2>\nThe initial objective was as test data for students, to allow non-trivial\nexercises. There are fields suitable for complex joins, outerjoins, temporal\njoins, and recursion. It has also been used to investigate object-structured database technologies<P>\n\nThis is a HTML version of the description of the movies database.\nIt was based originally on the description from the Kamens and \nWiederhold temporal paper.\nIt also contains <A HREF=\"#REFS\">literature references</A> in appendix A.\n\n<H2>1.  Introduction</H2>\n    The database was used originally in implementing the temporal\nqueries in SQL is Wiederhold's movies database (see [21]) and for a\nnumber of other projects, both in Stanford classes and by research at\nthe Un.of Maryland and others..  The database allows testing of\ntheories about an implementation.  Since it contains \"real data\", it\nallowing checking of results for semantic as well as syntactic\ncorrectness.  Finally, the tables in the database consist of both\njournal and history relations (see 21, section 3), allowing us to test\nall of the different elements of an implementation. \n\n<P> The Overview section (2) below contains a summary of all the files\nand the URL pointers to them, or their parts or sections; see <A\nHREF=\"#Sec3\">Section 3</A> for a full schema description.\n\n<P> A number of the fields are unsuitable for relational implementation, because they contain sets of values.  These are best used in an object-capable implementation. The schema describes when such sets are to be expected.  Encodings for several of the fields are listed in <A HREF=\"#Sec4\">Section 4</A>..\n<P> At the end of this document, in Appendix B., are some conversion rules for\nconverting the HTML format to fields for relational or object databases.\n\n\n<H2>2.  Overview:</H2>\nThe central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier.  These identifiers may change in successive versions.  The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file.   More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file.  All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers.    A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other.  The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios show in MAIN.  This documentation file provides supplementary information, and is an essential part of the database. Some images are also available, but not on-line now. There are many cross-linking names throughout the files, so many in fact that web browsers have choked when trying to make them live.  Currently we simply try to be careful in naming films and people consistently.  More detail follows below.  Counts have been made using emacs `count-matches'.\n\n<H4>2.1 -- MOVIES  -- </H4> \nThe main movies file is\n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/main.html\">main.html</A>.\nIt contains 11435  `tr/td' table row entries (July 1999). \nIt is complete for Hitchcock movies and TV shows, \nand has most films that can be related  by topic, actors, director, history, and such to those films. \nIt has also many films corresponding to a variety of interests of mine, former students etc., \nwith an emphasis on historical value. \nMAIN is the \"central\" relation in the database; it is a journal relation that\ncontains  information about the movies  themselves.  The relation contains\ninformation about movies such as their titles, type, directors, and producers, as\nwell as their year of release.<BR>\nThere is also a subset file of 82\n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/mainH.html\">Hitchcock</A>\n full length Movies.  <BR>\n<BR>\n\n<H4>2.2 -- ACTORS  -- </H4> The file \n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/actors.html\">actors.html</A> has\n6813 `tr/td' table row entries (July.1999) for many of the actors appearing in CASTS.<BR>\nAlso <A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/actorsAH.html\">First part</A> and \n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/actorsIZ.html\">Second part </A>  of actors.html, not maintained. <BR>\nThe key of the relation is\n\"stagename\",  and there are intervals indicating the dates that the\nactor worked and the actor's lifetime.  Other information  in this relation is\nthe actor's real name, background, and the type of roles he/she typically \nplays. References to images are kept here too.\n\n<H4>2.3 -- DIRECTORS -- </H4> in file \n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/people.html\">people.html</A>\nThe file lists all directors, as well as some other movie people, as producers and cinematographers\n             (A total of 3290 `tr/td' table row entries, 3011 `@' directors as of July 1999). <BR>\nThe directors table is similar to the actors table in that it contains\nintervals for when the director worked and when he/she lived.  The key\nof the relation is the field \"name\", which is the name under which the\ndirector directed.  Director's key names do not contain any blanks.\nTypically the last name is used, when needed prefaced by an initial.\nA secondary unique key is defined for each director, up to three letters,\nbased on the initial letters of the first, middle, and last names.\nThis key will provide HTML HREF linkages among many of the files.\nAs with the actors table, this table also includes the real name of\nthe director among its fields (\"lastname\" and \"firstname\").  It also\ncontains importat producers, cinematographers, musicians and composers, etc.\n\n<H4>2.4 -- STUDIOS -- </H4> in file \n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/studios.html\">studios.html</A>\nare important studios only (203 `tr/td'  entries, sparse information).<BR>\nThe key of the studios relation is the name of the studio.  The temporal\ninformation that is included is an interval  indicating the years the\nstudio was (or is) in operation, represented by the fields  \"startdate\" and\n\"enddate\".  This is a history relation.\n\n<H4>2.5 -- CASTS -- </H4> in file \n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/casts.html\">casts.html</A>\nThis is a large (too large?) file of who acted as what in which movie.\n\t(46 009 tr/td entries, only partial for movies and roletypes, July 1999).\nCasts is an association relation, linking actors with movies.  The key of the\nrelation is the catenation of the two fields  \"film_id\" and \"actor\"; no\ntemporal information is included in this relation. <BR>\nThis file was  too big for Netscape in 1996, so that also\nfive working subsets were made available, however these are not kept up-to-date.<BR>\n<OL>\n<LI><A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/castsH.html\">casts of Hitchcock films</A>; <BR>\n<LI><A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/castsAB.html\">casts Part 1</A>, directors coded A-B; <BR>\n<LI><A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/castsCH.html\">casts Part 2</A>, directors coded C-H;<BR>\n<LI><A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/castsHO.html\">casts Part 3</A>, directors coded H-O;<BR>\n<LI><A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/castsPZ.html\">casts Part 4</A>, directors coded P-Z;<BR>\n</OL>\nThe four parts are still large files (6000-15000 entries; castsCH includes \nHitchcock films <BR>\n\n<H4>2.6 -- REMAKES  -- </H4> in file \n<A href=\"http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/movies/remakes.html\">remakes.html</A>\n(1278  `tr/td' entries in July 1999).<BR>\nThis table (which is not extensively used in the temporal DB paper) gives\ninformation about movies  that are remakes of other movies.  It is very \nuseful to test recursion in databases.\n\n<H4>2.7 -- SYNONYMS -- </H4> \nThis file has been superseded.

Schema Definition</A> for the Movies Database</H2>\n\nHere we give a detailed description of the schema of the movies\ndatabase, which is used for all examples in this paper and was used to\nimplement the temporal SQL additions.  General descriptions are given\nin Section 2, above.<BR>\n  This file is being updated to desctribe the HTML version. Where\nupdates were made, the old material is in curly {brackets}.\n\n\n<H4>3.1 The MOVIES Table</H4>\nCol-Name\t\t=  Description<BR>.\nThere is a distinct table for each director (Hitchcock has multiple tables,\none for early silent, one for British, one for American, and one for TV movies).<BR>\nThe tables are broken up p by year of first known film by the directors.  There are some\nbreak  and header records for each year.<BR> \nEach director table has two types of records:\n<OL>\n<LI> one header record for the director, with the director id, as shown in people,\nthe first year known for movies by that director, prefixed by an @ symbol, matching the\npeople entry, and the standard name for the director, also matching the people entry.<BR>\nThe remainder shows the format for the data records that follow below.. \nThe note field is often used to describe the set of detail records<BR>\nFor movies where the director in not known there is a dummy entry, either by topic (Unknown) or \nby year (UnYear), as shown in the people file.\n<LI> any number of records, one per film, formatted as shown below.\n</OL>\n\n\n<P>\n\nfilm_id\t=<UL><LI>  An internally generated id for the film.  This is the key of the\n\t   relation entries and is unique.

It is preceded by T: or Tn: (earlier also \\Tm,\\Tmm) depending on \n\t   the source of the data.  This field is not neccessarily unique.</UL>\n\nyear\t=<UL><LI>  Year the movie was released.  This is assumed to be an event (i.e. \n\t   to take zero time)</UL>\n\ndirector\t=<UL><LI>  Director of the movie, preceded by D:. \n\t   The standardized id-name is used. All directors must appear as  DIRECTORS \n                 in people.html, so that we have a proper reference constraint.  \n                 <LI>If there are multiple candidate directors the primary one or the one \n                 who finished the movie is chosen and other candidates are given in the \n\t  notes field as CoD().</UL>\n\nproducers=<UL><LI>  Producer(s) of the movie, preceded by P: if shown in\n\t   people.html and hence referencable by id_name . \n                 <LI>P: alone shows that there was no specific producer. \n                 <LI>If prefaced by PN: then the full name(s) is(/are) given; \n                 if prefaced by PZ: then the spelling is uncertain. \n\t   In both cases no reference to people can be expected.. \n\t   PN: is common, since only few id-names for producers\n\t   exist yet in the people.html files, except for producers who also \n\t   were DIRECTORS\n                 <LI>:PU alone means the producer is unknown to me. \n\t   <LI>Multiple producers are permitted and common.</UL>\n\nstudios\t=<UL><LI>  Studio(s) where the movie was filmed.

Multiple locations are separated \n \t   by semicolons (;), multiple levels in any location hierarchy are \n\t   separated by commas, as `high-school, csd, CA'; indicating movie\n\t   location is a California high-school in the countryside.  Codes used are\n\t   listed in the preamble of main.html.   For countries other than the\n\t   USA the country name is given as well.  Alternatives for country \n\t   names are `space' or `xxx ocean'.
