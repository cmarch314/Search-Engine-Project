Nevertheless, it is\r\nthis restrictiveness that allowed the developments of very useful concepts such\r\nas constraint propagation (also know as \"consistency enforcement\"), through\r\nwhich various tractable subclasses had emerged and by which general purpose\r\nalgorithms such as backtracking were improved [8,6,7,2]. However, real life\r\nproblems frequently call for extending the basic model to allow nondeterminism\r\nas the representation of preferences among solutions. Such extensions relate the\r\nCSP model to known models for combinatorial optimization developed in the\r\nOperation Research community as well as to more recent frameworks such as\r\nProbabilistic Networks [9]. \r\nIn this note I argue that extending the CSP model to a richer set of tasks can\r\nbe done elegantly using a unifying framework which I call \"bucket elimination\".\r\nI believe that this framework will allow hybrids of two fundamental problem\r\nsolving paradigms: elimination and conditioning, will address computational\r\nissues such as time-space tradeoffs, and will allow developing approximation\r\nalgorithms, all within this general, and therefore, widely applicable framework.\r\nIn the rest of this note I outline the basic framework.\r\n</div><br>\r\n\r\n<A href=\"R64.ps\">\r\n<img align=left border=\"0\" src=\"/~dechter/images/down.gif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[ps] </b></a>\r\n<A target=blank href=\"R64.pdf\">\r\n<b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <!--#include virtual=\"/~dechter/footer.html\" -->\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "id": 8633.0}
