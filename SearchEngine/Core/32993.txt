In Chimera, each hyperweb contains a set of anchors and links and provides access to the anchors and links stored in the hyperweb's parents. As the user moves between hyperwebs, the set of anchors and links available changes, thus establishing a different context for the connected Chimera clients.</p>\n\n<p>The Webs tab provides the operations required to select among the hyperwebs of a Chimera website. The names of the hyperwebs are displayed in the Webs list. \nThe image below shows a list with no member highlighted.</p>\n\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"../images/cs/cs_webs.gif\" WIDTH=\"490\" HEIGHT=\"270\"></CENTER>\n\n<H3>Hyperweb Names</H3>\n\n<p>All hyperwebs stored on the currently connected Chimera website are listed in the Webs list. Any name without a slash indicates a hyperweb at the top of the website's hierarchy. A hyperweb's children are indicated by separating the names with slashes. In the example below, <b>web1</b> is at the top of hierarchy along with <b>web2</b>, while <b>web1.1</b> and <b>web1.2</b> are the children of <b>web1</b>.</p>\n\n<H3>Operations</H3>\n\n<p>The Webs tab provides two operations: <B>Login</B> and <b>Logout</b>.</p>\n\n<H4>Login</H4>\n\n<p>To connect to a hyperweb, first click on its name within the list. \nThe hyperweb name will appear next to the enabled Login button.
