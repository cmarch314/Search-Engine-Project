setup that consisted of Two Fifth Dimension Technologies 5DT gloves one right and one left Two Ascension Flock of Birds magnetic position trackers one attached to each hand A four port serial card to cope with four data sources A PC 128MB RAM Intel Pentium II 266MHz was used In terms of the quality of the data the Flock system was far superior to the Nintendo system also available from the same donor Firstly this was a two hand system Secondly each position tracker provided 6 degrees of freedom i e roll pitch and yaw as well as x y and z The gloves also provided a full five fingers of data But the big improvements were in resolution both accuracy and temporal Position and orientation were defined to 14 bit accuracy giving position information with a typical positional error less than one centimetre and angle error less than one half of a degree Finger bend was measured with 8 bits per finger of which probably 6 bits were usable once the glove was calibrated The refresh rate of the complete system was close to 1 frames per second and all signals had significantly less noise than the Nintendo data Samples from a single signer a native Auslan signer were collected over a period of nine weeks In total 27 samples per sign and a total of 2565 signs were collected The average length of each sign was approximately 57 frames See past usage for a more detailed discussion on the data collection methodology Signers The data was collected from a volunteer native Auslan signer Preprocessing The data presented is the raw data with no filtering Variable Descriptions The following data were recorded for each hand x position expressed relative to a zero point set slightly below the chin Expressed in meters y position expressed relative to a zero point set slightly below the chin Expressed in meters z position expressed relative to a zero point set slightly below the chin Expressed in meters roll expressed as a value between 5 and 5 with being palm down Positive means the palm is rolled clockwise from the perspective of the signer To get degrees multiply by 18 pitch expressed as a value between 5 and 5 with being palm flat horizontal Positive means the palm is pointing up To get degrees multiply by 18 yaw expressed a value between 1 and 1 with being palm straight ahead from the perspective of the signer Positive means clockwise from the perspective above the signer To get degrees multiply by 18 Thumb bend measure between and 1 means totally flat 1 means totally bent However the finger bend measurements are not very exact Forefinger bend measure between and 1 means totally flat 1 means totally bent However the finger bend measurements are not very exact Middle finger bend measure between and 1 means totally flat 1 means totally bent However the finger bend measurements are not very exact Ring finger bend measure between and 1 means totally flat 1 means totally bent However the finger bend measurements are not very exact Little finger bend measure between and 1 means totally flat 1 means totally bent However the finger bend measurements are not very exact Data Format The file consists of 9 subdirectories tctodd1 9 Each directory consists of 3 samples of each sign captured on a different day In total there are 95 different signs with 27 samples per sign Signs were provided by a native signer volunteer Each file consists of a sequence of
