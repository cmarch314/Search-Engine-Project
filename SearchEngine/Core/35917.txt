First, I\ufffdll give a review of collaborative authoring scenarios and features in the word processing arena. Right now the leading workgroup word processors have a fairly rich feature set for collaborative authoring that\ufffds quite unmatched by anything in the Web authoring area. At first thought that might seem to give us some short-term advantage in a battle over file formats. But what we really want to do is take what we\ufffdve already learned through years of studying users in workgroup scenarios, and apply that to the Web. For examples, I\ufffdll focus on Word 7.0, which actually has the same collaborative authoring feature set as Word 6.0. Just to be fair, though, I\ufffdll mention some interesting work that Lotus has done on Word Pro 96.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>Second, I\ufffdll give a very high-level overview of Word\ufffds future plans in collaborative authoring. Unfortunately I can\ufffdt give you too many specifics about Word 8, which is coming out this fall. But I\ufffdll try to tell you what I can.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>Next, I\ufffdll talk about some of the issues we\ufffdll need to answer in order to have a collaborative authoring Web feature set based on open standards.</P>\n\n<P> </P> \n</Body>\n</HTML>", "id": 35917.0}
