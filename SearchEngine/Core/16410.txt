{"text": "Euler s Formula Proof 1 Pick s Theorem We have translated our sum of angles proof to spherical trigonometry in the process obtaining formulas in terms of sums of areas of faces Now we examine similar formulas for sums of areas in planar geometry following a suggestion of Wells The basic tool here is Pick s Theorem in any polygon P drawn so that it s vertices are on points x y where x and y are both integers the area of P can be expressed as N B 2 1 where N is the number of integer interior points and B is the number of integer points on the edges and vertices of P This can be proven in a number of ways for instance by choosing a horizontal line L passing below the polygon and partitioning the polygon s area into the sum of signed areas of trapezoids from L to each edge These proofs do not require Euler s formula so there is no danger of circular reasoning First draw the planar graph corresponding to the polygon with straight line segment edges It is possible to choose a sufficiently small radius r such that if we move each vertex somewhere within a circle of that radius centered on its original location the resulting graph will remain planar scale the graph so that r 1 Then move every vertex to the nearest integer vertex the result is an equivalent planar graph drawn in the grid The outer face of the graph is covered exactly once by the remaining faces so the sum of the areas of the remaining faces should equal the area of the outer faces This sum of areas is by Pick s Theorem I X B 2 S 2 F 1 where I is the number of points interior to one of the faces X is the number of points on an interior edge each of which counts 1 2 in each of two faces S is the sum over all vertices of the number of interior faces the vertex belongs to and the F 1 term comes from adding the 1 term in each of F 1 applications of Pick s theorem A vertex interior to the graph contributes a term to S equal to its degree whereas a vertex on the outer face contributes only its degree minus one Therefore S 2E K where K is the number of vertices on the outer face Further by Pick s Theorem the area of the outer face is I X V K B K 2 1 Combining the two equations S 2E K and I X B 2 S 2 F 1 I X V K B K 2 1 yields the result Unfortunately Pick s theorem does not generalize to higher dimensions so this approach seems unlikely to work for proving higher dimensional forms of Euler s formula Proofs of Euler s Formula From the Geometry Junkyard computational and recreational geometry pointers David Eppstein Theory Group ICS UC Irvine Semi automatically filtered from a common source file Last update ", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/pick.html", "title": "euler's formula", "html": "<html><head>\n<title>Euler's Formula</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/\"><img src=\"../junkyard.gif\" align=center width=\"545\" height=\"45\" alt=\"The Geometry Junkyard\" border=0></a></h1>\n<hr>\n<h1>Euler's Formula,\nProof 10: Pick's Theorem\n</H1>\n\n\nWe have translated our\n<a href=\"angle.html\">sum-of-angles proof</a> to \n<a href=\"sphere.html\">spherical trigonometry</a>, in the process\nobtaining formulas in terms of sums of areas of faces.\nNow we examine similar formulas for sums of areas in planar geometry,\nfollowing a suggestion of\n<a href=\"refs.html#Wells\">Wells</a>.\n\n<P>\nThe basic tool here is <a href=\"http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Stomachion/Pick.html\">Pick's Theorem</a>:\nin any polygon P drawn so that it's vertices are on points (x,y)\nwhere x and y are both integers, the area of P can be expressed\nas N + B/2 - 1, where N is the number of integer interior points, \nand B is the number of integer points on the edges and vertices of P.\nThis can be proven in a number of ways, for instance by choosing\na horizontal line L passing below the polygon and partitioning the polygon's area\ninto the sum of signed areas of trapezoids from L\nto each edge.  These proofs do not require Euler's formula so there is\nno danger of circular reasoning.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nFirst draw the planar graph corresponding to the polygon, with straight\nline segment edges.  It is possible to choose a sufficiently small\nradius r, such that if we move each vertex somewhere within a circle of\nthat radius centered on its original location, the resulting graph will\nremain planar; scale the graph so that r=1.\nThen move every vertex to the nearest integer vertex; the result is an\nequivalent planar graph drawn in the grid.\n<P>\nThe outer face of the graph is covered exactly once by the remaining faces,\nso the sum of the areas of the remaining faces should equal the area of\nthe outer faces.  This sum of areas is, by Pick's Theorem,\nI+X+B/2+S/2-(F-1), where I is the number of points interior to one of the faces,\nX is the number of points on an interior edge (each of which counts 1/2\nin each of two faces), S is the sum (over all vertices) of the number of\ninterior faces the vertex belongs to, and the (F-1) term comes from\nadding the -1 term in each of F-1 applications of Pick's theorem.\n<P>\nA vertex interior to the graph contributes a term to S equal to its degree,\nwhereas a vertex on the outer face contributes only its degree minus one.\nTherefore S=2E-K where K is the number of vertices on the outer face.\nFurther, by Pick's Theorem, the area of the outer face is\n(I+X+V-K)+(B+K)/2-1.\nCombining the two equations S=2E-K and\nI+X+B/2+S/2-(F-1)=(I+X+V-K)+(B+K)/2-1 yields the result.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P>Unfortunately <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/pick3d.html\">Pick's theorem\ndoes not generalize</a> to higher dimensions, so this approach seems\nunlikely to work for proving higher-dimensional forms of Euler's formula.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "id": 16410.0}
