Informatics focuses on understanding the effect of information technology on people, studying computer systems in their real-world context, and determining how those systems can work effectively.\r\n<P>\r\nStudents with an affinity for design and an interest in learning how to develop effective and usable software systems are encouraged to explore this major.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"expandable\" STYLE=\"margin-top: 2em; \">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P CLASS=\"section_heading\"><A HREF=\"#\">IS INFORMATICS FOR ME?</A> <span></span> </P>\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"section_content\">\r\n<P>\r\nThe Informatics degree program offers a contemporary curriculum with an emphasis on group work (starting with the first course), studio-oriented design courses and a yearlong senior project. \r\n\r\n<P>\r\nYou may want to consider this major if you:\r\n<UL class=\"content-list-large\">\r\n   <LI>enjoy solving problems using all the tools you have available;\r\n   <LI>can work not only with technical details but also with \u201cbig-picture\u201d issues; \r\n   <LI>have strong reading and writing skills and can think freely, creatively and systematically.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\nPrevious experience in computer programming is not required to start the Informatics major. Programming is just one aspect of Informatics, and the major introduces all the necessary skills at a manageable pace. Students who already have some programming experience will also find new concepts, even in the very first course. \r\n<P>\r\nThe first year of the program provides students with a hands-on introduction to the broad field of Informatics, centering on the Informatics Core Course. This yearlong course develops students\u2019 basic understanding of software: how to design and construct programs, and how the programs operate as part of information technology systems.\r\n<P>\r\nThe second year builds up a portfolio of foundational concepts and techniques that establish the discipline of Informatics; these contribute to the \u201ctoolbox\u201d students will use in subsequent years to solve large-scale information and software design problems. As sophomores, students begin to take more advanced courses that support their specialization in either software engineering, human-computer interaction, or the study of organizations and information technology. These may involve courses in Management, Psychology, Computer Science or Engineering.\r\n<P>\r\nIn the third year, all students study the design process, project management and the impacts of technology on the real world. Students continue to take electives in their specialized area of study.\r\n<P>\r\nThe fourth year is built around a yearlong capstone project in which groups of students tackle a significant assignment, typically from an outside client.\r\n\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"clear\"></DIV>\r\n</DIV>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P CLASS=\"section_heading\"><a href=\"#\">WHAT COURSES DO I TAKE?</A> <span></span> </P>\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"section_content\">\r\n<P>\r\nCurrent requirements for this major can be found in the <A HREF=\"http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofinformatics/\">General Catalogue</A>.\r\n\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"clear\"></DIV>\r\n\r\n</DIV>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P CLASS=\"section_heading\"><a href=\"#\">WHAT CAN I DO WITH A DEGREE IN INFORMATICS?</A> <span></span> </P>\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"section_content\">\r\n<P>\r\nA degree in Informatics provides excellent preparation for a career at the forefront of the computing industry. \r\n<P>\r\nOur graduates work in many industrial settings \u2014 ranging from start-up companies and small software houses to consulting firms and multinational corporations \u2014 in various roles, including:\r\n<UL class=\"content-list-large\">\r\n   <LI>Software Engineer </LI>\r\n   <LI>Human-Computer Interface Designer </LI>\r\n   <LI>Information Architect </LI>\r\n   <LI>Game Designer </LI>\r\n   <LI>Usability Engineer </LI>\r\n   <LI>Mobile Computing Systems Designer </LI>\r\n</UL>\r\n<P STYLE=\"clear: both; \">\r\nMany also go on to graduate school to pursue an advanced degree in computer engineering, computer science, information science, management or law. \r\n\r\n<DIV CLASS=\"clear\"></DIV>\r\n</DIV>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</DIV>  <!-- #expandable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n            <p class=\"image-fig\">\r\n                <img src=\"/prospective/img/degrees-informatics-img.png\" alt=\"Informatics students demonstrate a prototype of their senior project \u2014 an interactive comic book app that teaches English to Japanese school-age children.\" />\r\n                <cite STYLE=\"display: block; width: 434px; \">Informatics students demonstrate a prototype of their senior project \u2014 an interactive comic book app that teaches English to Japanese school-age children. </cite>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style \">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pubid=xa-4d7e35ad5fb0fe07\" class=\"addthis_button_compact\">Share</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"addthis_separator\">|</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_1\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_2\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_3\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"addthis_button_preferred_4\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">var addthis_config = { ui_language: 'en' };</script>\r\n\t\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=xa-4d7e35ad5fb0fe07\"></script>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div id=\"footer\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lang-selector\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Language: </strong>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/en/degrees/informatics/\" class=\"active\">English</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/zh-tw/degrees/informatics/\" class=\"\">Chinese (Traditional)</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/ko/degrees/informatics/\" class=\"\">Korean</a> |\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/prospective/vi/degrees/informatics/\" class=\"\">Vietnamese</a>\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"footer-left\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t    <p>University of California, Irvine - Irvine, CA 92697 : 949-824-5011</p>\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"links\">\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/comments.php\" target=\"_blank\">Comments & Questions</a> |\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/privacy.php\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy & Legal Notice</a> |\r\n                    <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\" target=\"_blank\">Copyright Inquiries</a> |\r\n                    &copy; 2015 UC Regents\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"footer-right\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.crispbrandagency.com/\" class=\"crisp image-text\" target=\"_blank\">Site By Crisp</a>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "id": 7870.0}
