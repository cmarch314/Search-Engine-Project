outlawed by NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them Michael Jordan would wear the shoes anyway and each time he stepped on the court with the Air Jordan 1 he would be fined five thousand dollars Nike used this as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities Nike would later create a colorway with red white and black which would be worn by Jordan for most of the 1985 and 1986 season The success of the Air Jordan 1 encouraged Nike to

look The Air Jordan III was also famous for the humorous ads depicting Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon the character he played in his film She s Gotta Have It This campaign was known as the Mars and Mike

solutions to the last HW 22 February 2 9 12 42 If we want to submit HW4 electronically should we use the Hwk2 AssignmentSubmission dropbox on EEE or will a new one be created Or should HW4 only be turned in during class Thank you Sorry I ve created a HW4 drop box if you need it However if you could also turn in a hard copy in class of anything except code I d appreciate it Mitch 17 February 2 9 16 52 Hi Ben You can refer to last quarter s slides while waiting for slides for this class I mean CS271 in fall 2 8 offered by prof Dechter Actually the contents are almost identical Yes my slides are based on slides from previous versions of 271 and those slides can be used if you don t want to wait for mine Ben 12 February 2 9 12 41 Wonder how long it ll take to get lecture slides posted Bad bad bad I don t see that waiting one day to get slides is such a big deal How many people have started the homework Vikram 4 February 2 9 17 45 I am sorry my previous post mean the textbook defines Quiescence as what the slides define as the Horizon effect Vikram 4 February 2 9 17 44 It seems like the textbook defines Quiescence as what the slides have defined Pg 2 2 in the Second edition of the textbook And I don t quite get what the textbook defines as the horizon effect if it is any different at all Is my understanding correct Good question Quiescence is a measure of how strong the horizon effect will be quiescent nodes will not suffer from a strong short term horizon effect So the horizon effect is the notion that there is a distance beyond which the algorithm cannot see and quiescence is a property of a node that if we look only a little further our evaluation function will not change dramatically Nate 4 February 2 9 16 7 Does the min conflicts algorithm always terminate I remember how hill climbing greedily picked a next solution and could get stuck in a local maximum It seems that min conflicts could infinitely loop trying and moving variables without reaching a solution Or are there bounds to the number of attempts Not always it can become stuck and terminate at a non solution or can move randomly around a plateau But it is effective with surprising frequency Mitch 3 February 2 9 19 53 I think we all need the solution to homework 2 before the midterm Could you upload the solution Done anonymous 2 February 2 9 8 45 For Problem 2 on Homework 2 what did you mean by for compactness write each node as abc def ghi Did you mean draw a search tree and nodes in the tree should appear as letters rather than explicit 3x3 states of the 8 puzzle I simply meant that rather than drawing an entire 8 puzzle square you can just write each configuration in order say left to right and top to bottom If you want to draw the entire square that s OK too Rohit 24 January 2 9 12 26 It would be helpful if you can put up the midterm course online Thanks I m not quite sure what this means Mitch 22 January 2 9 13 1 At least could you upload lecture slides within the day we have a

The shoes informally referred to in the plural as Jordan's or simply J's, were first produced for Michael Jordan in 1984 and released for public consumption in 2001.|Since its introduction into the sports shoe market, the Air Jordan evolved to the original basketball shoes to models for different uses, including I-XXIII.. Air Jordan currently sponsors 21 active NBA players, including Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Ray Allen, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony. They also endorse Nike Air Jordan products. Also they sponsor other sports such as the MLB, NFL, NASCAR, Track, and the WNBA.|The Air Jordan 1 was designed by Peter Moore. The Air Jordan 1 was first produced for Michael Jordan in 1983, in a red and black colorway to match the uniform of the Chicago Bulls, the team for which Michael Jordan played. This red and black color-way was later outlawed by NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them. Michael Jordan would wear the shoes anyway, and each time he stepped on the court with the Air Jordan 1 he would be fined five thousand dollars. Nike used this as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities. Nike would later create a colorway with red, white, and black which would be worn by Jordan for most of the 1985 and 1986 season.|The success of the Air Jordan 1 encouraged Nike to release the New Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was made in Italy giving the shoe a luxury feel. The Air Jordan II was originally retailed at $100.|The Air Jordan III was designed by Tinker Hatfield who works by nike as a designer for stores and offices. By that time Michael Jordan was ready to leave Nike, but the Jordan III changed his mind. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new Jumpman logo, an elephant print trim and tumble leather to give it a luxury look. The Air Jordan III was also famous for the humorous ads depicting Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the character he played in his film 'She's Gotta Have It'. This campaign was known as the \"Mars and Mike\" ad campaign, which was one of Nike's most successful advertisement campaigns. These were the first Jordan's to feature the \"NIKE AIR\" logo on the back, but later replaced by the Jumpman logo, with the words \"AIR\" underneath it, similar to the Air Jordan VI. These were said to be Michael Jordan's favorite shoes, he wore them during the 1988 Dunk Championship and many other event\n</p></div>\n<p class='vspace'><a name='comment222' id='comment222'></a>\n</p><div class='messagehead' > \n<h5>Traffic racing  &mdash;  <span style='font-size:83%'>18 December 2014, 17:29</span>  </h5>\n</div><div class='messageitem' > \n<p>Drive as many auto as you can imagine and race in this infinite traffic racer fun.

And I don't quite get what the textbook defines as the horizon effect if it is any different at all. Is my understanding correct?\n<br clear='all' /><span  style='color: green;'> Good question.  Quiescence is a measure of how strong the horizon effect will be -- quiescent nodes will not suffer from a strong (short term) horizon effect.  So the horizon effect is the notion that there is a distance beyond which the algorithm cannot \"see\", and quiescence is a property of a node that if we look only a little further our evaluation function will not change dramatically.</span>\n</p></div>\n<p class='vspace'><a name='comment9' id='comment9'></a>\n</p><div class='messagehead' > \n<h5>Nate  &mdash;  <span style='font-size:83%'>04 February 2009, 16:07</span>  </h5>\n</div><div class='messageitem' > \n<p>Does the min-conflicts algorithm always terminate?
