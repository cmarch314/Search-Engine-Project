Xie and Chen Li have been awarded a three year grant of nearly 662 from the National Institutes of Health NIH to develop new computational tools essential for future advances in sequencing human genomes DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research understanding disease mechanisms and the development of new increasingly personalized treatments Current sequencing of an individual s genome is done by extracting short segments of DNA randomly sampling those segments and then assembling the hundreds of millions or even hundreds of billions of pieces into a whole genome which remains a costly undertaking Next generation sequencing NGS techniques which enable the rapid generation of billions of bases of genes at relatively low cost pose a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately Although a number of computational tools have been developed to address this problem they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat duplicated and other so called unmappable regions of genomes says Xie The primary goal of his NIH funded research is to develop computational algorithms and open source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of NGS analysis tools and expand the accessibility of those tools to previously understudied regions This will create a new way of mapping the sequencing to the reference genome identifying all mapping locations instead of one or only a few That will be followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads UCI computer scientists on the project are collaborating with biologists developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems including Timothy Osborne of Sanford Burnham Medical Research Institute Kyoko Yokomori of the UCI School of Medicine and Ken Cho of UCI s School of Biological Sciences The UCI team s work to reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of sequencing ultimately may make it possible to create an individual patient s genome as part of a routine diagnostic procedure Meenakshisundaram

computer graphics geometry processing image processing and multimedia Enhancing privacy in embedded systems Tsudik receives grant from Bosch Gene Tsudik Bosch Research and Technology Center has awarded computer science professor Gene Tsudik 5 to support his efforts to enhance privacy in embedded systems This grant represents the first partnership between Bosch and UC Irvine The term embedded systems refers to systems that control specific functions within a larger structure Embedded systems help control everything from pacemakers security systems and cell phones to planes trains and automobiles Used by the billions in countless applications these systems have become essential to daily life As long as they operate safely and effectively most of us never even think about them Tsudik who also directs the Secure Computing and Networking Center SCONCE at UCI continuously explores ways to increase the security of such systems Bosch Research and Technology Center the research arm of one of the world s leading manufacturers of appliances automotive components security systems medical equipment and many other devices dependent on embedded systems sought Tsudik s collaboration in research on embedded systems security As more devices use embedded systems and as these systems increasingly communicate with other equipment privacy becomes even more challenging and essential Communication between embedded systems is like opening a new door Tsudik observes Once that door is open you never know who or what might come in Through his collaboration with Bosch and his ongoing research Tsudik seeks to improve security and to maintain integrity of embedded devices in the most efficient manner Li Mehrotra receive DASFAA 1 year Best Paper Award Chen Li SharadMehrotra

awards 5 K grant to Welling Shahbaba MaxWelling BabakShahbaba The National Science Foundation has awarded computer science professor Max Welling and assistant professor of statistics Babak Shahbaba 5 to fund the project Efficient Bayesian Learning from Stochastic Gradients Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC is a technique that allows one to draw representative samples from almost any probability distribution While the MCMC technology has revolutionized the usefulness of Bayesian statistics over the last few decades it has not been able to scale well to today s very large data problems Welling and Shahbaba will examine a new family of MCMC procedures that requires only a few hundred data cases per update We believe this new class of methods will for the first time unlock the full strength of Bayesian methods for very large datasets stated Welling and Shahbaba in their NSF proposal Due to their highly practical nature the techniques developed under this grant are likely to gain widespread acceptance across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines as well as in industry The grant will enable UC Irvine students to collaborate with students and postdocs from the University of

help support the work of computer science professor Gene Tsudik in making the next generation Internet more secure An expert in computer security and privacy Tsudik leads a team that is exploring security advantages and strengthening potential weaknesses of Named Data Networking NDN in preventing denial of service DoS attacks Such attacks disable their victims by overloading them with communications from zombies or bots that is computers that have already been compromised by hackers for malicious purposes NDN aims to replace the current Internet Protocol IP Rather than the IP method of assigning names to computers and addresses to their network interfaces NDN names the content that travels through the network To provide trust in communicated information each piece of named content must be signed by its producer The current IP based Internet allows anyone to talk to any entity such as a computer or a router This opens the door for DoS and attack types And attacks are not the only problem with today s Internet Tsudik says the Internet s decades old architecture was not designed for the kind of communication that takes place over it today web traffic and rich multimedia communication It was primarily designed for email and remote terminal access In other words the Internet is not just threatened by hackers and other miscreants it is also a victim of its own popularity Billions of people use it intensively and cracks are starting to show Tsudik is one of a number of experts from dozens of institutions who answered the call from the National Science Foundation to construct a more resilient future Internet architecture To make that next incarnation safer from attacks such as DoS Tsudik and his group at UCI are collaborating with colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center where the security team is lead by Ersin Uzun a former Ph D student of Tsudik s and UCLA They are also jointly exploring privacy protection techniques for NDN Patterson

Current sequencing of an individual&#8217;s genome is done by extracting short segments of DNA, randomly sampling those segments and then assembling the hundreds of millions, or even hundreds of billions, of pieces into a whole genome, which remains a costly undertaking. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, which enable the rapid generation of billions of bases of genes at relatively low cost, pose a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. \n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;Although a number of computational tools have been developed to address this problem, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes,&#8221; says Xie. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe primary goal of his NIH-funded research is to develop computational algorithms and open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of NGS analysis tools and expand the accessibility of those tools to previously understudied regions. This will create a new way of mapping the sequencing to the reference genome, identifying all mapping locations instead of one or only a few. That will be followed by a machine-learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads.\n</p>\n<p>\nUCI computer scientists on the project are collaborating with biologists developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems, including Timothy Osborne of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Kyoko Yokomori of the UCI School of Medicine and Ken Cho of UCI&#8217;s School of Biological Sciences. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe UCI team&#8217;s work to reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of sequencing ultimately may make it possible to create an individual patient&#8217;s genome as part of a routine diagnostic procedure. \n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<p><b><a name=\"winter_2013_meenakshisundaram_mukherjee_receive_best_paper_award_at_icvgip_2012\"></a>Meenakshisundaram, Mukherjee receive best paper award at ICVGIP 2012</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\">\n<div align=\"CENTER\">\n      <img alt=\"photo: Gopi Meenakshisundaram \" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/gopi.jpg\" style=\"margin: auto auto;\"/>\n<p><b> Gopi <br/> Meenakshisundaram </b></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Uddipan Mukherjee\" height=\"90px\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/noteworthy/UddipanMukherjee-noteworthy.jpg\" style=\"height: 90px;\"/>\n<p><b> Uddipan <br/> Mukherjee </b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\n&#8220;<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7egopi/SamplePubs/Tweening.pdf\">Tweening Boundary Curves of Non-Simple Immersions of a Disk</a>,&#8221; by associate professor of computer science \n<strong>Gopi Meenakshisundaram</strong> \nand Ph.D. student \n<strong>Uddipan Mukherjee</strong>, \nwon the sole best paper award at the eighth Indian Conference of Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (<a href=\"http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/graphics/icvgip2012/\">ICVGIP</a>) held in Mumbai, India. \n</p>\n<p>\nTweening, also known as shape morphing, is an important concept in keyframe animation wherein an initial shape is transformed smoothly into a final shape.

Bosch Research and Technology Center &#8212; the research arm of one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of appliances, automotive components, security systems, medical equipment and many other devices dependent on embedded systems &#8212; sought Tsudik&#8217;s collaboration in research on embedded systems security.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs more devices use embedded systems, and as these systems increasingly communicate with other equipment, privacy becomes even more challenging and essential. &#8220;Communication between embedded systems is like opening a new door,&#8221; Tsudik observes. &#8220;Once that door is open, you never know who &#8212; or what &#8212; might come in.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nThrough his collaboration with Bosch and his ongoing research, Tsudik seeks to improve security and to maintain integrity of embedded devices in the most efficient manner. \n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n\n<hr/>\n<p><b><a name=\"winter_2013_li_mehrotra_receive_dasfaa_10_year_best_paper_award\"></a>Li, Mehrotra receive DASFAA 10-year Best Paper Award</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Chen Li \" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/noteworthy/chenli-noteworthy.jpg\" style=\"height: 90px;\"/>\n<p><b>Chen <br/> Li</b></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"Sharad Mehrotra\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/sharad.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b>Sharad<br/>Mehrotra </b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nComputer science professors <strong>Chen Li</strong> and <strong>Sharad Mehrotra</strong> have won the 2013 DASFAA 10-year Best Paper Award, to be presented by the Database Systems for Advanced Applications at its 18th international conference.

An expert in computer security and privacy, Tsudik leads a team that is exploring security advantages and strengthening potential weaknesses of Named-Data Networking (NDN) in preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Such attacks disable their victims by overloading them with communications from &#8220;zombies&#8221; or &#8220;bots&#8221; &#8212; that is, computers that have already been compromised by hackers for malicious purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\nNDN aims to replace the current Internet Protocol (IP). Rather than the IP method of assigning names to computers and addresses to their network interfaces, NDN names the content that travels through the network. To provide trust in communicated information, each piece of named content must be signed by its producer.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe current IP-based Internet allows anyone to &#8220;talk&#8221; to any entity, such as a computer or a router. This opens the door for DoS and attack types. And attacks are not the only problem with today&#8217;s Internet. Tsudik says the Internet&#8217;s decades-old architecture &#8220;was not designed for the kind of communication that takes place over it today: web traffic and rich multimedia communication. It was primarily designed for email and remote terminal access.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nIn other words, the Internet is not just threatened by hackers and other miscreants; it is also a victim of its own popularity. Billions of people use it intensively, and cracks are starting to show.\n</p>\n<p>\nTsudik is one of a number of experts from dozens of institutions who answered the call from the National Science Foundation to construct a more resilient future Internet architecture. To make that next incarnation safer from attacks (such as DoS), Tsudik and his group at UCI are collaborating with colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center &#8212; where the security team is lead by Ersin Uzun, a former Ph.D. student of Tsudik&#8217;s &#8212; and UCLA.
