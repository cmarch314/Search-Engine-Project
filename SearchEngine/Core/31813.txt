Sciences Attendance Students are responsible for material that is disseminated during class If you miss class please arrange beforehand with a friend to get notes handouts for you If you know you are going to miss something important contact the instructor beforehand It s much easier to accommodate planned absences Students are responsible for all material taught in this course If you join the class later in the quarter you are expected to complete all missed work immediately Attendance is part of your grade Announcements Announcements will be emailed to your UCI Net ID Login through an EEE managed class mailing list Please make sure it is set up properly and being forwarded to whichever account you normally read email from Make sure it is not on your spam list or being filtered as junk mail Many other announcements will be made in class as well An email has been sent to the class mailing list If you did not receive it please investigate the problem so that you do not miss required information Email correspondence to instructors To make sure that the class staff see your email please include the class code INF 241 at the beginning of the subject line If you do not get a response to the email in 24 hours except weekends please resend it or talk to me after class I recommend also cc ing the EEE class mailing list on non personal issues so that the entire class benefits from the discussion Late Penalty The late penalty is 1 per hour after the due date Due dates are specified with a date and time in local time For example if an assignment s due date is 11 59pm on Monday night and it is turned in on 11 59pm Tuesday night it is 24 hours late will be result in a 24 penalty Sick Policy If you find that you are unable to make it to a scheduled event class exam presentation etc due to sickness please get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class In the absence of such documentation please contact the staff as soon as you realize that you are going to miss a scheduled event Generally sicknesses will be treated on a case by case basis We will accommodate you as best as we can depending on the circumstances Add Drop Electronic Add Drop only Standard University time lines apply I choose to not waive prerequisites Incompletes I will only offer an incomplete grade to a student who through some unforeseen emergency is unable to complete the requirements of the course Academic honesty Please familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy http www editor uci edu catalogue appx appx 2 htm In a nutshell you may never use anyone else s work without clearly acknowledging the source This includes code you find on the web text from books and answers from friends If an assignment requires you to do the work yourself then acknowledging the source of an answer does not fulfill the requirements of the assignment Plagiarism is any work that you use that you did not create and do not credit The ACM publishes a more detailed definition here If you plagiarize another work without crediting the source you will receive a failing grade for the entire course at the discretion of the instructor This has happened in my courses before it has happened in conferences that I have chaired and I have sat in conferences in which others have presented my work verbatim In each of these cases I took the harshest possible recourse available to me at the time Our global academic system relies on properly creditting sources for everything to function I have kicked students out of UCI for cheating in my courses It takes 2 seconds to cite your source If you want to be intellectually lazy do something else with your life Web Page Readings and Assignments The web page for the class is subject to update Check it frequently and be sure to refresh reload the web pages when you browse them Please follow the assignments exactly If you need clarification ask before the assignment is due Students with Disabilities or Special Needs Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability religious observance or anything else should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs If appropriate contact the Disability Services Center at 949 824 7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion Donald J Patterson 2 12", "_id": "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2012_09_INF241/admin.html", "title": "informatics 241: introduction to ubiquitous computing",
