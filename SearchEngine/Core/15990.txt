Given such a tour, let R denote the number of times\nthe tour reaches a vertex that has already been seen earlier in the\ntour. For instance, this repetition count would equal one for a graph in\nthe form of a single cycle: only the starting vertex is repeated. As Red\nBurton observed, it is always the case that\nF&nbsp;=&nbsp;R+&nbsp;1. For, if one draws the edges of the graph in the\norder given by the tour, then the drawing starts out with one face, and\nevery repeated vertex closes off one more face. But we also have\nR&nbsp;=&nbsp;E&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;V&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, because there are\nE&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 vertices visited in the tour from start to end, of which\nV are not repetitions. Putting these two equations for R together and\neliminating R gives\nEuler's formula, but only for Eulerian graphs.</p>\n\n<p>Now, given an arbitrary planar graph G, draw two\nparallel copies of each edge, separated by a thin two-sided face. This\nmodification doesn't change the value of the formula\nV&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;E&nbsp;+&nbsp;F for graph G, because it adds the\nsame quantity (E) to both the number of edges and the number of faces,\nwhich cancel each other in the formula. But the new graph is Eulerian,\nso the repetition count argument for Eulerian graphs applies to it, and\nshows that in it E&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;V&nbsp;+&nbsp;F&nbsp=&nbsp;2.\nThe same must be true in the original graph.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of proving Euler's formula by transforming an arbitrary\nplanar graph to make it\nEulerian was found by University of Houston chemical engineering\nsophomore Stephanie Mathew, under the supervision of Siemion Fajtlowicz,\nwho used this idea to find the above proof. Fajtlowicz also supplies two\ndifferent variants of the proof, in which one repeatedly connects pairs\nof odd vertices either by an arc in the plane that avoids all the\nexisting vertices or by by doubling paths in the given graph. Both of\nthese alternative versions of the Euler tour proof use the fact that\nevery graph has an even number of odd vertices, which was proven by\nEuler.</p>\n\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "id": 15990.0}
