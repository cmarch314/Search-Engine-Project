{"text": "Lattice Theory and Geometry of Numbers Informally a lattice is an infinite arrangement of points spaced with sufficient regularity that one can shift any point onto any other point by some symmetry of the arrangement More formally a lattice can be defined as a discrete subgroup of a finite dimensional vector space the subgroup is often required not to lie within any subspace of the vector space which can be expressed formally by saying that the quotient of the space by the lattice is compact The simplest and most commonly studied example of a lattice the integer grid is formed by the points all Cartesian coordinates of which are integers Other types of lattices arise in crystallography and in sphere packing where they are used to describe the locations of atoms or spheres
