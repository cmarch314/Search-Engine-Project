Below are the following steps you need to take to get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"font-size: 22px;\">\r\n  <li> Log in to cloud party at <a href=\"https://its.cloudpartytime.com/#-3,2,0.1,0_2180\">https://its.cloudpartytime.com/#-3,2,0.1,0_2180</a> </li>\r\n  <li> Browse through the following resources:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li> <a href=\"https://wiki.cloudpartytime.com/wiki/Getting_Started\">Getting started</a> </li>\r\n      <li> <a href=\"https://wiki.cloudpartytime.com/wiki/Building\">Building</a> </li>\r\n      <li> <a href=\"https://wiki.cloudpartytime.com/wiki/Scripting\">Scripting</a> </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <li> Meet us on the island and \"Friend\" us so we can give you editing permissions. If you did not make the time set aside in class, send us a mail to arrange a time. </li>\r\n  <li> Choose a project idea.\r\n  <li> Design a coarse, low-polygon 3D model in Maya that captures your attraction. A sample coarse model for a Ferris Wheel is above. If your carnival attraction requires many small models, create a few and position them so that they occupy the amount of space you expect your attraction to take.\r\n  <li> Export this model from Maya in Collada DAE format, with the goal of uploading to Cloud Party. Note that Cloud Party units are in meters, while Maya defaults to centimeters. Cloud Party also defaults to the Z-axis pointing up, while Maya defaults to the Y-axis pointing up. Both these options can be set in the Collada DAE exporter in Maya before exporting the mesh.\r\n  <li> Upload your model to Zotlandia, and place it on a wooden platform. Scale down your model to fit on a platform (as shown above). We will use this as a place holder to map out all the projects that are being developed in class.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\n<legend><strong>Turn In</strong></legend>\r\nA pdf writeup in EEE labeled <b> yourname1_yourname2_carnival_proposal.pdf </b> containing the following:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Name of team members\r\n  <li> Paragraph of text desribing your proposed attraction.
