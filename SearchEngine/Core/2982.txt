The dropbox will have a automatic deadline of 12:30 pm on the given due date. <i> No homeworks will be accepted after that time</i>. I know this is a tough requirement, but in return, I'll award extra credit for early-submitted homeworks as described below. If you are working down to the last minute, <b> please </b> make sure something is uploaded 10 minutes prior to the deadline to ensure you won't get zero credit.\n\n\n<h3>Grading</h3>\n\nEach assignment has both programming and written components.  Your\ncode will be graded both on clarity and correctness.  \nIt is generally more important that your code be clear and\ncorrect than fast.  Your writeup should \nbe richly illustrated with graphs and images, and your code\nshould be well commented and documented.\n\n<h3>Extra-credit</h3>      \nAny homework that is handed in 24 hours early will get 10% extra-credit - e.g., 5 points for a 50-point assignment.\n    \n\n<h3>Homework Submission Instructions</h3>\n\n\n<p> Submit a zip or tar archive containing your code and your writeup into the appropriate directory in the <tt>EEE Dropbox</tt>.  Use the following directory structure:\n      \n<blockquote><tt><pre>\nYourName/code\nYourName/writeup.pdf\n</pre></tt></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe <tt>code</tt> subdirectory should contain all of your code.  Include\neverything that your code needs to run.  If I hand out code as part of the\nassignment, include that also.\n\n\n<p>\n\nZip the <tt>YourName</tt>  directory and upload <tt>YourName.zip</tt>\nto the EEE dropbox under the folder for the given project.\nYou can create a zip archive of the <tt>YourName</tt> directory in various ways:\n<p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li> Right-click on the folder and select \"Create archive\".\n  Select either \"zip\" or \"tar.gz\" to create the archive, or\n  <li> In a terminal, cd to the directory\n  containing <tt>YourName</tt> and type <tt>zip -r YourName\n  YourName</tt> to create <tt>YourName.zip</tt>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can list the contents of a zip archive with the command\n<tt>unzip -l YourName</tt>\n\n<h3>Homework Writeup Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>\nYou must submit your writeups as as a single PDF document following\nthis <a href=\"template/index.html\">template</a>. PDFs are\ncross-platform formats for encoding documents with text and\nimages. Most word processors (MS Word, Open Office, Apple's Pages)\ncan export PDFs. <em>I will not accept writeups in any word processing format such as MS Word or Open Office.</em>  \n            \n     \n<p>Some guidelines for your figures:\n\n<ul>\n\t\n  <!--\n  <p><li><b>Always show the colorbar for 2D data.</b>  Whether your are\n  showing an image or data in the form of an image, always show the\n  colorbar.  If you are showing an image, this will verify that the\n  color map spans the correct range (usually <tt>[0,1]</tt>).  If\n  you are showing data, then this will show the meaning of the colors.\n  The only exception is when you show RGB images; in that case, the\n  colorbar is meaningless because the colormap is not used.\n\t\n  <p><li><b>Use a sensible color map.</b>  There are 3 standard color\n  maps available to you: <tt>gray</tt>, <tt>jet</tt>,\n  and <tt>hsv</tt>.  In the few cases where your data is periodic\n  (such as with angles), then use <tt>colormap hsv</tt>.  Otherwise,\n  use <tt>gray</tt> or <tt>jet</tt>.  Which is appropriate\n  depends on what you are trying to show.  Use the colormap that most\n  effectively communicates your point.\n\n  <p><li><b>Use a proper display range.</b>  If you are showing a\n  grayscale image, make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors.\n  The <tt>imagesc</tt> command has an optional parameter for this\n  purpose, e.g. <tt>imagesc(im,[0,1])</tt> will make sure the color\n  map spans the range <tt>[0,1]</tt>.  If you are showing data, then\n  allowing <tt>imagesc</tt> to scale the color map to the range of\n  the data is usually appropriate.  If your data is mostly symmetric\n  around zero, then consider using a display range that is symmetric\n  around zero,\n  e.g. <nobr><tt>imagesc(im,[-1,1]*max(abs(im(:))))</tt></nobr>\t\n  -->\n\n  <p><li><b>Use imwrite() for saving images.</b>  To directly export\n  an image from Matlab, use the <tt>imwrite</tt> command.  \n\n  <p><li><b> Exporting figures. </b> Sometimes, you will plot lines/shapes over images in a figure window. To export a\n  figure window (containing an images with overlaid markings): Select\n  File > Save As... from the figure window, and export as an image (PNG, TIFF, JPG, etc.).\n  \n  <p><li><b>Use a proper size and aspect ratio for exported\nfigures.</b> Use the <tt>axis image</tt> command in MATLAB to make sure that pixels\nare displayed square.  If the image is not too large, ensure that image and screen pixels coincide with the <tt>truesize</tt> command.\n\n  <p><li><b> Make sure images in writeup are properly sized</b>. Large\nimages do not belong in your writeup. If you need to show image\ndetails in a figure, then show another image with a zoomed-in portion of the image.\n\n</ul>\n<hr>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "id": 2982.0}
